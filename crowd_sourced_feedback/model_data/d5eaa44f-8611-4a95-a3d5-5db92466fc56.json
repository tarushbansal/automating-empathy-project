It's like they don't want to do anything about it.", "2667": " That's great, I hope it works out for you. It's always nice to have a good landlord.", "2668": " How many kids do you have? I bet it's a lot of work, but I'm sure it's worth it.", "2669": " That's a good way to look at it. I'm sure they'll appreciate it when they're older.", "2670": " That's unfortunate.  Did you end up going on the beach at least?", "2671": " That sounds like a lot of fun. I love the beach. Did you have a good time?", "2672": " That sounds like a lot of fun. I hope you guys had a great time. Where did you go?", "2673": " Wow, that is a lot of money.  Did you buy a ticket with your winnings?", "2674": " I bet they were.  I would be too.

Did you ever find out what the secret was?", "2703": " I'm sorry you had to go through that. It's hard to trust anyone these days.", "2704": " Oh my gosh! I would have been so scared! Did you ever find out what it was?", "2705": " Oh my goodness! I would have been so scared! I'm glad you're okay!", "2706": " That sounds like a great time. What movie did you guys watch?

What did he get you? I hope it was something you really needed.", "3139": " Aww, I'm sorry to hear that. I bet he was a great dog. ", "3140": " Aww, that's so sweet.  Dogs are the best.  What kind of dog was he?", "3141": " No, I don't have any pets. I wish I had a dog, though.", "3142": " I agree.  I wish more people would take care of their animals.  They're so much better than people.", "3143": " Why does he scare you? Is it because you don't know how to do it?", "3144": " Oh no! I hope he didn't spill it all on you.

What are you going to do to prepare?", "3206": " Does he wake you up because he wants you to go to bed or because you don't want to wake him up?", "3207": " Maybe he just wants to cuddle with you. Cats can be very affectionate.", "3208": " Congratulations! That's a big accomplishment. What are you going to do now?", "3209": " I'm sure you'll do great!

It's hard to know what to do when someone lies to you.", "4540": " I hate when people do that. Did you say anything to her about it? Or did you just ignore it?", "4541": " I would have said something.  People are so rude these days.  I'm glad you didn't say anything.", "4542": " I hate when people do that.

What kind of job are you interviewing for? ", "4572": " That's a good way to look at it.  I hope you get the job!", "4573": " Chocolate chip cookies are the best! I love to bake them in the oven.", "4574": " I agree! My grandma used to make the best chocolate chip cookies. I miss her.", "4575": " Wow, that must have brought back a lot of memories. How old is your daughter now?", "4576": " Aww, that's so sweet. I wish I still had pictures of my kids from when they were little.", "4577": " That's awesome! I bet she's really good at it.

I'm sure you'll do great at it.", "4586": " Oh my goodness, that's terrible. I hope they caught the people who did it.", "4587": " I hope so too.  It's so sad to see animals in that situation.

I'm glad you were able to enjoy it. What team were you rooting for?", "4590": " Yeah, it's weird to think about how long it's been since I was a kid.", "4591": " Yeah, I know what you mean. I don't have any kids, so I can't really relate.", "4592": " I can't wait until my kids are old enough to go back to school so I can have more free time.", "4593": " Oh my goodness, that must have been so gross.

Did you throw it away or eat it?", "4629": " I know what you mean, i would have been so grossed out if that happened to me", "4630": " That must have been terrifying! Did you make it out of the hike without getting attacked?", "4631": " Did you try to scare it off or did you just try to get away from it?", "4632": " That's great! What kind of dog did you get? I've always wanted a dog.", "4633": " Charlie is such a cute name for a dog. I bet he is a great companion.", "4634": " Don't feel bad, it happens to the best of us. Did you eat it all?", "4635": " Don't worry, it happens to the best of us. I'm sure she'll forgive you.", "4636": " Oh my goodness! I would have been terrified! Did you get it out of your skin?", "4637": " I am glad you are okay, snakes scare me so much, I would have been so scared", "4638": " I know what you mean, I hate snakes. They are so scary and venomous.", "4639": " That's awesome! What kind of job do you have if you don't mind me asking?", "4640": " That is always a good thing. I am happy for you.

How long have you been together?", "4678": " That's a good way to look at it. I hope everything works out for you guys.", "4679": " I know what you mean. I'm in the same boat. It's hard to save money when you don't have a lot of money.", "4680": " That's a good idea. I try to do that as well. It's hard to save money sometimes.", "4681": " I'm so sorry to hear that.

Was it homemade?", "4727": " I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you can get some rest and feel better soon!", "4728": " That must have been awkward. Did you talk to the other guy or did you just ignore him?", "4729": " I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you are able to move on and find someone better.", "4730": " That's not good.  Did you call the police?  I hope he didn't hurt anyone.", "4731": " I would have called the police.  That is not okay at all.  Did you call the police?", "4732": " I bet it was.
