I bet you were so surprised!", "146": "Ha!  What a neat day to announce it - did they do any special kind of announcement?  I see so many videos of interesting and neat ways to make that announcement.", "147": "I do watch Netflix sometimes.  Do you watch?", "148": "I haven't heard of that one.

I argued if you are willing to date someone who likes to eat Popsicles in bed, then you have to deal with the consequences.", "187": "Okay, it wasn't just one, it was three: One cherry, and two grape. How anyone can eat just one at a time? Oh, the number of wrappers was also brought up. Like, I don't care if yuo bought them for the kids, I am part of this household as well. I tried to make it a teaching moment about how if you don't get the popsicles first someone else would, but I think my arguments have been falling on deaf ears for awhile now, lol", "188": "Wow.

How did that turn out?", "221": "That's how all pranks should be!", "222": "I am so sorry to hear that. Is there any chance you might be able to reconcile???", "223": "Oh that's too bad. ): I don't want to overstep but I always like to encourage people to hold on to their love for each other no matter what trials come up.", "224": "I think that's good! If you are meant to be together you'll feel it and it will work out I think, if you just keep your conviction and stick with it. Good luck with it!", "225": "Aw, that's sweet!

He's so against what the real conservative values are supposed to be.", "255": "Yeah, I am sad about the whole left vs. right thing in general.

Do you?", "261": "That's great. It sounds like a very good situation to be in.", "262": ":( I'm very sorry. Have you tried telling her how you feel? That could affect her decision.", "263": "I know it's hard to build the confidence needed to do something like that, but you don't want to keep them to yourself. If you really think she is the woman of your dreams then you have to try", "264": "I'm not quite following. Anything you want to tell me about?", "265": "Well did you have any story or anything that you had in mind that you wanted to tell me?

You have a good heart", "355": "You must feel awful,  Why don't you come clean, maybe you will feel better.", "356": "Yes Jesus can save you if you ask him.  He always forgive.", "357": "He deserved that, I think.", "358": "Wow, interesting.", "359": "Wow, you must have felt jealous", "360": "Hahahaa, its not easy though, I would have done same", "361": "When you have responsibilities that you really care about, you do what you have to. I commend him. ITs hard raising a family,", "362": "Oh wow. Ive never heard of that many sick days.", "363": "cool.", "364": "So, what was she lying to you about?", "365": "Oh, she shouldn't have done that", "366": "Oh no how horrible", "367": "oh no", "368": "I hate public schools ooo", "369": "But it's really cool atimes", "370": "Thats cool, I did online school in high school", "371": "Well were pretty close in age", "372": "I remember him, he was going to be a great actor.", "373": "Yeah he might do a pretty good job as that character.", "374": "Adapting to life is always good to do.", "375": "Thats a great attitude to have. You should keep with that.", "376": "How awful! how do you feel about it?", "377": "Yes I understand, it is really sad when you find that people you have known a long time can be very different from what you thought.", "378": "Lols why didn't you do anything", "379": "Awww but it's still good that you didn't push him, Cox it might lead to something else", "380": "Oh My Goodness!

I hope to get a house next year", "384": "I bet! Hard work pays off", "385": "Things happen that are bad, I am sure it wasnt your fault.", "386": "I am sure they forgave you in the end.", "387": "Music always seems to be better from the past, I understand all too well.", "388": "I totally agree, new music is not as good.", "389": "I get paid today as well! What game are you thinking about getting?", "390": "Didn't that game come out a few months ago? I got it shortly after I released and I wasn't very impressed. It wasn't a bad game, but it certainly was not the best game.", "391": "Congratulations. That sounds like the fast track.", "392": "Cool. Maybe next year you will be a partner!", "393": "I hope you get it", "394": "I am so sorry to hear that! Is there a particular section you are having trouble with?", "395": "Ah! That's quite understandable. It is tricky at first and non-intuitive. I practiced driving in reverse with cones in an abandoned lot.", "396": "I know it's hard, but practice makes perfect! Keep trying and I am sure you will get it!", "397": "Why what is the matter?", "398": "Hmmm! That is just annoying being an alcoholic. I purely understand your situation as I have gone through it. Well! life goes on.", "399": "that is great..congrats....", "400": "Thats creepy honestly", "401": "Yeah whispering in someones ear is weird", "402": "Nice! What job is going for", "403": "Cool.  Hope he gets it, I hear they pay pretty well", "404": "Just you. No security?", "405": "I would be too.", "406": "That's nice, how long did it take you ?", "407": "Fantastic, now do you have a job lined up?", "408": "I've been in a fender bender not a total wreck.", "409": "Man, how was your insurance policy for that?", "410": "Yes, Several times in my life. Mostly me and my older brother when we were younger.", "411": "What started the fist fight in the first place?", "412": "I haven't heard of it", "413": "Everything old makes a come back!", "414": "One of my favorite places to eat. I love the swirled ice cream cones.", "415": "Over priced food is no fun. I like dollar menus.", "416": "Yep! Not really that fun to have since you see things at times.", "417": "Man that is scary! Granted i like to hear things about that.", "418": "Yes when I was young I did all the time, but I think after I turned 18 I got this weird fear of being so high up in the air. What about you?", "419": "Wow thats really cool! You must be happy to know about that stuff its interesting!", "420": "What a creep. I hope that you told on him.", "421": "Some people are like that. Did you tell your husband?", "422": "Where are you headed ?", "423": "Great, I hope you have a nice trip. How long will you be staying?", "424": "That's great! It was meant to happen then", "425": "I would have been too. I've never been fired. I always quit", "426": "I remember taking Home Ec. I loved that class", "427": "Oh wow, puppies are nice.  What kind of puppy did you get?", "428": "Thats a nice breed of dog.  I just went on a camping trip with a relative who has one, they are very loyal and smart of course.  Was he/she your first pet?", "429": "that's good! you should be proud of yourself", "430": "that's great! i hate when people cheat", "431": "I can only imagine having to wait at the table alone, wondering if she'd show up. At least, it sounds like, she finally arrived.  Did she specify a reason for being so late?", "432": "That's good. I can somewhat relate. I think the longest I've waited on someone was a colleague who was supposed to meet us at happy hour, and ended up getting delayed by our boss for 45 minutes. We were glad she made it out, but I did feel worse for her than for all of us.", "433": "Ahhh! Me too, there is so much that can be done on the weekends!", "434": "I understand that! I have a bunch of pet snakes that wake me up thru the night!", "435": "Actually that has happened to me, during Thanksgiving", "436": "Im from NC mountains, it can be tricking driving when the snow is latying fast", "437": "That is a smart idea. Sometimes I would have no choice, but to keep going, bacsue of having to drive to work.No matter what the weather is.", "438": "I understand your pain. My parents are also separated.", "439": "It just makes you mature faster. Just look at it like blessing in disguise.", "440": "That sucks.   Did you end up coming up with an alternate plan?", "441": "That's good to hear.  How was the beach?", "442": "That would take away from her time with you. Was it for you?", "443": "That would be a really nice surprise then!", "444": "why'd you steal it", "445": "oh yea what kind of shirt was it", "446": "What did you do to pass the time?", "447": "I love video games.", "448": "That sucks, why didn't you find a new apartment?", "449": "Maybe you should leave Florida.", "450": "Oh thats nice, what was she able to get for you?", "451": "thats awesome of her to be able to get you something you really wanted", "452": "Omg, I have seen one of those!", "453": "I believe that!", "454": "What did you do?", "455": "Did she get mad at you?", "456": "haha that sucks! did you take him/her out to pee recently?", "457": "What did you have for lunch?", "458": "That is amazing, good work.", "459": "How long did it take you?", "460": "Oh wow. Did she break up with you?", "461": "Don't sweat it man. There is plenty of fish in the sea anyways.", "462": "Nice, I wish I could do a wheelie!", "463": "Yeah, I tried skateboarding in my childhood but was too scared to break something, lol.", "464": "Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. Did you ever figure out what happened?", "465": "Oh, well that's a somewhat happy ending I suppose.", "466": "Haha I'm sorry! My dog is chill now but he ate a hole in the wall when he was a puppy lol", "467": "Yeah lol what breed is yours? Mine is a golden so he loves eating stuff. Now it's thankfully just actual food.", "468": "Yea, I am like that, too. Did you apologize?", "469": "It happens. Like you said, we can't all be perfect.", "470": "Who did you do all those things with? Sounds like a wonderful day!", "471": "They must have been really happy.", "472": "There are so many spectacular views on this planet", "473": "It's a shame that people are letting these marvels pass them by.", "474": "That can really make you lose your faith in wanting to trust people", "475": "No not really because we are all human and make mistakes.", "476": "Oh, wow! My son was terrified of tornadoes because of that darn movie, and we don't really even get tornadoes where we live! Did you ever live through a tornado?", "477": "Aw, poor little thing! How did you overcome this? Or, are you still afraid of them?", "478": "Your mom sounds awesome!  Wow, what a cool thing to say!", "479": "We get carried away with our emotions sometimes. Did you explain it to them?", "480": "I'm glad you're not too prideful to admit your mistakes to your kids and used it as a teaching opportunity.", "481": "That is pretty awesome, I know if I ever got the chance it would change my life as well.", "482": "I understand that, as long as I could understand the language I think I would be great anywhere.", "483": "tell me more about this", "484": "if its an older iphone i would treasure it", "485": "everyone values things differently", "486": "What does he do for work?", "487": "Oh wow, that is a dangerous job.", "488": "have you had it tested ?", "489": "so you have like tunnel vision where ?", "490": "Yeah, that can be annoying especially in Walmart since so many people go there. It stresses you out when you don't need it to.", "491": "Yeah, everyone just seems miserable, so it kind of drags you down, too. But it's a necessary evil.", "492": "that is why I am scared to have kids, that sounds terrible", "493": "that seems to be the case, you win some you lose some I guess", "494": "Who would that be?", "495": "I love seeing mine too. I know how happy that must make you feel. Mine are local.", "496": "thats good to hear.  my kids will returning to school soon as well.  I cant wait!", "497": "thats cool", "498": "Every little accomplishment counts! What bills did you have to pay?", "499": "Sorry to hear that. Well, at least this will be a weight off your shoulders.", "500": "wow, you're so determined! Did you pass your exam?", "501": "yay! congrats! that's really awesome. you should be proud of yourself", "502": "That's really exciting! I would be so happy about that.", "503": "That's what I would do too. Do you have something in mind?", "504": "Forget him. Get yourself a real man.", "505": "If he really loved you, he would pay attention to your every need. Kick him to the curb.", "506": "Be positive. Don't deviate your mind while driving. Concentrate completely on driving. You can.", "507": "Sorry to hear this. Hope you'll get out from this fear and become a good driver.", "508": "Sounds cool.", "509": "Do you cook a lot with tomatoes", "510": "Good for you!", "511": "People just don't seem to pay attention when they are in a hurry.", "512": "That's the part that bothers me the most. When they just cut in front of you with no warning.", "513": "I know a lot of people in real life through that kind of stuff. Has been pretty great for me after 11 years. How is it for you so far.", "514": "Well we met through going to conventions and i even visited some myself. Really great bunch of people and i see places.", "515": "well you sound like a good person", "516": "why thank you!", "517": "Oh wow. That's crazy.", "518": "I'm glad you made amends then and no drama.", "519": "That's pretty amazing. She must be skillful regardless.", "520": "Yea, experience and skills matter a lot more.", "521": "I am familiar with that.  That is frustrating.", "522": "I ask myself the same thing.  Sometimes I think they get mad at something we do.", "523": "That is good. Do you have strong feeling for each other?", "524": "That is cute", "525": "Things? Like what kind of things?", "526": "I know what you mean! I'm literally doing the same thing right now, babysitting my neighbor's dogs in her big two-story house, all alone. Makes me feel like someone's watching me...", "527": "Thats really good to hear.  Whats going on?", "528": "I work from home too.  Its so nice to be able to do laundry and things on my breaks.  Im so productive around the house", "529": "and I can stay in my PJs all day long!", "530": "Yeah, of course I can! That sounds heartless. Maybe that shows you who your friends truly are, and you should maybe look elsewhere... Could be a wake-up call.", "531": "Oh, I misunderstood! I thought you meant you weren't invited to one that you later found out about. Hah! Then I guess the wake-up call is you have really good friends! So, you like surprise parties then? I never did.", "532": "What kinds of things are you talking about?", "533": "That's not very fair, a kind reminder could've gone a long way.", "534": "I have been there many times.", "535": "I love going to the Spurs games.", "536": "Wow that is a long time ago.", "537": "Yes, where did you go to college?", "538": "That is so disgusting.  I hate seeing that!", "539": "Sugar will do that to kids every time.  Just don't let them on a  roller coaster to make it even worse.", "540": "That sounds really painful!  You should pick them up.", "541": "They must not listen very well.", "542": "Qdoba is the BOMB! Although, I think I prefer Chipotle slightly more.", "543": "Yeah, but Chipotle has queso now! But, yeah, it isn't as good as Qdoba queso.", "544": "Wow! How is that even possible?", "545": "I wonder if they ever feel like they don't get a childhood?", "546": "Sounds like you are lucky.", "547": "That is great!", "548": "I figure your son is pretty happy as well.", "549": "couldn't ask for a better day", "550": "That is no fun, you always hope that first one hits so they are more receptive the rest of the time", "551": "Well there is always next time!", "552": "you should take the dogs to a dog park after work and meet people!", "553": "Definitely. I think even Waze app will tell you in you search 'around me'.", "554": "Wow, that is sweet of him, does he have a crush on you?", "555": "Huh, well maybe he is starting his campaign lol", "556": "What type of dog is it?", "557": "I get that, some are just not well trained at all", "558": "Oh? That's not good. Do you think he has lots of secrets?", "559": "I'm sorry :( I do hope things can be worked out", "560": "I assume you don't get to see them often?", "561": "That's too bad. I bet you miss them.", "562": "Sorry to hear about the bad news.", "563": "How long ago did she die?", "564": "I hope you got it.", "565": "Congrats! You deserve it for keeping your faith!", "566": "How old is she?", "567": "Well, you know she'll get over it, but it does hurt.", "568": "oh, how nice. What are your plans in that regard for the future?", "569": "What a dream come true for you that'll be.", "570": "Oh man, bills. That's awesome!", "571": "Does anyone help you with the bills?", "572": "awh thats so sweet how long have you two known one another?", "573": "sounds like a great friendship!", "574": "Oh no. How old is he?", "575": "Friendship is special. Did he do something to his friend?", "576": "Man, that's gotta be a horrible feeling. I think it would help if you try not to compare yourself to others.", "577": "I hope things turn out better for you. Keep fighting.", "578": "Oh man, that's awesome. I hope you get it!", "579": "Glad you rocked that interview. Sounds like it's gonna be a sweet gig.", "580": "Awww I bet that brought back memories.", "581": "What will you do with it now?", "582": "How so?", "583": "That's pretty much teaching their kids to worry about appearances than learning, too. That's too bad.", "584": "Did you name it?", "585": "That's cute. I bet he's happy.", "586": "You kinda want to hold their hand, but you know it's best they solve some problems on their own. You can't be with them all the time.", "587": "It is truely for the best. Try not to worry.", "588": "that's amazing! She must be excited.", "589": "Must be nice to have more income coming into the family.", "590": "Is he going to be okay?", "591": "Well I bet he appreciates that. We all want to be babied sometimes.", "592": "Lol. Did you tell her? You can just buy another one.", "593": "Just buy another one and don't eat it. lol", "594": "That's sucks. Does the culprit know?", "595": "That is unacceptable. What are you going to do?", "596": "That sounds so fun!", "597": "Take some medication with you just in case.", "598": "So...what happened to her", "599": "In real life? Or are you making this up", "600": "I've never imagined something like that before. Where did you see this?", "601": "That's nuts. Did the owner do anything?", "602": "I suffer a lot too when my wife is gone. What happened to him?", "603": "Ah, the evil cancer. Took my grandmother as well. I am sure he's off in a better place now.", "604": "Nice! How old is your nephew?", "605": "That's good. Gotta build and maintain those family bonds. I should be doing the same once my nephew gets older.", "606": "That sucks. Can you make it up to her somehow?", "607": "At least those things come in sets, so you can keep part of it?", "608": "It is a work award or something?", "609": "I am sure you are going to get it.", "610": "Why Thank you!", "611": "THanks for being so understanding!  I feel a little better now.", "612": "I know what you mean. Did you get the job?", "613": "I have not. What is it?", "614": "There are some bad parents out there, that's for sure. Is it hard to be a parent?", "615": "Lol, that is terrible. She should have changed his diaper before leaving the house what the heck...", "616": "That sucks. Maybe it's time to get new friends?", "617": "Don't worry, it will get better. I know you deserve better", "618": "I know exactly what you mean. My sister is entering her teenage years. I feel like it's all I can do to just not be annoying to her, so I can't even imagine what it's like for a mom.", "619": "That's good! All it takes is a good day once in a while to keep things on track until they get older. My mom just tries to be as patient and considerate with my sister so that she still feels motivated to communicate with her.", "620": "Where are you going?", "621": "I've never been to California.", "622": "That must of been terrible.", "623": "Did anyone help you?", "624": "You're making me want to do the same thing. That sounds great!", "625": "Nothing like relaxing and getting your body ready for a night of good sleep!", "626": "Was it on the phone or in person?", "627": "How did you do?", "628": "What are you referring to?", "629": "That is nce", "630": "thank you for what?", "631": "okay", "632": "you're welcome, but for what?", "633": "ok then lol", "634": "Cool. Thats a fun hobby.", "635": "Well habe fun I guess.", "636": "Oh no, what happened?", "637": "Oh, that's odd! I'm sorry they didn't tell you what was going on.", "638": "No problem! I hope so too. Good luck with that!", "639": "really?", "640": "ok", "641": "Who was your rep?", "642": "Aha. What was the association?", "643": "Did you got bored?", "644": "I understand.", "645": "That is a very long drive! How long will it take to get there?", "646": "It must be very good, if you're willing to go that far!", "647": "Wow, you're very lucky. Do you share the facilities with other people?", "648": "Which part of the country are you in? Are you by the beach?", "649": "Was it fun?", "650": "Was it recently? Happy Birthday", "651": "Oh goodness, what happened for the past 3 weeks?", "652": "Oh, I was thinking something bad happened.", "653": "Sorry to hear this! I can understand your pain.", "654": "Take care of yourself and your family.", "655": "I am sure it will be fine, do you have a preference", "656": "I am happy for you then", "657": "That is good, it is very important to be loyal in a healthy relationship!", "658": "Good for you! I wish more people were like this, unlike my ex!", "659": "You should channel that envy into motivation!", "660": "Exactly, be positive and you can buy one for yourself!", "661": "That is a great attitude to have!  It is great to have an optimistic approach to life.", "662": "I feel the same way.  We are a glass half full kind of people!", "663": "oh poor thing, is she at least getting better?", "664": "haha that must be nice too though, you get your own alone time for the most part!", "665": "I see, you must have felt hopeful", "666": "Good, one should always be positive", "667": "thats adorable how old is she?", "668": "she sounds like it", "669": "That's a pretty heavy realization...better tell him now that regret it later", "670": "Best of luck to you", "671": "what are your options?", "672": "oh yeah thats always going to be up and coming for sure", "673": "It is an excellent opportunity, to know other people and places, to open up to the possibility, I assure you that it will go to you very well", "674": "You do the same thing ... the opportunity is for both", "675": "That sounds like it's rough, did your father accept your apology?", "676": "Well, I'm sure he understands, and you shouldn't feel too bad, as long as you apologized you're fine.", "677": "it happens we have to reward ourselves sometimes. dark chocolate is actually good for you!", "678": "hey it was just one day! you got this... work extra hard for the next 5 days!", "679": "That's awesome", "680": "I'm sure your supportiveness inspires him to work as hard as he does", "681": "I totally feel you on that. I swear my neighbors have to be the loudest at night slamming their car doors and yelling outside right in front of my bedroom window.", "682": "My bedroom is first floor, and literally maybe 4 feet from the parking lot. Lucky me. Lucky you tho too with animals. lol", "683": "Did you retrace your steps", "684": "I used to lose stuff all the time.  Then I learned to relax and actively imagine all the places I'd been to.  It worked for me then, found a G-shock watch a pair of nikes and my wallet", "685": "that's great! I bet they are equally excited if not more :) are you travelling alone?", "686": "oh i bet! you guys will have such a wonderful time together", "687": "I would be too, that is a long time!", "688": "Wow that would make for a lonely timeframe", "689": "Wow did youcall someone about that?", "690": "Wow, that sucks, that is why I wanna live all alone!", "691": "Oh my, did they notice you farted?", "692": "Must have rather awkward. Remember, farting is just natural and I am sure she understands that.", "693": "I am sorry, how have you been passing the time", "694": "I love video games, you should buy a switch!", "695": "that is a very optimistic way to look at life . i should actually look at life that way too instead of getting overwhelmed when things do not go my way", "696": "how long have you looked at life this way? is it sustainable ?", "697": "this is completely true. it involves totally re conditioning the mind .", "698": "i would totally attempt it", "699": "I am so very sorry. Have you had time to talk about it", "700": "that's good prayer can comfort, maybe you should talk to your pastor", "701": "Ooh, that's a big jump. I was considering the same thing, but I' one state above :)", "702": "I put it on hold until I fly up there this year to check things out. It's quite a big decision, and I would recommend going there for a while just to see what it's like", "703": "Yes, realistically I wish it were possible to do that everyday but general stresses of life get in the way", "704": "Maybe thats a good idea, to try and set aside a small amount of time a day to do it instead of trying to do it all the time along with everything else going on. Good idea!", "705": "Do you have any hobbies that may help you to meet people?", "706": "Same here.  Try to take advantage of your gaming and be more outgoing during gametime.", "707": "You must be ver", "708": "*very excited.  (oops).  Where did she go?", "709": "where are you going", "710": "that sounds like fun, where in the ozakrs?", "711": "Sounds like you made the right decision.  What a bunch of A-holes", "712": "Hm maybe she liked you ha", "713": "Free pizza is good! How did you get it?", "714": "That is awesome!", "715": "It was fine how about you?", "716": "I'm not sure I feel comfortable telling you as we just met.", "717": "My day was great so far!  How about you?", "718": "That is good to hear!  I'm am sure you are grateful to experience such a good day!", "719": "Oh that sucks :( Maybe organize the socks better?", "720": "Ah. Well, chalk it up to one of those funny but awkward moments of life then!", "721": "That's great! When will you find out?", "722": "Good luck! I hope you get it.", "723": "I know how it feels to be homesick, but you have to put your wife first.", "724": "You and your wife should go out to events and try to meet new people.", "725": "Ohh man, that is a long time to be alone.  What are you going to do while she is gone?", "726": "I'm sorry.  Where did she go?", "727": "What happened? Did someone bump on your car?", "728": "Be carefull , you don't know the cray people that is out there.", "729": "That must have been awkward.", "730": "Don't worry about it. It happens to the best of us.", "731": "Nostalgia can be wonderful, can't it?", "732": "I feel the same when listening to 90s alternative music", "733": "What was going on!?", "734": "sounds like a lot of drama ugh i hope you get some rest tonight", "735": "that's really good you feel pretty secure about it then?", "736": "oh wow then that is really good! For someone to say that! You should be very proud of yourself.", "737": "Thar was an embarasing moment for sure", "738": "Maybe you are felling lonely these days?", "739": "Did you have an enemy or someone as a suspect?", "740": "Weird reaction. I feel like he should just do his job and not key your car.", "741": "What are you worrying about?", "742": "Well, I hope it's alright, heart problems is not something you should take lightly.", "743": "What is your favorite memory with your friends?", "744": "That sounds like so much fun! I'm glad you got to go back to revisit.", "745": "You deserved for graduating.", "746": "Just keep working hard and make them proud.", "747": "I'm glad to hear you have something you can lean on in hard times. I'm personally an Atheist but I can respect someone with faith.", "748": "I absolutely agree. As long as you aren't hurting anyone, do whatever you please!", "749": "Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that! It doesn't necessarily mean it went bad, though. Maybe they just had a more qualified candidate?", "750": "Keep your head up! Job hunting is usually stressful for most people. You got this!", "751": "I'm not jealous of my co-worker though?  What makes you think i'm jealous?", "752": "I didn't say that.", "753": "That would be sad, do you keep him in a cage?", "754": "That's nice, what does he enjoy watching?", "755": "Absolutely. Although the world isn't so black and white. Sometimes a person may have to steal to survive. Is it really wrong then?", "756": "I agree. Stealing someone else's possession when it wasn't necessary for your survival is despicable! I hate a thief!", "757": "That's so sad, I'm so sorry you had to go through that. How did it happen?", "758": "My goodness, that sounds like a tragedy. I'm sure she was a great dog friend of yours.", "759": "Do you have some big plans for the visit?", "760": "Uh oh, have you ever delivered a baby before?", "761": "Oh right, I am a doctor.", "762": "I am a baby delivering doctor!", "763": "What was the accomplishment again?", "764": "Wow, that's amazing. What made her want to go back to school?", "765": "What about this homeless person had you reevaluating things?", "766": "What's been bothering you at work? Are you not being fulfilled enough?", "767": "Oh no! I hope it didn't fall on anything or anyone!", "768": "Oh thats really nice! Its important to help each other out when things like that happen!", "769": "Who??? Male or female.Actor or singer?", "770": "Please tell me who she is!!!!!", "771": "I know exactly how you feel, I've been slipping back into paycheck to paycheck living recently. It was so much better when I had the money to pay for everything.", "772": "Hahaha yes, you are so right. Then again, I'm a Christian so I am also comforted when I remember that we have a real, more important and awesome life to look forward to one day.", "773": "Wow, that's terrible. Was anything stolen or damaged?", "774": "What a story, it's just unbelievable how these robbers have absolutely no morals.", "775": "That is is awful.Did you call the cops", "776": "You should install security cameras outside your house.", "777": "That's rough man. Got any back up interviews lined up?", "778": "I hope that you hear back from them soon. It ain't going to be rough forever - someone has got to recognize your worth eventually!", "779": "Oh no, that is terrible! What happened? What did you do!", "780": "I am so sorry that happened to you!", "781": "Yuck, sounds like an unpleasant feeling. How do you even get hair up there!", "782": "Well, at least she loves you. Maybe shoving all her hair up your nose is her way of telling you that.", "783": "Oh really?! Where you headed too?", "784": "Wow! Thats on the east side of Africa isn't it?", "785": "Did you have a severe diarreia or something?", "786": "I am sure your friend will forgive you.", "787": "Oh cool! How did you win it?", "788": "Oh cool! I love chess! What did you win?", "789": "Wow that's annoying, my husband is always telling me about his co-workers being the same way.", "790": "Yeah I see what you mean. Hopefully he might realize eventually.", "791": "Sometimes it is uncomfortable to have to wait for something or someone.", "792": "Well, a wise man said that having patience was a virtue, I think you're becoming a more virtuous person by waiting.", "793": "I think you should always focus on your strength then it won't matter who is there and what they say", "794": "Also having at least one  friend in such meetings  would help. Next time  go with someone you know", "795": "That's great, how wonderful! I hope y'all had a good time.", "796": "How great, I'm glad to hear that.", "797": "How old was the child?", "798": "Wow, that's awfully young for that kind of thing.", "799": "Oh that's not good. It is hard to put all your effort in and have it go nowhere", "800": "Sometimes revamping leads to more amazing results than you could have orginially anticipated", "801": "Oh no! Are you going away this weekend?", "802": "Hopefully, she answers soon. Maybe she's taking a nap or is in the shower.", "803": "I am in the same boat, but I think that I can still be very happy and very content with the little bit of money or lack of I have.", "804": "How funny! I know how you feel though. I have always been poor.", "805": "Happiness is within and I seek that all the time. Even rich people are sad and unhappy.", "806": "Why? How did that happen?", "807": "That's so sad. I feel sorry for you.", "808": "Yeah. Do you have back up plans for this issue?", "809": "That's nice, I'm glad you feel that way.", "810": "I do feel that way, I try to always have a Christian attitude.", "811": "That's nice of her! It's always good to have friends to fall on", "812": "Oh, that's even better. That's truly a friend you can rely on. You're very fortunate.", "813": "Skateboarders have some serious skills! I can barely walk a straight line.", "814": "We all have different talents. Mine do not lie in those kind of stunts either lol!", "815": "Maybe you could try to better that?", "816": "You could start a trend.", "817": "He will make it", "818": "It will help eventually", "819": "That must have been scary. It could have gone really badly.", "820": "I hope the owner knows better next time.", "821": "Oh man! I hear you. I rescue animals and it is VERY hard to potty train them!", "822": "For sure! It is much like potty training a kid. Actually I think dogs are easier then kids lol!", "823": "THat is stressful.  Are they ok?", "824": "That is really good to hear", "825": "I certainly do.  Lucky to be healthy and able", "826": "Good question.  I am thankful to be able to park my car in my garage!", "827": "I hope you get the job! What was the position you applied for?", "828": "That sounds like it pays nice?", "829": "No. Why do you ask?", "830": "I'm sorry to hear that. How far along in the process are you?", "831": "I actually do not have any kids right now", "832": "I heard that was a really fun game though!", "833": "Seems like we all have. Some people shirk having to though.", "834": "Oh no.I hope she gets better.", "835": "Well that's good, sometimes it's our failures that really show us what we're made of.", "836": "Congratulations. I am in my twenties and still can't drive so hopefully I will get my license next year.", "837": "Did you say anything to someone?", "838": "a Burger King near me got shut down for that!", "839": "No, I do not have kids. Yours?", "840": "I bet you were really proud!", "841": "Wow. Thats hard to believe lol.", "842": "Yeah, it sounds that way.", "843": "That must of been a pain! I hate waiting in lines for cashiers, they are so slow sometimes.", "844": "Stores should really open more checkouts when it is busy, especially during rush our!", "845": "Man, I'm so jealous of you. I love that new puppy stage, as tumultuous as it can be. There's just so much emotion and new feelings going on as you watch it grow.", "846": "Yeah, but then there's also those late nights where you have to take them out because they're not used to holding their pee/poop in. And also them peeing and pooping in the house as they learn not to do that to begin with. They just have unlimited energy, so it's hard to keep up sometimes, but also fun!", "847": "What were simpler times?", "848": "Ah, I see. Had a great childhood, hu?", "849": "Congrats! That would be really exciting. What was your project?", "850": "That's a very interesting topic. I would have loved to have seen that!", "851": "I know what that's like. I have three kids.", "852": "They never slept in the crib lol. I won't even make my son get a haircut because he cries so much when the clippers get close. I'm the wrong one to come to for advice lol", "853": "That sounds heavenly", "854": "I envy you.  Have fun!", "855": "Time sure does fly and change is inevitable", "856": "Thinking about past events can be very nostalgic", "857": "what happened?", "858": "time to find a new job it sounds like! good luck", "859": "Awesome! What is he in college for?", "860": "Holy goodness! That is really specialized. You should be very proud! :)", "861": "That is very good to hear, hopefully things truly turn around for him.", "862": "Not yet, i just have one dog.", "863": "Oh that's neat! Did you find anything good?", "864": "Oh I remember when those came out and everyone thought they were going to be worth millions someday!", "865": "Wow, that's incredible. I don't even make my own bed.", "866": "Of course... haha. Why doesn't anyone pay adults to make their beds?", "867": "Wow, that sounds very disgusting.", "868": "I hope the baby rat is okay.", "869": "I'm so sorry but great to hear she is better now!", "870": "Well I'm glad to hear it's resolved.", "871": "Oh that's nice, I love doing that. Did the cat seem happy?", "872": "Well how nice, that must have been fun.", "873": "Wow that must have been scary!", "874": "How long were you lost for?", "875": "Wow back up there friend, what are you talking about?", "876": "Context, what the heck are you talking about?", "877": "Seriously what the hell are you talking about??", "878": "Being jealous of another person is a perfectly fine response. Despite this, you never know what is going on behind the scenes, she may have taken out huge loans just to fund her trips.", "879": "I bet you would go on many vacations if you did the same as her. Instead, you are being a responsible person and doing what is best for your future.", "880": "You just had a baby?! I didn't even know you were expecting!", "881": "I'm so happy for you! Have you decided on a name yet?", "882": "Good for you! I have heard many great things about keto. How are you finding it?", "883": "Props to you for researching the diet without understanding how it works. Some people are just looking for ways to lose weight fast, but putting in effort goes a long way.", "884": "You must be over the moon happy.", "885": "Very funny. Have you decided on a name yet?", "886": "Happy belated Birthday! Did it turn out the way you had hoped?", "887": "What did you get instead?", "888": "Really? That is a good move", "889": "You have As because you have high interest in studying", "890": "Wow, that is truly incredible! What is your secret?", "891": "That is so true! You are a true weight loss warrior I think!", "892": "Do you like it now?", "893": "I like 2% as well.  It's perfect for cereal and chocolate milk!", "894": "Have you tried 1%?", "895": "That's great.  2% is much more healthful than whole milk.", "896": "so very bad ya", "897": "ok", "898": "Oh no! :(   How are you taking it?", "899": "Dang.  Please don't blame yourself.", "900": "Thats pretty long, how did you manage?", "901": "Yea, something calming helps during fraustrating moments, but at least you know how the route is now", "902": "Nice! Who's Robby? Is that your husband?", "903": "Aha! Was it actually your anniversary today? Happy Anniversary!", "904": "Oh, wow... um, that's crazy. Why did you do that?", "905": "I would imagine! I'd do the same thing if I was your dad, haha.", "906": "You sound like a caveman", "907": "Why you no hunt and send wife instead.", "908": "Oh I can relate to that especially if you are not prepared for it, it can get really scary", "909": "You guys will be alright trust me I  experienced same with my partner and now we are fine. Our kid is a teenager now. I am happy for you guys", "910": "Oh no! I'm not sure how all that works, but I thought that was fairly normal for a pregnat woman", "911": "Well I'm glad for you! And for him! A new life is exciting", "912": "That's so sad. You did your best. How old was she?", "913": "That's really good, though. It sounds like you gave her a great life.", "914": "Was he with you or just someone you wanted to be with?", "915": "In that case, you are better off without her.", "916": "Oh, wow, I wish my parents had done that! It would have saved me from the mountain of debt I have now", "917": "Well, I've always been of the mindset that (if they can) they should help the first 2 years as that's usually the break-in period. After that, the child should be able to manage", "918": "I bet that felt good to get out and experience that!", "919": "Oh I am sorry to hear that. I also enjoy dogs. They are one of life's great joys in my opinion.", "920": "You should take a vacation that will help you relax and see new stuff", "921": "Oh ok. In that case let someone very close like your mother come around to help you out. Having someone to talk to helps in times like this", "922": "That's awesome. Are you using any special types of lotion?", "923": "I'll have to do the same! I wish my skin looked better than it does.", "924": "You must be wealthy. I would love to visit NYC", "925": "OMG! I know how you feel", "926": "Oh, me too! I love digging out my N64 and SNES from time to time.", "927": "Yes, that Yamaha sound chip was magical. We call it the Genesis over here.", "928": "Oh goodness, what was it?", "929": "Wow, that must have been a terrible experience.", "930": "so very nice.your doughter.", "931": "whove very nice ya and super talent.", "932": "What does what mean exactly?", "933": "Well whatever went wrong, I hope it can be fixed somehow.", "934": "Oh no! Did you take the kitten to an animal hospital or care for it yourself?", "935": "Awe, that's a sweet story! The kitten got a happy ending!", "936": "That's great! Who did the travelling?", "937": "She must be a strong woman.", "938": "Oh no. I hope you got somewhere safe while it was going on.", "939": "That's good at least. Living in an area with tornados is so scary!", "940": "Oh that is fantastic! I bet your brother was pretty happy too.", "941": "That is very sweet. I think they will have a happy and lasting marriage.", "942": "That's exciting! What kind are you looking for?", "943": "Ah. Hopefully something with good gas mileage!", "944": "OK ,have you done the need full?", "945": "OK get started already. A stich in time saves nine  !", "946": "Oh I think I can guess which retailer you're talking about. I've had so many problems with them over the years", "947": "I know. Canada isn't even overseas in the literal sense, it's just over the border!", "948": "Unbelievable. You must be very angry with her (whoever she is).", "949": "Neither would I, I dislike such greedy people", "950": "Wow that must have been frustrating.  I hope it didn't cost too much.", "951": "I know how that is.  At least you have your car back!", "952": "I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds very rough. What happened to it?", "953": "Oh jeez that's really awful. Can you get it back?", "954": "What didn't she like?", "955": "Well that makes sense.", "956": "Congrats you have a baby on the way", "957": "How many kids do you want in total?", "958": "Oh no. How did you handle having two such big priorities come up?", "959": "Oh, sorry to hear. I am sure your child was glad you were home. Is she or he feeling better now?", "960": "Sit where?", "961": "The club isn't a great place to find the right kind of girl anyways.", "962": "What happened!", "963": "This somehow seems inappropriate.", "964": "What is your plan to accomplish that?", "965": "Just don't over do, you have to enjoy being a parent, that's a key to happy kids.", "966": "Did you spill something?", "967": "Was it liquid ?", "968": "What was brutal?", "969": "Really? No shower for few days?", "970": "ok. I understand", "971": "i would feel terrible to thats really bad, you should just tell her and change!", "972": "The truth can set us free, probably better for her and you both.", "973": "Sorry to hear that... they say time heals everything but i disagree its been 9 years for me and it still feels like yesterday. How long for you?", "974": "Im really sorry for your loss! I hope that someday it gets better for the both of us.", "975": "Oh I love seeing kids achieve things! Adorable. Good for her! :)", "976": "I am sure, I would be too of my daughter. You sound like an awesome parent.", "977": "oh.. well i understand. but that was a long time ago right?", "978": "come clean to them about any major lies, you'll feel better :)", "979": "haha.. i feel you. my mom feels the same way", "980": "Amen sister! women always keep things in check", "981": "thats really good of you. she is a lucky gal", "982": "haha.. i guess she was not as good as your girl huh?", "983": "Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Are you considering getting a new dog?", "984": "I understand, mine just turned 15 and I'm not looking forward to that day.", "985": "Jeez people just always have to be in a hurry to get no where right.", "986": "people are just selfish and only consider their own lives!", "987": "What was that?", "988": "It's okay.", "989": "That is pretty cool! What made you want to become a lawyer?", "990": "Great! I know it can be a tough job, I am sure you will do fine, keep studying!", "991": "That sucks.", "992": "Well there are plenty more girls out there", "993": "Oh no.

I would be very happy too!", "1014": "oh its hurts a little", "1015": "wow thats great", "1016": "Me too! Have you ever been to one of them races?", "1017": "Oh cool, do you live in the city?", "1018": "That is awesome!  Is there a particular reason you are so happy?", "1019": "That is something to be happy about!  Congratulations!", "1020": "That is an exciting purchase! What kind did you get?", "1021": "That is a nice car! I know you are enjoying that!", "1022": "That was such a nice thing to do! She seems very caring!", "1023": "That is so nice that she made note that you had been wanting it for so long!", "1024": "That is SO exciting! I remember how that felt!", "1025": "That will come! The hardest part is over now!", "1026": "I remember how that felt! I always hated having to wait for grades.", "1027": "Awesome! Strategic Management sounds difficult by itself, I hope you get the grade you need!", "1028": "That sounds awful. Are you going to see them again?", "1029": "It's probably best that you don't see them, then. Good thinking.", "1030": "That must have been a difficult time for you.", "1031": "The company you work for is horrible. They should have gave you that time off because it was a family emergency.", "1032": "Ew, that is not good! I wouldn't have been able to stay and eat.", "1033": "I do not blame you!", "1034": "that is awesome, i feel the same when i drive by my grandparents old home", "1035": "yes i was", "1036": "That is exciting!

NE FL, I know how you feel, only I couldn't get gas for my car because there was no gas anywhere!", "1039": "Yeah you thought ahead, me not so much. Our house was fine but a HUGE mess to clean up in the yard and no power for 2 days. I hope your house was ok too!", "1040": "Was it a checkup or did you have some health issue?", "1041": "Did everything go well or do you not know yet?", "1042": "Oh man, I bet that is fun", "1043": "No, I have always wanted one though", "1044": "Was it someone you know? Sorry for your loss if it was.", "1045": "I'm sorry did you get to see her a lot before she passed?", "1046": "Omg! That is terrible. They should really be considerate of people's time", "1047": "Right. Did he at least apologize for the long wait", "1048": "Wow! I would write a review, and choose another doctor who actually cares about his patient!", "1049": "Good luck! What is it on?", "1050": "How much studying did you do leading up to it?", "1051": "Oh man, I bet that will be fun", "1052": "I have, I love going when I can", "1053": "That's really nice of him! How long have you been married?", "1054": "Well you made the right choice in man to marry lol. What kind of necklace?", "1055": "That either sounds like a locket, or a heart shaped key. Am I close at all?", "1056": "Cool I think I saw a commercial for that actually.", "1057": "Ut oh.. what happened?", "1058": "hehehe.. don't mind if I giggle do you?  You need to remember... don't feel embarrassed bout silly stuff like that.  Those people don't know you or really care.  They laugh like I did because its fun to see things happen to other people that we fear.", "1059": "What are you going to do about it", "1060": "Well be careful for sure", "1061": "I am sorry to hear that. Have you ever talked to your parents about that?", "1062": "Yes, you do.Otherwise, you are going to carry that pain the rest of your life.", "1063": "That is great that your hard work has paid off.", "1064": "Now you having something to celebrate.

What do you have planned?", "1076": "I bet she is going to be so surprised!  Is she hard to surpise?", "1077": "Well I'm sure everything will go great!", "1078": "yeah that's tough. But can you imagine how bad you might feel if he had a REALLY good time on the date and really thought things were going somewhere with the two of you?", "1079": "That is true. Either way it seems like he definitely got the hint.", "1080": "Oh wow, I have heard that can happen with that food", "1081": "Ha, that is funny", "1082": "ewww! that is just super gross dude!", "1083": "Oh man that is just crazy! Feel bad for the person who has to clean it.", "1084": "I would love to have that tv", "1085": "Keep it, the guilt will go away", "1086": "Women these days. I don't think i'll ever understand them.", "1087": "Exactly, sometimes I think women like drama.", "1088": "It must have been fun to catch up with them.", "1089": "Well I hope you guys continue to stay in touch.", "1090": "Going to college is a good thing, but taking classes in the summer can really stink. At least you'll get to graduate sooner.", "1091": "That is the craziest thing I have ever heard.", "1092": "That's awesome. What are you going to do about it?", "1093": "I'm envious. Do you have any idea of what those plans are?", "1094": "oh i know friends like those", "1095": "i believe you", "1096": "Oh wow, sounds dangerous. Were you able to stay home and not venture out in it?", "1097": "Did you have any damage to your home?", "1098": "That's really sad. Is there a cure for Lupus?", "1099": "I am sorry about that. Is it contagious?", "1100": "When did you get separated? By the way, that is terrible to hear.", "1101": "Why are you so down, my depressed friend?", "1102": "Uh oh!  What did it end up coming from?", "1103": "Yuck!  Clean that up quick so it doesn't grow mold!", "1104": "I hate to hear that, what happened that made it end poorly?", "1105": "maybe you can plan another trip together soon - sounds like you guys need some time to reconnect and just truly enjoy each other.", "1106": "I know the feeling.", "1107": "Leave a note on their door. and at the end put thanks in advance lol", "1108": "Well, you can at least try.", "1109": "You could get earplugs lol", "1110": "Oh man! What happened to your hip?", "1111": "Oh my god..I had doctors really mess me up too. I am in a lawsuit. Have you thought about contacting an attorney?", "1112": "If it's medical malpractice actually you can get a good amount. Mine is still in talks, it's only been 6 months. Medical malpractice lawyers usually take you on for free if they like your case :) You can always try and you won't be charged if you don't win. It's pretty painless..people killed my child and almost me..", "1113": "Thank you! I hear you..I didn't want to do it at first...but it's worth it for her..It's a few people I am suing.including midwives. If it prevents another childs death then its worth it! You should really look in too it, botched surgery and nerve pain can be horrible! I hope you get better!", "1114": "Are you looking forward to the weather this weekend?", "1115": "Nice! Mowing the lawn isn't fun in the heat unless you're using a super fast one of course", "1116": "I agree, the writing part is easy part, but the speaking part is the worst!", "1117": "Maybe so, they say to imagine the crowd naked, but I don't think that helps too much with the writing part.", "1118": "Same. What are your favorites?", "1119": "That's funny. I've also seen Trolls about 100 times. My daughter is now sick of it!", "1120": "I've noticed a lot of the newer kids movies have adult jokes in them.", "1121": "Yeah maybe that... they are also lazier.", "1122": "Yeah I get that. Where did you work?", "1123": "Oh yum. Not a terrible place to work!", "1124": "Yes , work is better with friends.", "1125": "Really? I'm surprised the only restaurant in town wasn't busy.", "1126": "Did you see that happen today?", "1127": "That's pretty cool.  What a nice person.", "1128": "Whoa!  What were you driving that had no brakes?", "1129": "That sounds quite scary!  Did everything turn out OK?", "1130": "Haha!  Awkward.  What did you do?  Did you hurry up and get out of there?", "1131": "Same here.  I would rather just leave the situation.", "1132": "That's great.", "1133": "Congrats. I want a promotion at my job.", "1134": "three years.", "1135": "I think I'm just going to move on.", "1136": "Oh wow! What are you going to buy with all that sweet loot? Firecrackers?", "1137": "That sound like a wise decision. I think I would just get a blow up doll instead.", "1138": "Cool. Does that get a bonus?", "1139": "That's awesome.", "1140": "Well now you know you're pretty great at your job.", "1141": "Was he upset?", "1142": "I hate when that happens.", "1143": "I hate ggrocery shopping period. Too many decisions", "1144": "You are so right.", "1145": "Did you go back?", "1146": "Maybe you should let him get a couple of things to make up for it.", "1147": "Or you can get a variety pack!", "1148": "That's nice. I could get that here.", "1149": "Well now you know.", "1150": "Noice!  What was it about?", "1151": "Very cool, are you a scientist?", "1152": "Oh no! That's awful.  Or maybe a good thing if he wasn't good for you.  How are you feeling?", "1153": "I bet.  It can be brutal with the change and not having someone but you have to trust yourself that you are doing the right thing.  Its a good time to grieve your time together and then move on and find yourself again.", "1154": "Congratulations!  That is amazing!  You must be a hard worker.  What do you do?", "1155": "That's an important job though!  You're keeping things running smoothly for that business to thrive.  I'm so happy for you.  Money is tight for me so when I hear someone getting a bonus...it just makes me so happy for them to get that added chunk of money!", "1156": "I wish I could relate. I'm a male, so I'll never know the pain and/or the reward that comes with growing a human being inside your body. It's such an impressive thing to go through, and no matter what, mothers will never get enough credit. You deserve serious props. What ages are they now?", "1157": "Yeah, I'll consider it. That's a nice thought. My brothers have had 5 kids between them, so I have plenty of nieces and nephews to deal with in the meantime, and they've given me lots of practice, but I'm grateful for that. 15 and 19, that's awesome. You're almost all the way through getting both of them to a stage where your job becomes a little easier.", "1158": "It what?  Its way higher?  If that's what you meant to finish with then I totally feel you.  Especially during the summer with the air conditioning running so much.", "1159": "It is ridiculous.  I found out how they measure power that people use in their houses and it doesn't even sound fair to me.  It averages things because it can't specifically tell.", "1160": "Wow, school is right around the corner", "1161": "Well that should relieve some stress", "1162": "Everyone has those kinds of days, it happens", "1163": "I am sure they have forgotten about it", "1164": "Why not? What was wrong?", "1165": "Aww I'm sorry. That's a bummer.", "1166": "It sounds very motivational.", "1167": "He must be a great speaker.", "1168": "What are you saving for?", "1169": "I am sure everything will be fine. Do not stress.", "1170": "I hope you did well on it.", "1171": "Just hope for the best and don't worry.", "1172": "That's great!  I'm happy for you.", "1173": "What are those things?", "1174": "That sounds so exciting! Congratulations!", "1175": "It sounds like you live in a great community.", "1176": "Oh man. Hopefully things are different now and you have the confidence that you need!", "1177": "Nothing like taking it out on the weights and gaining the muscles in return!", "1178": "I understand that. I am the same way.", "1179": "I cannot function if I eat anything other than my usual breakfast.", "1180": "Unfortunately, I have very little discipline. I'm probably too addicted to carbs to get fit very quickly.", "1181": "How so?", "1182": "wow. When that happened?", "1183": "Sorry to hear that. I hope your insurer will call you back soon.", "1184": "It is unacceptable. I hope he did not get cold as a result of this", "1185": "That is pretty sad and heart-breaking to see kids in such situations", "1186": "Do you have plans to get together?", "1187": "How nice of her. You must have been so happy to see her.", "1188": "There are usually many ways, but it depends on what you want to do!", "1189": "Well, we all want to work from home but it takes a lot of work and sweat to make that a reality for most of us", "1190": "That is so exciting.  what have you done to prepare", "1191": "the buggy is important,  I have a baby boy of my own.", "1192": "Do you have a baby one the way?", "1193": "do you make enough money to support the baby?", "1194": "oof that is rough.", "1195": "those foids deserve it.", "1196": "Yes, you only hurt yourself when you get angry.", "1197": "Give it some time, maybe she'll change her mind.", "1198": "thats so sweet of you", "1199": "oh yea i can imagine glad shes fine", "1200": "Wow. Do you expect to win?", "1201": "That is nice. Good luck.", "1202": "Nice, me too, are you playing Nintendo games?", "1203": "I remember these game well, like Contra and Battle Toads.", "1204": "Was it your first time riding on one? Is there something in particular that makes you afraid?", "1205": "Was it your only choice to get where you were going?", "1206": "Great, what make are getting?", "1207": "Toyota is reliable, are getting an SUV?", "1208": "Interesting choice. Did she like it?", "1209": "That's good to have something in common. Make the memories.", "1210": "So what is the problem exactly?", "1211": "Try doing something you never did before.", "1212": "It is disgusting. What did you do?", "1213": "You did good. You should have called the manager to tell him know.", "1214": "There are so many bike trails available now. You are going to have a lot of fun.", "1215": "I'm glad you were able to get one that you are going to enjoy so much.", "1216": "That's a big step. I hope it works out for you.", "1217": "I like renovation projects. And yes, renting is a waste of money", "1218": "I feel you, I'm in the same boat.  Are you in a two income household?", "1219": "Yep, money spent on bills and food, with little left for fun.  My wife has the same complaint.", "1220": "Oh no, that sounds horrible", "1221": "I am sorry, that is a sad thing to go through", "1222": "Why would you not get paid?", "1223": "I can imagine it is", "1224": "Oh my, did it make you emotional?", "1225": "Aw hopefully you never lose that picture!", "1226": "Oh what was the surprise?!", "1227": "You should go on a little date if you can. or to the movies!", "1228": "You should have taken a Uber. You never know what will happen these days.", "1229": "No problem. Its also worth carrying a taser or pepper spray.", "1230": "did you pay him back?", "1231": "thats good thetn", "1232": "Oh my, so close! But you can try better next time.", "1233": "Yes and theres no point mulling over it!", "1234": "wow thats crazy.. what ended up happening!", "1235": "wow thats good", "1236": "aww.. that must have been a sweet nostaligia. did you had a collection of those?", "1237": "I feel happy for ya!

As long as you keep working hard and trying your best you can do it!", "1240": "Are you talking about the city or a person?", "1241": "I didn't know this broadway show but it seems nice.", "1242": "Yeah, I love going to the beach as well! You must have felt so happy there in that moment!", "1243": "I feel happy and content just sitting here listening to you describe the experience.", "1244": "oooh no that's awful", "1245": "ok but did you pass the test", "1246": "That sound amazing.  Dancing is very bonding.", "1247": "Well, a night out dancing will go a long way towards reconnecting with the love of your life.  I am happy for you!", "1248": "im sorry to hear that.. what happened?", "1249": "oh.. wow.. sorry that it happened.", "1250": "Oh sorry, did he pass away?", "1251": "Oh my god.. my hearty condolences.", "1252": "That is really cool .

I have a 20-year-old, and he is currently ignoring me.", "1315": "I understand that. I tried to give him a new table for his apartment, and he blatantly ignored me. I was like, well I don't have to give it to you.", "1316": "That blows dude , i bet it was not your fault", "1317": "So they just cleaned house ? Damn that bad , i would assume they would have kept some workers", "1318": "I thought walmart was pretty cheap.  I've never been to aldi's", "1319": "I may need to see if I have one near by.", "1320": "I know right? everyone is, with Lebron James coming in", "1321": "So true.

What kind of dancing did you do?", "1333": "Oh wow, that does sound fun", "1334": "Well, if you are willing to try steroids, then you might have a chance of winning. Without it, it is impossible to even participate", "1335": "Well in those contests, you have to be really pumped and by just fruits and vegetables, it is very unlikely", "1336": "For work, when i got a new job", "1337": "I'm so sorry.  You have my deepest condolences. Its hard to not feel isolation with the death of someone you are close to.  I can tell you it does get better and you are not alone.  He lives on in you.", "1338": "Take joy and pride in the memories you have of him.  They are your personal family movies in your mind.  Cherish them because not everyone gets them with their parents.  Its good to find support and counseling too if you need it. Take care of yourself.", "1339": "Yeah, i know that feeling. how did you handle it?", "1340": "Good for you buddy :) happy for ya", "1341": "Big houses are a pain in the neck to keep clean.", "1342": "It does have its benefits.", "1343": "damn, thats sick and rough.. He knew you guys were together?", "1344": "Can't say he did not deserve that..", "1345": "That's wonderful!  I do too.  I don't take it for granted because I've been battling Lupus for 13 years and in bed a lot.  Its an amazing world we have! What is on of your favorite things to do outside?", "1346": "Sounds wonderful!  I really want to take up gardening.  It would go with my new lifestyle I've adopted of eating plant based.  Do you have tips for a beginner?", "1347": "The rap version?   Doesn't sound all that appealing to me.  Was it that good?", "1348": "Maybe i'll have to check it out", "1349": "how did that go", "1350": "oh thats awesome.. congrats", "1351": "Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement", "1352": "for faith there is no path it is an individual human's thought", "1353": "I am not, I am still young", "1354": "I hope so, I am still not sure if I want kids", "1355": "I have anxiety attacks too,  you feel like you cant catch your breath and you are light headed.", "1356": "that is crazy,  Its only usually a few minutes for me before I can talk myself down.", "1357": "Don't worry. It will be okay. Flights are always safe", "1358": "Its natural. Do not sweat it.", "1359": "That will be *such* a wonderful feeling when you do. I know it's hard when you see someone reach the finish line first -- are you able to turn that envy into inspiration?", "1360": "See? That's terrific! And she's got to love that you can celebrate her victories too -- even more inspiration to support yours!", "1361": "I'm like that too, so I can totally relate. Were you able to talk to him about how you felt?", "1362": "I've felt the same way. As I have aged and become more comfortable and secure in my marriage and in myself, those other insecurities and fears dropped off. Good for you for conquering that challenge!", "1363": "Oh, that must be exciting! I bet you were busy making preparations.", "1364": "That sounds like it was a lot to take in! Congrats to them!", "1365": "wow.. what do you plan to do ?", "1366": "yea i can understand that", "1367": "Oh really? How did it go?", "1368": "Great job! I'm so happy for you! Losing weight is hard!", "1369": "That sounds exciting! Congratulations to her. I bet there was a lot of celebration to be had for such an achievement!", "1370": "I bet! But at least now, like you said, she can see what hard work can achieve. Hopefully the path continues in the best way possible and she can get everything you both hope(d) for!", "1371": "Did that person betrayed you in any way?", "1372": "Don't be so hard on yourself for being a frien and trust another people.", "1373": "I love reuniting with old friends, helps me remember and appreciate the good times.", "1374": "I bet that was a long time ago!", "1375": "I'm sure you studied hard and should be proud of that! I'm positive you nailed it.", "1376": "Being competitive isn't a bad thing unless you let it get in the way of your personal life.", "1377": "How did you meet your friend?!", "1378": "College and high school friends are always close to the heart. I'm glad she lives fairly close!", "1379": "That is unfortunate. I hope that it is able to be treated well.", "1380": "I hope it goes as smooth as possible. Hang in there.", "1381": "Wait, were they leaving to go somewhere or like dying? Either one is a little sad to be honest.", "1382": "It's like losing a family member :(", "1383": "What happened to him? Are you guys roommates?", "1384": "That is very bad. Unemployed individual can be very frustrating to deal with", "1385": "How did they lose so much weight compared to you?", "1386": "Maybe it has something to do with your diet ?", "1387": "Getting out of town and way from all of everday life's struggles always sounds like a great time.  Did you leave you cell phone at home while you weer away to 'really' get away from everything for a minute?", "1388": "That sounds like a really relaxing time, I'm jealous.", "1389": "No refunds for a cancel 1 week before? That sounds like a total scam! I would be furious. Did you ever find a way to get your money back? Because that does not sound legal!", "1390": "I hope that you win your money back and then some, you really deserve it after all of that upset!", "1391": "Lovely.  What did you do together?", "1392": "Sounds like a great time.  What has brought that memory back up again>", "1393": "That must feel lonely.  You should go out and try to meet some people!", "1394": "Good deal!  Hopefully then you won't feel so alone!", "1395": "That is frightening! especially if you didn't know whether it was a harmful spider or not! What did you do?", "1396": "Oh, so you were able to get that spider away from you! Good job, hopefully that won't have to happen to you again!", "1397": "Wait, summers already over? Next summer?", "1398": "Oh really? I thought summer ended after July. You learn something new everyday lol", "1399": "You should get a mini fridge and put it in your room, with a lock on it.", "1400": "Yea man go for it, don't procrastinate.", "1401": "Wow, that truly is devastating. I wish your family can make it through these hard times :(", "1402": "If my sister died to breast cancer, I would be so depressed to the point of my health deteriorating too. :(", "1403": "Amen to that.Life is so unfair it's not even funny.", "1404": "Life is so complex.We had no idea of the design of that", "1405": "What is the state and do you like change?", "1406": "Oh that is all the way into the cold and wet wild! Do you have or will you think of getting sled dogs?", "1407": "lol, right. You will have great fun!", "1408": "I agree!

Congrats!", "1413": "Oh, lol. Did you get to see any sharks at the aquarium?", "1414": "Oh cool, yes that is very interesting. So how big were those whales in feet and the baby too?", "1415": "I know how you feel! What did you watch?", "1416": "It is a pretty good horror.", "1417": "That is very impressive. She going to make sooo much money", "1418": "Any employer would hire someone who went to Harvard in a heartbeat. You are a lucky parent!", "1419": "Nice what kind of car is it they purchased?", "1420": "Ok that is a nice car what color is it??", "1421": "That is excellent, what did you major in?", "1422": "Oh cool. Do you want to work as a scientist?", "1423": "Sorry to hear about that.  I wonder if there's any way to fix this situation.  What do you plan to do?", "1424": "Coming clean is a great way to start.  It's hard since you know she'll be hurt.  Were you having trouble in the relationship before?", "1425": "When is the last time you seen them?", "1426": "That's awesome I hope yall have a good time!", "1427": "Do you still talk with any of your older friends?", "1428": "Do you have little time from working or other things?", "1429": "Yikes what was it about?", "1430": "creepy.  Were you able to fall asleep after watching it?", "1431": "That's great. I bet it is a very special place for you two.", "1432": "Sounds like a nice little place. I am glad you two have that spot to share.", "1433": "at least Riley passed in their sleep. Hopefully they didn't suffer. i'm sorry you lost a loved one.", "1434": "i have a big doofy mutt who is a 75 lb lap dog in his heart. i know the feeling", "1435": "I absolutely agree. I really hope he doesn't win in 2020.", "1436": "He's like an angry child trying to make everything about himself!", "1437": "Dang, that sucks. MAybe they can visit you instead?", "1438": "Ah, gotcha. Well I hope you heal fast!", "1439": "I guess you don't live in Alabama? Was it overall a good trip....or challenging? Or both!", "1440": "Well, if the drive was the most challenging it sounds like a good trip! Too often it's family dynamics that are *more* challenging -- and not so easily taken care of. ;-)", "1441": "That is the worst!! I know that you must have been very frustrated with your teammate.", "1442": "There have been a number of times where this has happened to me too. I hope that doesn't happen to you too much in the future!! :)", "1443": "I hate bees and wasps so much. Maybe you should call pest control?", "1444": "That sucks, I hope you get it figured out!", "1445": "wow, it must have been quite an experience", "1446": "My prayers are with you buddy. Stay safe", "1447": "Awesome. What breed did you own?", "1448": "I love paints, and growing up we had 2 quarter horses that my dad used for calf roping.", "1449": "10 minutes is a good time to be able to change a tire. I do not think I could change a tire own my own.", "1450": "Practice makes perfect, or makes you fast in your case.", "1451": "I would be too! Did you to it?", "1452": "So did you regret doing it? Or were you super proud that you did?", "1453": "You must be so proud!", "1454": "I don't think you're being selfish, you're doing your best!", "1455": "What state are you going to move to?", "1456": "Oh that is nice, will you be going skiing?", "1457": "Who doesn't..  everyone should do it!

They should have let you know they where going to do the job.", "1461": "That's terrible. People need to learn to commit to their promises.", "1462": "I don't understand how so many people value emotion over logic and reason!", "1463": "oh, that is nerve wracking. What did you try to do to cope?", "1464": "Better living through chemistry! I'm glad you made it through.", "1465": "That is really nice of him.  Did the other people get mad because they had to wait?", "1466": "Lucky you.  Where I live people are not so nice.  Can I move there?", "1467": "I am in Central FL... so uhh.", "1468": "Ouch, I would try and wear something on your neck next time you go in there.", "1469": "Hmm, wear something thick and long. Maybe hockey pads!", "1470": "Ut oh.. what happened?", "1471": "But at least you lucked out and they brought it back!", "1472": "Ah, I know what you mean! And remember *yearning* to be older?! (And of course the adults in *our* lives were shaking their heads, thinking the way we are now ;-))", "1473": "As long as you keep your playful spirit, you're in good shape! Sometimes it takes work to hold that awareness, but I can see it in you!", "1474": "It's awesome to have a job where you feel rewarded through what you do. What do you do?", "1475": "That sounds like a lot of fun, it's so rewarding to have a position where you can engage with other people. You really seem motivating and inspiring, so I'm happy you have that job!", "1476": "What did you do after waiting for 2 hours?", "1477": "Silver linings do happen, maybe is was a good thing your friend forgot about you.", "1478": "Maybe not a true friend after all.", "1479": "I bet. How much did she win and did she offer to share?!", "1480": "That's a lot of money, to me anyway. Perhaps she's got a lot of debt to pay off, or perhaps she has kids to take care of?", "1481": "Good job! You must have worked hard and prepared. Or are you just naturally really smart?", "1482": "Well done! You should be proud.", "1483": "If I'm understanding you correctly, they're going to clean it up, right?", "1484": "Wow, that's fantastic news indeed! How long has it been derelict?", "1485": "What did they or the person do to you?", "1486": "Broom would be a good choice, hit them in the crotch, that will stop them.", "1487": "That's sweet. I'm sure she will adjust in time. Have you ever personally had to make a move like your daughter did?", "1488": "No, I never have. I've always lived in my state I was born in. However, I did travel to Utah which was about 1200 miles away and got a bit homesick so I can relate.", "1489": "Oh no! I hate speaking in front of crowds. What happened?", "1490": "I know you probably feel like you did a bad job- but I bet you did so much better than you think! Be proud of yourself for having the nerve to speak in front of others!", "1491": "Honking is a way to communicate. In some countries they honk just to let another driver they are there.", "1492": "Going too slow can be just as dangerous as going too fast. Especially in the fast lane!", "1493": "That awesome! Congratulations! You should be very proud of yourself!", "1494": "Yes, I have! It's a great feeling when all of your hard work pays off! Best of luck to you!", "1495": "There is a big storm coming where I am living now. Did your power go out?", "1496": "Oh I will. Also wanted to let you know that if your power does go out to be aware that this is when they come out to play!", "1497": "I know!  I was just watching his show on Netflix!  So sad, especially since he had a little girl he is leaving behind.", "1498": "I agree.  He had so much to live for.  I guess it is hard to know what demons people are hiding inside.", "1499": "That is good. Did you have a good time with your supervisor?", "1500": "Good job! Maybe you will get a promotion too!", "1501": "Which way are you feeling? Are you a thrill seeker?", "1502": "Yeah I really like Six Flags. They have some great roller coasters. Have fun tomorrow!", "1503": "Keep it up. Soon you'll have enough money to buy a new house.", "1504": "Exactly, it feels great when your prepared for the unexpected.", "1505": "That's fun. Will anybody be dressing as Santa?", "1506": "Maybe you could pay someone to come into your house as Santa! And all the kiddies will be amazed!", "1507": "that happened to me one. i had an american bulldog that had seperation anxiety and tore up my sofa cushions once. it was like a fluffy murder scene when i got home.", "1508": "oh no. right now you are going crazy but it will be funny like you said in the future.", "1509": "What types of tv shows do you like to watch?", "1510": "Do you keep the tissue close whenever your are on the tv?", "1511": "Ive been to Busch Gardens before.  They have some really cool Roller coasters.  I hope you have a great time.", "1512": "Ive been to the one in Tampa.  They have this new coaster that rotates forward and backward and spins around. It was equal parts fun and scary.", "1513": "Yea, I agree. Or they just really don't care.", "1514": "Did he even hesitate?", "1515": "What a little monster!", "1516": "Dogs are the best. are they ok?  what kind of medicine do you have to give them?", "1517": "Awww golden retrievers are adorable.  My ex had one of them.  Well I hope your dogs feel better soon.  Ear infections are no fun at all.", "1518": "That's intense! I hope the damage wasn't all that bad.", "1519": "Yes, get it fixed as soon as possible. Does insurance cover it?", "1520": "Wow, you remember your friends from grade school? Maybe if I saw them again those memories would come back.", "1521": "Well, I hope you had a really great time. It sounds like you probably did!", "1522": "That sounds like fun, do you have a big family?", "1523": "Yes I understand, I have a big family so it's hard for us to all get together at the same time.", "1524": "Ive never been to one of those.  Is she really young or is she like a professional dancer?", "1525": "thats awesome.  I wish I would have taken dancing lessons when I was younger.  Im a horrible dancer", "1526": "yea you're right.  Maybe ill look into some classes and give it a shot", "1527": "Aw, that's so nice of him! Does he live far away?", "1528": "That's a great son. It's always nice to be able to rely on people close to you to help out when needed", "1529": "Yeah I have had that experience. One was so bad I left before getting another job. Don't recommend doing that, lol.", "1530": "Stick it out until you have a backup. Your bank account will thank you!", "1531": "Gross. It would have gone straight into the trash here.", "1532": "You can use baking soda to get the smell out of it.", "1533": "That sounds wonderful! What type of store is it?", "1534": "I love that! It must be so much fun to curate the types of things that go in to the store. Do you help out or work there?", "1535": "I'm sure she *loves* having both your presence and your support!", "1536": "Wow, I can't imagine how you felt living in Hong Kong. That would take some serious adapting.", "1537": "I am so happy that you found that expat community. I have often thought about moving abroad, and I'm glad that you adapted well.", "1538": "I think I might. It sound exciting, and I thank you for the encouragement.", "1539": "That's unfortunate, but I'm happy that you have a good support network to help you out.", "1540": "I hope you recover well and I'm sure you will with good support by your side.", "1541": "I completely understand that. Did something like that happen recently?", "1542": "Yes, I know how you feel. All we can do is encourage friends to join us in helping to make a difference. I believe there is hope!", "1543": "Wow, that's a good amount of time. Is he usually so secretive?", "1544": "Ah, maybe he just wanted to make sure it was going to work before he told anyone.", "1545": "It should be harder to get a license than it is.", "1546": "It's as if some people think they are the only one's on the road.", "1547": "Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry. May I ask how long ago it was that she passed?", "1548": "They probably still just need some time. My grandfather still isn't over the passing of my grandmother and that was over a year ago. I would just make sure to keep seeing and talking to your parents to make them feel as loved as you can.", "1549": "Please don't ever give up. I would definitely work harder to find a job by networking with friends that have jobs in different places.", "1550": "Go ahead and post your resume on as many job related forums that you can. I think it's great that you're trying to find other ways of making money too. You are a go-getter, and don't ever give up!!", "1551": "That is awesome. Do you know what she wants to study?", "1552": "As long as it is something she enjoys. I am sure you are very proud of her!", "1553": "it has been really busy even for me at work , i feel your pain", "1554": "I know right ? unfortunately for us those are the perks of growing up lol", "1555": "Oh I don't think I could do that. I have a fear of falling from high places.", "1556": "I think I would pass out from fear lol.", "1557": "I think the chances I take should be directly proportionate to the consequences of the actions.", "1558": "That is interesting. Do you miss meat or dairy at all?", "1559": "That is good to hear. I wish you the best of luck with your new diet.", "1560": "I have to trust my doc completely that he has steady hands and will inject the nerve correctly.", "1561": "That's terrible to hear. Were you eventually able to be there?", "1562": "That's great news. I don't know what I would do if my mom passed.", "1563": "Me too. I'm glad everytihng worked out in the end for you.", "1564": "Not very often. She lives about 7 hours away driving time.", "1565": "Those cars are pretty slick, what color was it?", "1566": "Wow, one day I hope to have enough money for a car like that, that's awesome", "1567": "UGH my dog has destroyed all of my favorite shoes.", "1568": "I dont really like dogs for that reason.  They are fun to pet but taking care of them is a chore.", "1569": "That sounds like you have a great wife.  What did she make you?", "1570": "Yummy, You are making me hungry.  Happy belated birthday!", "1571": "I always love pizza!", "1572": "when that happened to me i watched a lot of movies , for some reason the sad movies made me cry, but just be strong and patient one day you realize you can do better or find someone new", "1573": "it happens to the best of us, and i totally understand where your coming from , spend some time with your friends or loved ones", "1574": "What did he cook that is such an exciting way to spend your day with your papa.", "1575": "That sounds so delicious I would have loved a plate of that food any deserts", "1576": "Congratulations! Sounds like you're ready for the new position.", "1577": "What is your work area?", "1578": "That is so exciting! Such a fun time in life to watch them discover new things and always be such a surprise with what you didn't know that they already knew! ha ha, that's a tongue twister.", "1579": "I do!  An 8 year old daughter and 5 year old son.  They are my life as well so I totally get what you're saying.  How old is your daughter?", "1580": "Where are you going", "1581": "Oh wow, I hope you have fun", "1582": "Happy Birthday!!!!  Did you have a nice time?", "1583": "I love sushi.  Did you get a spicy Tuna Roll?", "1584": "Sounds good.  You have some generous parents.", "1585": "Very nice, wind in your hair, exercise, and fresh air.  Did you have a good time?", "1586": "I am actually home bound, but I love to live through other peoples experiences.  My wife and kids go out and bring back stories of their adventures.  I love it!", "1587": "I know how you feel.  I moved away from my family and friends this summer.  Do you have family nearby at all? I often feel lonely when I'm watching a movie by myself but then I remind myself that I'm loved by a lot of people.", "1588": "You are so strong!  Please thank your husband for his service and thank you for being his support, no matter the miles between you.  Take care of yourself and get out with friends when you can!", "1589": "You sound like you're embracing life!", "1590": "Where did you move to?  I feel you. I am in the same place.  Just reversed 13 years of Lupus suffering by going plant based and now I want to live and see the world! I would love to move to Italy.", "1591": "Oh wow, I'd be really jealous of him.", "1592": "Well, hopefully you can get yourself a better car soon.", "1593": "That is nice.", "1594": "I have one younger brother but he is old enough to drive on his own,", "1595": "Its always nice to catch up", "1596": "I hope you keep doing thaty", "1597": "Same here. I actually moved to the other side of the USA, and I do miss my home", "1598": "Not as often as I would like. Air travel is expensive after all. I know exactly what you mean though!", "1599": "Were you happy about that, or creeped out?", "1600": "You're a good guy. Did she take it well?", "1601": "That's really awesome that you supported your friend!", "1602": "I'm sure he really appreciated you support too!", "1603": "Aw, I'm sorry. I know this isn't the best solution, but have you considered listening to funny podcasts?", "1604": "No problem! I know you can't always fix everything, but it's worth trying wierd ideas every now and then", "1605": "Oh wow, I love that kind of sauce", "1606": "That isnt long at all", "1607": "It is always good to keep our skills up to date. We never know. It could also help for a promotion also.", "1608": "I hope you get your promotion.", "1609": "Oh man, your life is about to get so much more hectic. I feel for you. When my first was born, I was just as pumped, full of naivety and positivity. I felt like I could take on anything coming my way. I was exhausted after two weeks. It's such a long ride until they're able to even remotely look after themselves.", "1610": "I know you have a lot of work ahead of you, but I'm sure it will be a rewarding feeling that will be unmatched for the rest of your life. As a man, I can't imagine what you'll have to go through, or what you will enjoy, but I really commend all women everywhere for the strength they give when having a child.", "1611": "Did it scare you?", "1612": "Yes, a little bit. When I was young, I didn't like that much scary movies.", "1613": "Whats your favorite team?", "1614": "Well for me, in the NFL I like the Cowboys and college its Alabama too.", "1615": "That's pretty cool. I bet it's pretty difficult to do something like that.", "1616": "I'd love to watch people do tricks like this in person myself, but I'm not sure if there's any locations near me.", "1617": "Aw I am sorry that happened to you. I hope the repair didn't cost you too much!", "1618": "Ah I see. Something similar happened to my brother too recently while he was picking me up, so we were stuck at a coffee shop parking lot for several hours.", "1619": "Well at least you put in the effort. What grade did you end up receiving on this test?", "1620": "That's great! Hard work pays off I guess.", "1621": "Oh I'm sorry.  How are his family doing?", "1622": "It's pretty hard to deal with.  One of my friend's buddies died in a car crash as well.", "1623": "Woah, that is huge news. How are you handling the news.", "1624": "I am happy to hear that you will be ok. Enjoy having no kids while you can!", "1625": "That does not sound fun. What did you do to prepare.", "1626": "That is very smart thinking!", "1627": "How old were you? If you were a kid, that deserves a pass!", "1628": "You live and you learn, at least it was a petty crime and nothing serious!", "1629": "That's sweet of you, the flu is a pretty gnarly sickness to go through. You sound like a good friend!", "1630": "That's good, at least he is getting better, he'll survive!", "1631": "There's nothing wrong with that", "1632": "You should celebrate too. I would", "1633": "That is always disappointing. Did you have a good time with your friends anyway?", "1634": "Sounds like you guys know how to have fun no matter what. You have good friends.", "1635": "I too feel the same. What did happen at last?", "1636": "Yeah, very good to hear! congrats!", "1637": "Eww, I hate neighbors that have no class.", "1638": "Maybe you should start a petition in the neighborhood to kick her out.", "1639": "How awful! Please tell me you can laugh a little about it now?", "1640": "Embarrassing things happen to all of us!", "1641": "Amazing! I wish I could see a pic of it!", "1642": "Oh he will be, but enjoy it, only babies once", "1643": "that's a pretty long date! Where did you guys go?", "1644": "That sounds like a fun day! My wife and i used to go to movies a lot!", "1645": "That's terrible.  Was he already very sick?", "1646": "Im sorry he went through that.", "1647": "Those were the days right. I loved those paychecks no bills.... can we go back to that?", "1648": "Yeah and I bet it was like a whole 100 or 200 bucks and we were probably feeling like a ceo.", "1649": "How does that make you feel? Is that a dealbreaker", "1650": "Ah, I guess you have to save money somewhere", "1651": "Oh no I am sorry to hear about that, were you together long?", "1652": "That's good make yourself available and open for others and you will find the next relationship", "1653": "That is embarassing, but a good story at least!", "1654": "That is for sure, you can always count on parents for that", "1655": "IT does go fast. I was just changing my daughters diaper and now she is in junior high!", "1656": "I miss being called mommy. One day you'll be called grandma", "1657": "that is embarassing, but were you at least okay?", "1658": "Well maybe they found that endearing in a way!", "1659": "How old were you when you did it?", "1660": "That was nice to repay them back with dinner", "1661": "i'm sorry to hear that. i know exactly what you are going through. My brother tragically passed away 2.5 years ago. He was only 32", "1662": "I know how hard it was for you. My parents and my brother lived in a different country so i couldn't even go there at that time to be with them. I felt heartbroken and alone", "1663": "To thank whom?", "1664": "Is that who got you the job?", "1665": "What job do you have?", "1666": "Are you in a union?", "1667": "did you find it ?", "1668": "well thats good", "1669": "how old did you turn ?", "1670": "congrats", "1671": "When will you be able to visit?", "1672": "Oh boy, that must be amazing for him", "1673": "what did you end up watching instead", "1674": "thats cool", "1675": "Oh yeah, that's always nice. Sometimes they just don't get it, though.", "1676": "Wow, you sound pretty confident! You must really know what you're talking about.", "1677": "I am afraid to fly too.", "1678": "I know right, planes make me nervous.", "1679": "Uh oh. I bet she wasn't happy when she found out.", "1680": "Yeah, I can understand that.... But it probably would have been best to invite her anyway, just in case.", "1681": "that is awesome. sundays are usually my veg out days.", "1682": "mine is going crazy with mosquitos", "1683": "i tried to trim my tomato leaves yesterday but i got bit up so bad i ran back inside", "1684": "What does your husband do for work?", "1685": "My uncle use to be an iron worker, so I know exactly what you are talking about.", "1686": "That is VERY understandable. Emotional affair is still a betrayal.", "1687": "Well it's nice he is kind but yes that is a little strange. Women can usually take that as something and try to get with your man.", "1688": "What is her best talent?", "1689": "Does she draw or paint? How any students are in this program?", "1690": "That is terrible.  I don't know why teenage boys can be so mean.  What did you end up doing?", "1691": "That's good that she has a big brother that can defend her against the bigger kids.  It is just terrible that a teenage boy would act that way to a 10 year old.  No excuse for that.  I hope you don't have to deal with it again, though.", "1692": "I'm sorry, what is his job?", "1693": "Hopefully they will give him a better shift.", "1694": "Hey that's awesome!!!  What are you planning to buy with it?", "1695": "That's an awesome, very adult thing to do!  Congrats!", "1696": "I don't like them either. It makes me sick.", "1697": "Oh my gosh! That is disgusting!", "1698": "What does your husband do for a job?", "1699": "You already told me that. Is he in sales or something similar?", "1700": "that is no good! you need someone to be there and take care of you.", "1701": "I have never been married, so i cant imagine,  but I would want to be with my spouse every moment of every day.", "1702": "It is so hard and so rewarding to see them grow up.", "1703": "I bet.  I really want to hold on to mine forever, but I know that they need to grow up.  I hope you are still able to make memories with yours even as they are getting older.", "1704": "That is pretty scary. Did you find out where it came from?", "1705": "Smart move. You don't want to get involved in a gunfight. Glad you made it out safely.", "1706": "So sorry to hear that.. May i ask how did it happen?", "1707": "How sad.. Feel better knowing that he is in a better place now buddy", "1708": "Wow. Congratulations! Is your new job near home?", "1709": "Oh, that's awful. What did you do? I would've dumped her and beat that dude's face in.", "1710": "Well, I gave you the solution right there, buckaroo. All ya gotta do is execute.", "1711": "Oh nice. did you have a good time?", "1712": "Aww, that is really sweet to hear", "1713": "I don't have a normal job anymore but that would frustrate me as well.", "1714": "What a disgusting person. I'm just being honest.", "1715": "Oh the broadway musical? I heard really good reviews of it", "1716": "Oh yeah, he is such a true genius of our times, he deserves it", "1717": "Oh.. Were you sick?", "1718": "Don't feel bad about it buddy, this happens to all of us sometime. Feel better", "1719": "Oh dang. How do you think that is going to go down?", "1720": "I'm sure everything will be fine. Just gotta be yourself!", "1721": "Oh no.. That should have sucked for you. what did you do?", "1722": "As you should. It will pass away, dont worry", "1723": "I'm so sorry but what a joyous occasion.", "1724": "So happy for you. Is this your first grandchild?", "1725": "That sounds like a great place to propose! How did it go?", "1726": "That's so heartwarming! I hope your relationship works out very well!", "1727": "That is nice to have a friendly boss.", "1728": "I envy you. That is cool.", "1729": "Really?", "1730": "Yes I did that too", "1731": "This happened to me also.", "1732": "Did you try to exercise?", "1733": "That is so exciting!! buying a house can be such a great experience.", "1734": "Oh so it is brand new.  I bet you cant wait to move in.", "1735": "Really?", "1736": "So sorry about that", "1737": "I know how you feel. I'm working right now :(", "1738": "Can you blame her?   I mean, if i didn't have bills that's what I'd be doing.", "1739": "Isn't that the best!  My 3 year old the same thing!  I couldn't be happier or more proud!", "1740": "She may be a natural artist!", "1741": "I see.. did they complete them?", "1742": "Well, we were kids once too.. We can understand their point of view as well. Glad you got to spend quality time with them though", "1743": "Thats really cool! i hope you get one very soon buddy", "1744": "Yeah, i can understand how that can be frustrating. Dont worry, things will fall in its place soon enough", "1745": "awh memories, what were they of?", "1746": "so cute, i love those memories i bet it was beautiful.", "1747": "Why did he leave you?", "1748": "That's awful and there has to be another reason for it. I can't stand fathers who behave that way, despicable.", "1749": "Congratulations on getting an interview.  Good job in prepping for it, I'm sure you'll do well.", "1750": "What kind of job is it?", "1751": "Oh! Was the ice cream cake for you?", "1752": "Awww that is kind of disappointing. Ice cream cake sounds tastier than pineapple cake.", "1753": "Oh im so sorry to hear that.. how long were you married?", "1754": "It must have felt unbelievably hurtful for you.. I hope you find someone very soon..", "1755": "I can understand that. I don't get nearly as many birthday wishes as I used to. I guess it happens as we get older.", "1756": "I agree. I think they think we don't care about our birthday so they don't care either. But they are wrong.", "1757": "Oh! I am so happy for you. Congratulations. What was the job?", "1758": "That sounds very interesting. I'm sure you will do great.", "1759": "What happened??", "1760": "Holy moly! That would have scared me too! Did you kill it?", "1761": "That is understandable.  Such an experience can be tramatic.  Did you eventually learn?", "1762": "My wife had a similar experience, she still doesn't drive.  Good for you for overcoming it.", "1763": "That sounds miserable!  Did you do it yourself?", "1764": "At least you saved money doing it yourself!", "1765": "Oh wow! that stinks. Im sorry", "1766": "I bet it was. At least its over now", "1767": "I bet.  I was the same way.  How did you guys meet?", "1768": "Nice.  That's a relatively unique way to meet.  What store?", "1769": "I would be furious.  What did you do?", "1770": "What was the outcome?  Did the professor believe you?", "1771": "That's awesome!  What kind of house is it?", "1772": "That's gonna be a lot of fun, but a lot of work.  Good luck!", "1773": "that is exciting! what kind of car?", "1774": "wow, that is impressive. i've always liked mustangs. what color?", "1775": "I've had pets to do that too.", "1776": "Well, I guess it really loves you.", "1777": "I bet! Im sorry you are feeling down.", "1778": "Times like that would be so awesome! I hope they come back for you", "1779": "A spelling bee - what fun!

Are you excited to start or nervous?", "2713": "It's OK to be nervous, but don't let it stop you!  No risk, no reward!", "2714": "That sucks, I work with people like that and it's just more work for other people", "2715": "That's horrible, you should tell the boss and get her fired", "2716": "I bet it was.  Death is never an easy thing to deal with, especially for a child.", "2717": "I hope she will be alright!  I remember how devastated I was when my last dog passed away and I was an adult.  A kids emotions seem to amplify everything!", "2718": "You are lucky!", "2719": "how much did you win?", "2720": "I have never won that much. Congratulations", "2721": "Oh no! What happened?", "2722": "Oh geez, thats terrible!  Did they run from the scene?  Hopefully they left some information.

That is really crappy of someone! I have seen people put metal or wood pallets next to their mailboxes because of people doing stuff like this", "2728": "It's a good idea to have one just in case. Murders, robberies etc happen even in small/nice towns. Just for your safety", "2729": "That sounds nice.  Did you have a good time?", "2730": "That is a shame.  At least she made a stopover!", "2731": "What's the exam on?", "2732": "I wish you good luck!", "2733": "That's really cool! Was it your first game ever?", "2734": "Well I think it really cool that you were able to get back into something that you used to do when you were younger!", "2735": "That's so interesting because I saw someone post the same thing on a neighborhood app just today.

I think I'm overdue for one of those myself!", "2751": "That's great. It's nice when we get some peaceful time for ourselves.", "2752": "That is a big change!  Are you moving due to a job or something like that?", "2753": "Yes, that is definitely a big change.  I hope you settle in quickly though - change like that can be a drastic lifestyle upheaval, but it could also be the best thing ever!", "2754": "Nice. Do you like your new neighborhood?", "2755": "That is great. Why did you move?", "2756": "I'm not a fan of doctors most of the time - how did it go?", "2757": "I cannot stand that - they should not schedule people so close together if they can't handle that pace.", "2758": "Aww - did you feed the cat?", "2759": "That's how we have our cat also - how funny!  They are just irrestible at some point aren't they?", "2760": "Ugh!  I'm assuming that it woke you up?", "2761": "Oh my goodness!!  How irritating!  I hope they didn't call back?", "2762": "No way! Congrats! I'm having twins sometime this coming week", "2763": "That's nice! Kids are great", "2764": "I've always loved Halloween! Some people get crazy creative!", "2765": "That's awesome! Now that I have kids, I have even more of an excuse to go out and check out what creative ideas people have every year.", "2766": "Oh no!  I can't even imagine that - was everyone ok?", "2767": "I'm so glad that everyone was ok.  But I know that was devastating - did you rebuild?", "2768": "scary! how long were you lost for?", "2769": "oh good... I was imagining days", "2770": "Do you think she will be a good teacher for your daughter?", "2771": "A good teacher makes a huge difference in how well the child learns and how much influence the parents are allowed to have - I hope your daughter has a great year.", "2772": "I just cannot watch horror movies!!  Did you like it?", "2773": "Oh I am right there with you!  The last scary movie I watched made it where I couldn't sleep that night.", "2774": "Oh yeah?  Do you still look awesome like you did back then?", "2775": "Yeah I bet.  Do you still keep in touch with any of them?", "2776": "Yeah.  Maybe you should hit them up on FB for a reunion?", "2777": "I bet you all would live it up and have a blast!", "2778": "What did he want?  It's kinda scary when that happens, you never know what they want.", "2779": "Well a good samaritan after all!  I'm sure you were embarrassed, but also glad that you didn't lose your purse!", "2780": "Nice! What kind of car is it?", "2781": "Well deserved!

Large unexpected expenses are the worst", "2918": "Oh no! At least you have something to look forward to, the new house!", "2919": "Oh no! What a terrible thing to have happen! Were you able to confront them?", "2920": "That is just awful. Now you'll have to pay to have it repaired.", "2921": "Nice. Did you like it?", "2922": "That is nice.", "2923": "It was who,who were them?", "2924": "Ok,thats amusing", "2925": "Wow! thats great! I bet you feel proud of it!", "2926": "I bet you were full of joy and laughter yesterday!", "2927": "Oh no! Were you gone for long?", "2928": "What a bad doggie... hopefully they don't do it again", "2929": "I can hear the sigh of relief in your voice. I bet your anxious about what the next chapter will be.", "2930": "I can tell your proud of yourself. Im happy for you!", "2931": "You will be fine! Stay optimistic about it", "2932": "I agree, but having great joy in life helps", "2933": "It's good you're motivated! That's a step in the right direction", "2934": "I agree. I wish I could go back to school and pay more attention", "2935": "That's amazing and a very quick profit!  I'm a little bit jealous myself.", "2936": "It's amazing the effect something so seemingly small, like the company headquarters opening, can effect an entire town like that", "2937": "Yikes.  Did you get injured?", "2938": "Yeah and the lanes are really slick.  That's pretty funny and maybe a little embarassing too.", "2939": "I would be too! That's a really nice car for his first car!", "2940": "I do too. Maybe he will left you drive it!", "2941": "Wow you must be so happy! Nothing like a new car", "2942": "HAving a reliable car really changes things for the best", "2943": "Nice! What genre of playlist was it?", "2944": "Cool! I like to rediscover old playlists I made when I was younger.", "2945": "I can only imagine! How is he now?", "2946": "Doctor's are good at what they do! I hope for a speedy diagnosis and recovery!", "2947": "That is great news!  I bet you are glad to get a fresh start somewhere new.", "2948": "It is always exciting to move into a new place and make it your own", "2949": "oh , how he reacted next", "2950": "its ok it happens with every one", "2951": "Yes, that will be awesome! How long has it been since you've seen everyone?", "2952": "That's fantastic that you get to see everyone again! I hope you have a great time catching up.", "2953": "That is a great accomplishment. I admire your dedication in obtaining that goal.", "2954": "It's really hard to stick with something like that. I wish I could do it.", "2955": "That great to hear! Have you started a work out program before?", "2956": "You can do it! Don't forget to reward yourself for all of your hard work!", "2957": "Sounds impressive, does he mainly play for fun or is he in competitions?", "2958": "Very nice, I would be proud too.", "2959": "oh no what happened?", "2960": "that would really help if it was a permanent solution", "2961": "yeah enough is enough. i totally can't say i blame you.", "2962": "bwahaha not to mention it will help you get some relaxing sleep.", "2963": "I hate creepy stuff like that because I get paranoid.", "2964": "That sounds more odd than what I am used too. Hopefully nothing paranormal is going on.", "2965": "That will be an amazing trip!!", "2966": "That will be so great for them - I can just imagine meeting my granson for the first time - what a sweet time you are about to have.", "2967": "Christmas was always a nightmare for me.", "2968": "I cried every year knowing santa wasnt coming to my house.", "2969": "That is great! It's so awesome to feel confident after an interview!", "2970": "Yes it sure is. Did you end up getting the job?", "2971": "Was it a ghost?", "2972": "Oh,that was so hillarious", "2973": "That's great, keep it up if you can!", "2974": "It's good that you're being more proactive about your health now.", "2975": "Man, i wish i could get one.", "2976": "I also drive a chevy and have had it forever as well.", "2977": "Have you ever sold on Craigslist before? I always have the people meet me in the Walmart parking lot during the day. I have sold hundreds of things and have never had an issue like that.", "2978": "It will be okay. You could also have the people meet you at the local police station. The police do not mind and would rather you feel safe.", "2979": "Is it loud where you are now?  New places are always so fun!", "2980": "OH that will be such a huge relief I'm sure!  It's crazy that people behave that way, knowing they are causing other people such strife.", "2981": "Oh no! How did that happen and how much damage did they do?", "2982": "That is horrible! What will you do?", "2983": "That is truly all you can ask for.", "2984": "I try to never take anything in life for granted.", "2985": "Wow, impressive. You must have natural talent. Do you plan to make more?", "2986": "You can always sell them as well. I live in Amish country in PA and the Amish sell blankets for hundreds of dollars each.", "2987": "I bet! Is it hard to have a long distance relationship?", "2988": "I can only image how hard that was before the days of smartphones! I'm glad you were able to visit him!", "2989": "Aww. It's the things money can't buy that bring us the greatest joy, no?", "2990": "That is so true and it's a good perspective to have.", "2991": "Dogs really are such great companions, what breed is she?", "2992": "Yes I have a miniature pinscher, he just turned 15.", "2993": "how come? it will probably be an exciting adventure for you to start", "2994": "the summer is horrid. heat, sweat, mosquitos, rain, and crowds everywhere", "2995": "I do the same! I think everyone does.", "2996": "I think it's a normal human activity. You don't need to feel bad", "2997": "That's the way to do it!  Be prepared to kick it's butt and get good grades!", "2998": "Always put your school first, you will be thankful you did later!", "2999": "Whoa that's exciting!  What kind of car we looking at?", "3000": "That's a really good/safe first car.", "3001": "Thats awesome!  What kind of car do you want", "3002": "Well I really hope you are able to save up and get it soon!", "3003": "That's annoying, I hate how little attention most other drivers pay on the road.", "3004": "I'm glad that you are okay! Keep your eyes peeled for terrible drivers.", "3005": "I can imagine. How old will they be?", "3006": "Yeah but also just think of all the amazing movies she has done.", "3007": "Now that you what? Tell me!", "3008": "Oh that is great! I've heard that exercise can really help mentally and physically!", "3009": "That's great! Did you get anything you are especially excited about? It's a restaurant and a store?", "3010": "Dragon tongue beans! I've never heard of them! What do they look like?", "3011": "I will have to look for those. We have a huge variety of foods where I live, but this is new to me.", "3012": "It sounds amazing! Are the prices good?", "3013": "How did he scare you?", "3014": "I bet that gave you a good scare! Gotta love dads and step dads!", "3015": "Oh that sounds disgusting!", "3016": "I hope he gets that taken care of!", "3017": "I think we never really know what is going on inside people's mind. Celebrities like Anthony and Robin Williams seems to live a good life, but in reality, they are suffering.", "3018": "I completely agree! I think it would even help lower crime rates.", "3019": "All around, it would be a good decision for society. Just last night, I was watching Live PD and there was a young man stealing a candy bar. He was a drug addict. I believe if he had the help he needed, he would not have to steal tiny amounts of food.", "3020": "Oh no. I'm so sorry. Can you video chat with her?", "3021": "How wonderful. That's what's important and makes life meaningful in my opinion.", "3022": "Wow! That is insane, too bad you didn't bet with those kind of odds.", "3023": "That sounds like a great time, one of those nights you always remember!", "3024": "Yeah the older they get the more teachers they usually get. I think it's good because they get a variety.", "3025": "Yeah schools definitely start things younger now. Kindergarten used to be voluntary back in the day!", "3026": "I can understand that as I live in Florida and we prepare for hurricanes each year with a plan and emergency rations and supplies.", "3027": "Yes, you are correct. You can always hope for the best, but also plan for the worst. Being prepared is a comfortable feeling.", "3028": "That's wonderful, they say children have a certain gift for picking up languages.", "3029": "Wow! That's impressive and a lasting skill for your child to develop.", "3030": "Did you think about moving after that?", "3031": "haha are you serious? Did you move in with your girlfriend?", "3032": "Oh wow! I hope that it was ok!", "3033": "Oh no. That sounds really stressful!", "3034": "That is very unusual. She should be proud of herself.", "3035": "Wow, I wish more would follow her example. That's a recovery.", "3036": "I haven't watched actual TV in sooo long. What do you watch on Hulu?", "3037": "That's real neat, I might check it out. I've only ever used Netflix, but Netflix is pretty good too.", "3038": "Aw, I bet he feels horrible about it.  Poor kitty!", "3039": "Aw, that's always sad, I lost a cat once and I assume that's what happened to her ;(", "3040": "That would be horrific.  Do you know someone that this happened to?", "3041": "That is just horrible.  I think they would have to medicate me for the rest of my life if that happendd.", "3042": "That is nice of your friend. I hope you enjoyed it.", "3043": "You can return the favor one day. That is what friends are for!", "3044": "Do you have any idea where you will go? Is it accompanied?", "3045": "Well I hope they get there soon so you don't have to wait longer.", "3046": "I'm with you on this one.  What is up with people these days, I just don't understand how they could do that.", "3047": "I think there should be stiffer penalties for people that do things like that, for instance more jail time.", "3048": "i had a similar experience, i miss it too", "3049": "i totally agree", "3050": "I know that when just the 4 people in my family do go out, it runs us about $65.  So we do it very rarely, it wastes a lot of money.", "3051": "A week!?  That is just crazy, and pretty irresponsible unless you are a millionaire.", "3052": "Where to?", "3053": "I spent some time there, when I was learning how to be an Army Medic. I really enjoyed my time there!", "3054": "It's better to be safe than sorry. You can't overprepare.", "3055": "I am glad you didn't get hit. I know how stressful hurricanes can be.", "3056": "I bet! I hope you were able to catch up!", "3057": "You are very lucky!", "3058": "That's strange, I hope she makes it out ok this time though.", "3059": "Oh wow, I would never consider something like that hurting a dog.", "3060": "I'm sorry to hear that. I hope she passed peacefully.", "3061": "I am sure she appreciated your visit before her passing. She must have felt loved.", "3062": "That was a really smart call on your part! Were you worried?", "3063": "Well, it was a very smart thing you did packing those extra supplies.", "3064": "That sounds pretty stressful. Are you moving soon?", "3065": "That makes sense. I hate leaving things for the last second as well. Hopefully you won't have to leave everything boxed up for too long.", "3066": "That is great! You are lucky!", "3067": "It is a wonderful thing that you have someone to share your life with.", "3068": "Nice! Which ones did you hear!", "3069": "That one is a zinger! I remember listening to that when I took my grandma to prom!", "3070": "How did you do?", "3071": "Im sure you did fine. what was the subject?", "3072": "That is great! Can you call him and see if we could all celebrate together?", "3073": "Well yeah, that sounds about right. He has to go to the Championship first and win, then party time !!!!!", "3074": "It is really could to see friends live out their dreams! I will be cheering for him and the team!", "3075": "That's sound like a lot of fun! Do you know where I can go get lessons?", "3076": "I am in VA. I have been looking into it for quite awhile, but I think I'd be too chicken to jump out of the plane.", "3077": "Nothing wrong with that. I'm definitely with you on the organizational front. I bet they're not laughing when you get them out of a jam!", "3078": "It drives me nuts when people are disorganized. My husband is hopeless - I could throttle him sometimes!", "3079": "Oh man that is really annoying!  Have you found another one you like yet?", "3080": "Oh man I would be so upset.  I totally understand!  I hope you will be able to enjoy your new place", "3081": "Oh no! Do you know why?", "3082": "Aw, I'm sorry. I hope you get another horse that can at least help to replace that hole!", "3083": "Do you know he is coming, or is it just blind luck?", "3084": "That is very considerate of you, I bet he really appreciates that.", "3085": "Wow. That is quite an accomplishment! Congratulations!", "3086": "What was is your doctorate in?", "3087": "what has she been doing? undercover CIA agent?", "3088": "*wink* *wink*", "3089": "Ha, yeah gotta make sure the house is back up to wife code before she gets home... other wise there's going to be a price to pay.", "3090": "It always is, plus it gives you some brownie points as well.", "3091": "I am sorry to hear that, my wife has done the same thing. She wore a hat for almost a month when she left the house.", "3092": "Well, like I told her, it will grow out, it will just take time.", "3093": "That doesn't sound good. What happened that was so bad?", "3094": "That sounds like an awful experience. I probably wouldn't go back there anytime soon.", "3095": "Oh lord. Did you try to set it back up, or did you try to sneak away?", "3096": "Oh no, that's really embarrassing! Hopefully they let you off easy since it was just an accident.", "3097": "I know you're happy \ud83d\ude0a", "3098": "I feel ya, lonely indeed.", "3099": "That sucks. Why did you move from california?", "3100": "That's really common actually. There's a big exodus from there.  They voted for high taxes and now people are abandoning the state beacuse the cost of living is too high.", "3101": "The weather is nice in parts of california, I've been there.", "3102": "My sister got married at Laguna niguel", "3103": "That is a long trip.  Did you do it all in one go or did you take breaks?", "3104": "That's not bad, I was thinking you were doing it in like a couple days.", "3105": "Oh, poor lady. I do hope she's feeling better. What was wrong with her, if you don't mind my asking?", "3106": "Well, I'm really glad to hear she's recovered. Stomach bugs are awful - they really take their toll on you.", "3107": "Why was it boring, nothing exciting to do where you live?", "3108": "Ah yeah, that sucks. No time for anything fun.", "3109": "What kind of operation is it? I'm unfamiliar with weight loss surgery. But typically surgeries like that are very safe, but it is natural to feel nervous about someone you care about.", "3110": "Well, everyone is entitled to their own life choices. I'm sure she'll be alright.", "3111": "Yeah, that's never fun. Did you lose at something recently?", "3112": "I agree, it makes you just want to try harder next time.", "3113": "That's great, what specifically has made it so good for you?", "3114": "Wow that all sounds very exciting, congratulations!", "3115": "thats so sad oh no! thats terrible. :(", "3116": "They are honestly just like children so its really sad.", "3117": "Awww, I totally know that feeling. I hate even going on vacation and not being able to bring my dog along. She is family!", "3118": "I can imagine! Is he doing okay?", "3119": "It must have been! Have you guys been apart before?", "3120": "Ah so you've gone through it a couple of months alrready. How much longer is she going to be away for?", "3121": "You must be so thankful!", "3122": "They are really wonderful. Do you have plans to show how thankful you are?", "3123": "When will you be going ?", "3124": "Wow, I hope you have a really nice trip.", "3125": "just cause of the way they look or you had an incident involving one?", "3126": "yea im right there with you on that one along with snakes heh", "3127": "That sounds like a pleasant surprise!", "3128": "Thats so sweet of her and what a great memory to have!", "3129": "That's a terrible waste of food, how old is your little brother?", "3130": "Well, I hope he soon sees that is not something that he should be doing.", "3131": "That's brutal, did she get out?", "3132": "Did she have insurance?", "3133": "Awful! did you complaint?", "3134": "Food should be made hygiene. We shouldn't compromise on health.", "3135": "That's annoying, was it garlic bread?", "3136": "What did you say to him after he did it?", "3137": "How so?", "3138": "That's awesome!  I love getting surprises!", "3139": "That's so sad.  I've lost dogs before.  I know how you feel :(", "3140": "Yeah dogs are man's best friend.", "3141": "Yes I've got one.  She's a stray that showed up to work one day.", "3142": "She's been a great dog. I've got no complaints or regrets.", "3143": "Oh wow haha that's not good", "3144": "That's an interesting combination, maybe you should try to keep him out of the kitchen", "3145": "What grade is he in?", "3146": "Awesome! That had to be a great confidence boost for him!", "3147": "That's amazing! How long have you been running?", "3148": "That's pretty cool. I hope you win!", "3149": "I'm right there with you.. I still feel pretty introverted, but since coming to college, I've been forced to socialize more, and it's help me at least fake it until I make it. I still prefer to be alone a lot of the time, but at least I can somewhat manage without making myself look dumb. Maybe you can just think of some topics/things to talk about to have in the back of your head for the times when things get quiet?", "3150": "I hope it goes well! If it makes you feel any better, most of them are probably just as nervous and are looking for any excuse to relax and let their guard down, too. Good luck", "3151": "That sounds awesome. Have you ever been before?", "3152": "I wish I could go sometime that sounds like quite the experience.", "3153": "How'd it turn out? Congrats on deciding to lead a healthier life, by the way.", "3154": "I'm the exact same way in the gym. Music is a huge motivator for me. One time my phone died while in the gym and the rest of the workout was so low energy.", "3155": "Yeah I have, it wasn't serious but I got rearended", "3156": "That's terrifying, I'm so glad you're okay", "3157": "That is very sad. Did something recently happen to her?", "3158": "That is absolutely horrible. I hope she has a moment of happiness very soon. No one should have to deal with that much loss.", "3159": "Death by a thousand cuts, I call it! They'll try to make a buck off anything!", "3160": "Did you try talking to them about it? I can only assume it wouldn't go well but you never know.", "3161": "Yes, I have.  One that actually died and one that was miraculously saved.  It was a dark and tough time.  Did that happen to you recently?", "3162": "I am soo soo very sorry.  Its so hard to understand everything surrounding a suicide so its hard to be at peace about something that didn't have to happen.  I pray you and your family will find closure and fight for awareness for people who are struggling with those feelings.", "3163": "Yeah, I have. Do you?", "3164": "It happens. Hope your dog will poop outside soon.", "3165": "Always sucks when you forget to save it and wake up to a melted blob of brown.", "3166": "Oh wow! I HATE when you get the urge to eat something and then you get to the fridge only to realize it's gone. Do you know who ate it?", "3167": "Thats horrible! You should tell them as that is their property. What if someone did that to your stuff?", "3168": "GOOD on you!!", "3169": "I know how you feel, financial problems are rough. I know you'll figure out a way to make it.", "3170": "That really stinks! Don't worry too much though, things will work out.", "3171": "That's awesome, what was in it?", "3172": "You must be happy to have it back, those are the best memories.", "3173": "Ugh! I hate it when stuff like that happens. Were you able to get a refund on your tickets?", "3174": "Awesome!!", "3175": "That is very true! Was it bad weather?", "3176": "i hate that too, what were you going to do?", "3177": "Maybe I could come with you, I'm near Florida.", "3178": "Why don't you believe him? He made have been quite the big name back in his day.", "3179": "Wow, that sounds amazing. I wish I could have seen that!", "3180": "That sounds interesting.  What kinds?", "3181": "Oh that's awful!", "3182": "Is that like the child equivalent of under the bed?", "3183": "That's kinda strange. I assume that's something he'll grow out of.  How old is he?", "3184": "Wow, that took some guts! What made you want to cut it?", "3185": "And just think about how much you're saving on shampoo and conditioner!", "3186": "Ahhhh! I've done that before, but I noticed it quick.  Did you not know til the end of the day?", "3187": "That's embarrassing, ah, I'm sorry.  Just play it off tomorrow at work!", "3188": "Please tell me it was not full of Oriental Trading Company rubber ducks and cheap tchotchkes.", "3189": "Oh man! I feel bad for laughing but literal garbage is pretty funny. That sucks, can you report them to eBay?", "3190": "How did you do?", "3191": "That's good. I was never good at chemistry", "3192": "I understand, anything you need to talk about?", "3193": "Buck up little camper.", "3194": "How is she doing", "3195": "I am happy for you and her", "3196": "i can't believe christmas is in 4 months it's crazy", "3197": "mine is the fall. halloween, thanksgiving....what's not to love.", "3198": "well the casino won! did you at least get some free drinks?", "3199": "hah.. at least you had fun it sounds like", "3200": "I do hate when the lights are off too", "3201": "I am sure I would too. Just be careful", "3202": "I am happy for you. Are you excited?", "3203": "I bet you will be fine. Just be yourself", "3204": "Are you ready for it?", "3205": "I am sure you will do well", "3206": "That must be annoying for you, but I love cats.", "3207": "What is his name?", "3208": "Oh that's great! Congratulations on your upcoming finish!", "3209": "That's amazing. I wish you the best of luck with the remaining classes!", "3210": "Ohh what happened?", "3211": "Sometimes things like these happens. Don't worry. But playing hookey is a fun though", "3212": "I know exactly what you mean.  It gets so lonely on the road.  Have you had to go away recently?", "3213": "That's still quite a long ride.  Do you do a lot of long distance biking?", "3214": "on to the next one, as they say!", "3215": "have the new chick there when she comes home", "3216": "Oh yeah.  I've never seen it, I can't watch horror films.  How did you like it?", "3217": "Ohhh boy.  I hope you have a person or an animal to snuggle up to to help you feel better.", "3218": "That's scary when that happens", "3219": "Some people DO die from choking, be safe!", "3220": "Why is that?", "3221": "Oh that makes sense, well be careful", "3222": "Whoa, that is scary! Did you know him?", "3223": "I am glad that you are okay!", "3224": "Hahaha, sounds kind of like clickbait", "3225": "Hahahaha, that's so funny", "3226": "That is weird but amazing! Does it work?  If it does, I will get my husband to tape his mouth shut.  He snores like a freight train because his tongue slides back I guess.  Is that true for you?", "3227": "Do you have any advice on what kind of tape?", "3228": "That sounds like a nice time!", "3229": "Wow that worked out perfectly", "3230": "Did you go over and ask them to turn down the volume?", "3231": "Well, I hope you have some really good earphones - or that they quiet down - it's a big egotistical to think that no one around you cares when you are that loud.", "3232": "I know what you mean. Once I had a bank where the teller's literally had butts for heads. It was so distracting trying to talk to them.", "3233": "Well it was an upgrade from the bank I had where the tellers were actually robots. I can't believe the cost-cutting measures in place today!", "3234": "wow  thats nostalgic!!. It must have brought back lot of good memories", "3235": "does the machine is in good condition now?", "3236": "What happened?", "3237": "Are they going to pull the tooth?", "3238": "Thats not strange at all", "3239": "That sucks. What did you do?", "3240": "Oh no, the poor girl. Was she able to walk afterwards?", "3241": "You're a terrific partner. You guys can do something outdoors next time, right?", "3242": "hahaha why was it underwhelming?", "3243": "lol how do you feel about spiders?", "3244": "Why were you getting mad?  Were you not lifting as much as you wanted?", "3245": "I see,  I do that too sometimes.  It helps with motivation", "3246": "You are good at generalizing aren't you?", "3247": "I have no clue.. really I don't!", "3248": "how much did you win?", "3249": "Thats sounds like a fun trip or 8", "3250": "that sounds cool.", "3251": "Wow. I would love to see something like that", "3252": "What did you name her?", "3253": "Thats so cute!", "3254": "Oh you must have enjoyed it!!", "3255": "Yeah indeed it must have been then", "3256": "So cute! What kind of dog is it?", "3257": "That's amazing, I wish I could get a puppy too, but my cat is not friendly", "3258": "That's crazy did you ever get it back?", "3259": "I am so sorry maybe you will have better luck next time.", "3260": "Eww, it may be time to call someone to take care of them.", "3261": "Oh, that had to be super gross!", "3262": "How creepy!", "3263": "At least nothing happened to yo", "3264": "That's rough. Did you end up getting the job?", "3265": "Well, there's always next time. At least you can chalk it up as a learning experience.", "3266": "That's strange. What did you discover under there?", "3267": "Oh my! That is repulsive indeed! I would've taken it home for dinner. Waste not want not!", "3268": "Oh NO!  Are you okay?", "3269": "Yeah I bet!  Did they stop and check on you?", "3270": "Oh yeah? Is it on par with I Have a Dream?", "3271": "Woah now! I wasn't thinking of a speech on that grand of a scale! I hope you blow Gimli's beard clean off his face and make 20 horns of Gondor sound!", "3272": "wow that was really nice of them", "3273": "Most people now a days won't do that. Make sure to pay it forward!", "3274": "That's great, man! Did you study hard for it?", "3275": "Well, that's all that matters! Just gotta pass those exams!", "3276": "Aw, that's awesome, did it bring back memories?", "3277": "Yeah, it's always nice to take a look back and reflect on the early days.", "3278": "Nice! Who did you go see? Did you catch a homerun?", "3279": "That sounds amazing. All I have is my lowly Senators sea level stadium...I am mad jealous.", "3280": "Oh dang. Was she a hoarder? What did you find?", "3281": "I can't even imagine the stench...did you make out with any buried treasure?", "3282": "Oh that's terrible.  Is he alright?", "3283": "That really stinks that that happens.  Are you pretty upset about it?", "3284": "I do love a smooth ride. What kind of car is it?", "3285": "That's awesome! I am mad jealous that you have my dream car!", "3286": "Wow, you were dedicated, did you do well on it?", "3287": "Congratulations, all the hard work paid off!", "3288": "That must of been pretty stressful. But did you get enough sleep?", "3289": "Sleep is just as important as studying hard. You can kill your performance without it.", "3290": "That's terrible! Did you get it back with everything still inside?", "3291": "At least you have a happy ending for that story.", "3292": "I agree. I think I am one of them, considering I gave my whole life savings to charity yesterday.", "3293": "That's really great, but I swear it was true! It was a whole 50 cents. Looking back on it, I am kinda sad I did it because now I can't buy that fancy fidget spinner at the supermarket. Hopefully some orphan uses it wisely.", "3294": "That's good to hear, what did she do to make you proud?", "3295": "Oh wow! That's amazing, i'm sure that was a really touching moment!", "3296": "Sorry to hear that. Maybe you can talk with your boss about changing the schedule a bit.", "3297": "Wow, that is a long time! That shows how dedicated you are to your job, and that you deserve some time off!", "3298": "That is awesome.  What are you hoping to do?", "3299": "That's the dream, to get paid in college.  I wish I could have done that.  Congratulations!", "3300": "Are you cleaning out a house or do you not have garbage pick-up?", "3301": "That is insane! I've never heard of anything like that before.  You all should start protesting!", "3302": "Oh really? What was it they served?", "3303": "Oh wow... I really can't imagine eating it knowing it had those in it.", "3304": "I hope she hears some good news. Is it pretty serious?", "3305": "I'll be praying for her, I hope she continues to stay in the clear in the future.", "3306": "Oh no, it's awful something happens on that special day that should be full of joy and whatnot.", "3307": "Yikes. Well, at least you did the right thing by passing that long, as painful as it might have been.", "3308": "am sorry about that, what are others doing about it", "3309": "sorry, just tryy to be patient with them", "3310": "Old school video games are full nostalgic memories for me. That is why i try to avoid them as they evoke many emotions in me", "3311": "It is just that I miss my friends a lot with whom i used to play. I wish i could just rewind time and go back", "3312": "I love beer! I wish I could try your guy's beer.  Is it a hard process?", "3313": "Awesome, that's great news!  Hope you guys make a great tasting one and become big!", "3314": "ooh, you should not be, she should be appreciated for looking good", "3315": "aha, thats funny though", "3316": "Oh, I haven't read it, but I was also sad to hear he passed", "3317": "Yes, too bad he was struggling with his depression and couldn't seek help", "3318": "Aw, that's so nice of them! Was it fun?", "3319": "That's great! It's so nice that you have people around you who care", "3320": "Ohhh..I would love that experience! How special!", "3321": "I love that too! I try feeding everyone :) Awesome!", "3322": "Oh geez! Why was she gone for so long?", "3323": "That's pretty cool! That would be hard though! Were you all able to talk a lot?", "3324": "How long have you been there ?", "3325": "Sometimes we affect people that we don't realize.", "3326": "That doesn't seem fair. How are they getting around not paying you for it?", "3327": "It sounds like your boss needs to be more considerate when it comes to his employees.", "3328": "Wow, did you ever get them in trouble?", "3329": "There you go, take victories where you can get them!", "3330": "Great, what is his field ?", "3331": "I see. I hope for all the best for you and him.", "3332": "Sounds super relaxing! I bet your enjoying it!", "3333": "Thats awesome! What kind of soup do you make?", "3334": "My brother just graduated and is on the job hunt, and he's described his experience as the same thing.. Seems like he has good interviews and they're receptive to him, but they don't really respond or give him an answer. Sorry to hear you guys go through that. Can't imagine how frustrating it is", "3335": "Good on you for being aggressive and opportunistic. Maybe they found that to be the motivating factor to give you the job. I hope it's been good so far.", "3336": "That sounds like so much fun!", "3337": "I totally get why you feel that way.  Your time will come soon.", "3338": "I hope you can recover soon!", "3339": "That's good! I bet you missed her a lot.", "3340": "I'm sure she'll have a lot to tell you about her trip!", "3341": "That's a long time to kind of hang in limbo. I am sorry you had to endure that for a month.", "3342": "Well, at least that story had a happy ending. It could have went much worse.", "3343": "Aw, I bet you miss her a lot.", "3344": "Well, at least the dogs still have you for company. I'm sure you'll be happy when she gets back though.", "3345": "What kind of job is it?", "3346": "Interesting! What kind of things do you do?", "3347": "aw man that sucks how come he gets to get one but not you", "3348": "well after a certain age parent's start to treat children differently lol", "3349": "when does she return?", "3350": "well thats good", "3351": "Did you go running like crazy!?", "3352": "i would have done the same glad no one got stung!", "3353": "They are bad now too, they are so annoying", "3354": "It can be irritating to deal with this time of year", "3355": "Come on, the worst that can happen is that it kills you.", "3356": "It's certainly a good enough reason to kill them.", "3357": "Wow, are you nervous at all", "3358": "That's exciting. I'd never have the guts to do it so kudos to you.", "3359": "That kind of stinks. Sorry to hear that! Well, at least there are worst things to forget outside.. Maybe this is an easy learning lesson!", "3360": "I didn't even think of that! That's one thing about tea with me, that I've never gotten into it because you get it and it's so hot, so you have to wait forever to drink it. You set it down and then ultimately forget it!", "3361": "Yikes that sounds scary but overall good for the end results. How do you feel about it?", "3362": "I understand i would be too but now a days technology is really good just make sure its a reliable hospital!", "3363": "That's a good friend you got there.", "3364": "Never take someone like that for granted. They are so rare.", "3365": "What types of situations are you referring to?", "3366": "lol, did everyone around you make funny faces?", "3367": "I am so sorry to hear that. Was she able to go surrounded by you guys?", "3368": "It's hard to lose a family member like that. You guys should take some time to grieve.", "3369": "Where did they go?", "3370": "That sounds like so much fun!", "3371": "That's great!  I've got to deal with loud neighbors too.  Anything specific they do?", "3372": "Loud running toddler who pitches fits at random times, day or night.  Sounds like a similar level of noise :P", "3373": "Oh wow, I bet you can't wait! I remember when I had to spend a summer overseas and it was awful to be away from my husband.", "3374": "Well, she'll be back soon and you'll have loads of catching up to do. I bet the dogs missed her too!", "3375": "Could you elaborate as to why?", "3376": "Oh no could you call an exterminator?", "3377": "I'm sure you'll do great!  How long have you been training?", "3378": "Wow, that's a lot of dedication!  I believe in you!", "3379": "i can imagine, i have been there and it is the worst just belive in yourself", "3380": "yeah it always gets bbbetter that is the good thing", "3381": "That sounds like fun! I've always wanted to visit India.", "3382": "Nice. I hope you have a great time!", "3383": "That sounds like a relief.", "3384": "It seems like it's a lot of ruckus, I've visited friends who have your situation and I can only imagine.", "3385": "Glad you enjoyed that short period of peace. Maybe soon you will get new neighbors or you can get a better place.", "3386": "Oh, good. I'm sure it will be an improvement from your current situation.", "3387": "Omg i would have been so embarrassed! :O", "3388": "thats true imagine if you had! it takes a lot of talent tho to put your pants on inside out and still manage to button them. ha ha", "3389": "that is awesome, i hope that happens to me on my next trip, where where you going", "3390": "well you are really lucky to have an empty airport", "3391": "I would go mad, were you away at college or in the service?", "3392": "That is great, I am sure he misses you and will be so happy to see you. He will smell you coming and know your there even before you get in the door.", "3393": "That's not silly at all! I'm sure he'll love it.", "3394": "Yeah, he'll be all grown up before you know it!", "3395": "Did it turn out how you expected it", "3396": "I'm glad to hear... Weddings can be stressful", "3397": "Maybe put the poop back on your neighbors yard?", "3398": "Its the only way to get them to learn", "3399": "That's wonderful, it's always good when hard work pays off like that!", "3400": "I bet so that sounds nice", "3401": "Oh wow, that sounds like it was a big mess.", "3402": "I hope she didn't eat too much of it, it might make her sick.", "3403": "Oh yeah? Did you go give it a try?", "3404": "That's a shame. I hate it when a place doesn't live up to the hype.", "3405": "That can be a bit uncomfortable for sure. Did you try and avoid conversations", "3406": "If it gets to be too much be sure to walk away.", "3407": "He must be really strong!", "3408": "Sure,  I strong men is very attractive! You must be proud of him!", "3409": "That is hard thing to go through. I hope you are feeling better about it now.", "3410": "I bet. Losing a pet is much like losing a loved one. It gets better but still hurts sometime.", "3411": "Aw, that sucks. But at least he got a job, right?", "3412": "Well, hopefully he can schedule another time to come visit you.", "3413": "Oh my. That is very unfortunate.", "3414": "I know that feeling. Im sure she is looking down on you all.", "3415": "That must have been a little bit of a roller coaster. That's kind of why I'm not wild about cats, is because they're so independent, and the outside cats can just go hang out somewhere for days and not have a care in the world about you. But I guess that suits some people.", "3416": "Oh man.. so that was REALLY a roller coaster then. I'm so sorry.. I hope you're not overwhelming yourself with guilt about it. It sounds like something you could not have any control over.", "3417": "My nephew is getting into golf! It seems like a cool enough sport, albeit a little expensive. I hope you're able to get back to playing again. I've taken up running and swimming, and it's interesting how much those physical activities relieve stress in our day.", "3418": "Well, often people just give up and relegate themselves to just sitting in a chair and watching TV. Even if you have to force yourself, at least you are forcing yourself. At some point hopefully you will see progress and feel it getting easier. Once that happens, motivation starts to become real easy to get.", "3419": "I've never been skydiving myself. I hear that it's a great experience, but I'm not sure if I have the bravery for it.", "3420": "Oh wow. Is it something that you would do again?", "3421": "Sounds like fund, you must be excited!", "3422": "I think I will need to do that, my TV is an oldy.  I am sure you will have a great time.", "3423": "That sounds horrible. I would not have been able to sleep after that.", "3424": "How terrifying. I hope you were able to find and kill it.", "3425": "Well, it's okay to be a bit nervous. Interviewers will understand that. You only have to halfway reign in it in and you'll hit that happy medium that's good for a workplace interview. Where are you applying to?", "3426": "I bet you have a good shot at it! Good luck", "3427": "Did you tell anyone about the dream?", "3428": "You should call your best friend on the telephone!", "3429": "That is sure to make you feel the nostalgic?", "3430": "oh that sounds like fun", "3431": "sounds like a wonderful day!", "3432": "Oh My!! What are you going to do? I would buy it anyway.", "3433": "Well thats unfortunate. Hopefully you will be able to buy it soon.", "3434": "It happens to the best of us. It would be great if they did not make us gain weight.", "3435": "Well you have to live a little every now and then. I'm sure it was worth it, haha.", "3436": "Oh no, poor baby", "3437": "Yes cuddles will help", "3438": "That sounds really fun. Can you still remember some of the routines?", "3439": "Yea that is a long time. You should reach out to some and see if they are on social media.", "3440": "I'm fascinated by how people can watch golf, I always found it really boring, but if you enjoy it then great!", "3441": "Oh that totally changes things I guess, makes sense.", "3442": "Aw that's terrible, at least you were able to comfort her?", "3443": "I'm sure you were! Those people deserved some confrontation for sure.", "3444": "Oh my god! what did you do? did you tell anyone?", "3445": "LOLOLOL the cops probably had a good laugh about that.", "3446": "Me too!!! ii never could understand what drives people to be so mean to such innocent creatures.", "3447": "Really!! I would go even further and give them the electric chair. I have no tolerance for those types of people.", "3448": "Oh, I hate it when that happens. Did you find out what it was?", "3449": "I'm glad it wasn't something dangerous. That would be a terrifying experience.", "3450": "You do? thats good, friends can be terrible people to lend too.", "3451": "I bet he pays you in full.", "3452": "I bet that was scary. Did he surprise you with something?", "3453": "Ahhh. How nice. You are lucky to have such a thoughtful husband.", "3454": "Does it look like a space ship?", "3455": "I have never seen a drone flying around here. Even in the day time", "3456": "What does she do?", "3457": "Wow, I would just tell her its private. Sounds annoying", "3458": "Aw I understand that, I have gone through that myself and it's very hard. When did this happen?", "3459": "Oh no I'm very sorry. What kind of pet?", "3460": "Oh no, have you been able to calm yourself down?", "3461": "I can understand that, I think I would be a mess too.", "3462": "That does not sound plpeasant at all, maybe they should relocate those who are staying there.", "3463": "Hopefully no one was injured at all from the accident?", "3464": "I bet you are, that's some pretty good foresight right there! Did you have to use it this past winter?", "3465": "How satisfying must it be to have something like that ready to go in case of emergency, and then to actually get to use it? I'm pretty jealous, and proud in a vicarious kind of way.", "3466": "Well good luck with that!", "3467": "What are you studying?", "3468": "Do roller coasters scare you", "3469": "I used to be afriad of heights too", "3470": "That's a bummer. Maybe next time you can join them.", "3471": "Sound like a Netflix weekend then. Hope you got a lot of work done.", "3472": "Goodness, you're right about that. Plus a pet is the only thing to show unconditional and neverending love for you.", "3473": "I'm so very sorry for your loss, I can only imagine that pain. I had to put my girl down 3 years ago and I promise that it does get easier.", "3474": "It's the worst waiting for vacations! You want the time before to go fast but then it to go slow during. Never works out that way, unfortunately.", "3475": "That's great! I'm glad you had a good time. I've never been on a cruise before but it sounds like I need to try one out!", "3476": "And how is she doing now", "3477": "That is awesome.  Sometimes a second opinion is all you need", "3478": "aww that's too bad.  I hope you got some solid netflix in at least!", "3479": "bummer.  Well I hope you get a chance to do that soon!", "3480": "Oh that sounds fun!", "3481": "That isn't good at all, glad you didn't have an accident.", "3482": "Did you find any good companies.", "3483": "Did you have alot of accidents that can jack your rates up.", "3484": "It's okay! Try to rest on the couch and that might help!", "3485": "I know that feeling all too well. But don't get down on it, just try better tomorrow.", "3486": "That must have been scary.  Is that the first time it has happened to you?", "3487": "Are you able to do anything to prevent them?", "3488": "I'm sure that he will turn up soon. I really hope that you find him.", "3489": "Maybe check your local animal shelters? Sometimes they are taken there by people who find them.", "3490": "Aww, I'm sorry to hear that.  Was it a bad break up or did you part on good terms?", "3491": "That's really odd.  I wonder why they didn't have the courtesy to let you know that they'd lost interest or whatever the case may be.  To just cut off contact seems a little rude.", "3492": "How thoughtful.  Now you have to pay it forward, as the saying goes.", "3493": "Kindness is infectious.", "3494": "How exciting, is he a non-traditional student?", "3495": "That is really good, speaking from experience, all military men and women should get a degree.", "3496": "Why? What happened? I hope you didn't get food posioning.", "3497": "Oh gosh, that is gross! Maybe tell the manager so he can make it right, and make sure his staff is doing things to health codes!", "3498": "Oh no! I hope you did not burn yourself.", "3499": "Hopefully you were wearing dark clothing, coffee on light colors stinks!", "3500": "Oh no! What happened?", "3501": "Oh man! I would have been so scared!", "3502": "Ugh that's so annoying. What are they even barking at?", "3503": "Yeah, that would drive me crazy. Sounds like the neighbor needs to control their dogs.", "3504": "I do that all the time, no big deal.", "3505": "What kind of pizza did you eat?", "3506": "That is such a relief, it is so nice to have money saved up in the bank.", "3507": "Oh yeah, retirement will come before you know it, it is good to be prepared!", "3508": "Oh wow, now that really is exciting, congratulations! Did you get the grade level and subject you wanted?", "3509": "Teaching little humans will be such a joy. I really hope you enjoy it!", "3510": "That sucks, will she not let you see the dog at all?", "3511": "Yes, that is probably a positive.", "3512": "Yeah it really does. It's even worse to try and close those accounts!", "3513": "Man that sounds really stressful...", "3514": "oh that is awesome. what does she do?", "3515": "that is great. my sister is an account too. she's also the office manager.", "3516": "Congrats to your friend! That is an amazing accomplishment.", "3517": "I would be proud of her too! Hopefully her success continues. You sound like a good friend!", "3518": "don't be. i'm sure you raised him right. he will be starting his new adventure", "3519": "i'm sure he's cool as a cucumber while you are a nervous wreck. it will be fine.", "3520": "it will be find. have a little fiath in him and you will see", "3521": "it's very exciting. i wish you both all the best.", "3522": "I remember that console, that's old school.", "3523": "Those were the good old days!", "3524": "are you able to get some tutoring or find a study buddy?", "3525": "thats good.. well you are on your way up!", "3526": "Thats awesome, can we trade?", "3527": "That is a really good idea. He must be thoughtful to have cooked dinner for you and had it ready, unlike mine", "3528": "that is very true", "3529": "hopefully its better tomorrow!", "3530": "Hmm, that's interesting tell me more about what that number means to you.", "3531": "Really, my friend had a tarantula as a pet when she was five, scared the poop out of me", "3532": "Are you really able to work from home? Finding a gig is so difficult, I'm glad that it is working for you.", "3533": "5", "3534": "That is fantastic. Any good new lately?", "3535": "That is an amazing feeling.", "3536": "did you go to the doctor", "3537": "yuk for sure", "3538": "Well, did you eat her ice cream?", "3539": "I wonder who actually ate it then.", "3540": "So are you saying it could be the guy?", "3541": "You will be fine. Its going to be hard but dont beat yourself up over it.", "3542": "Then it sounds like you are already ahead of most new fathers.", "3543": "That would be pretty cool to see, but you should know that typically most cats swish their tail when they're annoyed or angry! It didn't attack you, did it?", "3544": "Ahh, okay. Yeah I don't know. It might have also been scared or feeling like it had to protect it's turf. But still, that's neat to see and not an everyday thing!", "3545": "Nice, I guess the only times I was nervous to take a test was when I wasn't prepared, but there's only so much preparation you can do until you just have to trust your brain or whatever", "3546": "Wow! You must have like every technique in your toolbox to go for that goal", "3547": "i bet it does bud, I know the feeling. So how do you deal with it", "3548": "yes i know, good memories do help. every relation is a new chapter in the book called our life.", "3549": "sometimes they cant avoid it", "3550": "ok", "3551": "I cant imagine how scared you must have been.", "3552": "Not sure. You must be very confused. Did you crash?", "3553": "Oh god. Was it big?", "3554": "Well, maybe look at its lifespan? Maybe it'll die if you end up not finding it.", "3555": "what does she draw", "3556": "thats awesome", "3557": "Kayla sounds wonderful! How long have you guys been friends?", "3558": "Finding someone like that is rare. Take good care of that one!", "3559": "I am sorry to hear that. How far along is it?", "3560": "Keep a positive attitude. I will be thinking of you!", "3561": "Did you find out what happened?", "3562": "Man. That must've been really nerve wrecking. Did you get any sleep?", "3563": "did it turn out ok ?", "3564": "hopes he continues to get better", "3565": "I'm so sorry!  Don't lose hope though. I know some science based nutrition that helps you overcome and kill it going high nutrition plant based vegan.  Look up Dr. Joel Furhman.  It'll save you from all the meds that hurt your body.", "3566": "I know it must be overwhelming you but coming from someone that is fighting chronic epstein barr virus and Lupus, it will change your life.  Check out HIV and going vegan on youtube and thebody,com and so many other resources.  You might be able to reverse it and it wouldn't even be a concern for having kids.  You take care and have hope!", "3567": "Sounds like you're feeling nostalgic.  What games were you plaing?", "3568": "I've never played it but its supposed to havea bunch of old game characters in it", "3569": "Oh, how did it go?", "3570": "I'm sorry, I am sure you will be ready next time.", "3571": "Wait, why would you be annoyed by that? That's amazing!", "3572": "I think you need to look at the bigger picture, though. Someone cured a disease that has caused so much suffering for so many people. Though I suppose to can be both excited for the discovery and jealous at the same time. The two aren't mutually exclusive.", "3573": "What movie did you see", "3574": "Yeah I have heard bad things to be honest", "3575": "Wow. Does he usually do stuff like that?", "3576": "Damn well, he's gonna have to learn some boundaries with that.", "3577": "It is indeed unfair, they shouldn't have done that", "3578": "you are right. But hey people just do what they want to!!", "3579": "I bet that was awkward", "3580": "I guess that happens sometimes, did you finish the game", "3581": "That is terrible and a little odd!", "3582": "Wait, you were ok with her cheating?", "3583": "Yes indeed! what did you do?", "3584": "You did great! Family comes first. And you gave him your support!", "3585": "That's great!!  History is so important I think and so few kids really grasp it well.  Congrats to him for a job well done!", "3586": "Oh, I see what you are saying!  Did he get upset about it?  And you never know, he could turn it around next year and blow you away!", "3587": "Wow, is that true? That's pretty amazing! I'd say science should know about your dog.", "3588": "Wow, that surely is incredible! Even the accent too? And intelligent! The full package!", "3589": "Dang, that's a lot of dogs. Cleaned out the pound, you did. But that doesn't hold a candle to the 100 I ate yesterday.", "3590": "How dare you question my intestinal fortitude?!? I would watch out, friend. I may just slip some cyanide in your relish if I ever have the chance to challenge you!", "3591": "That is so nice of him. Are you feeling better?", "3592": "That's good to hear. I hope I meet someone that will do that for me.", "3593": "That would bring the tears. I love looking at pictures especially old ones.", "3594": "Sounds like you are conflicted. She ran off but she's the best? Are you being sarcastic?", "3595": "That's a tragedy! What ever did you do?!?!", "3596": "Serves her right! These animals can't go around thinking they can poop on our things!", "3597": "Holy moses, he must be as smart as me. I solved that thing in five minutes last week. Child's play.", "3598": "Yeah, that's what they tell everyone because, in reality, they blew all the prize money on the very same thing themselves. I was pretty peeved that I couldn't even get a dime bag and the sleeziest of hookers.", "3599": "Ahh, that's too bad, did you mention it to your boss?", "3600": "Oh I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe next time!", "3601": "I bet. That is so sad. I am so sorry.", "3602": "I bet! I hope they can find peace soon.", "3603": "Time will make it better. You just have to move on.", "3604": "Better to find out now then move in and invest your time. Trust me it's worse.", "3605": "Really? What kind was it?", "3606": "Oh I love apple pie with ice cream, it's such a good combination", "3607": "Nice, I wish I could get a pair of those shoes.", "3608": "How much did you pay for them?", "3609": "I love a warm fire outside while camping! Sounds like a great time.", "3610": "Yes that sounds like a wonderful way to sleep.", "3611": "That sounds like it could be quite a scary experience.", "3612": "Oh yeah that's a bit dangerous. Candles are good to have on hang.", "3613": "Why are you worried?", "3614": "That is true but Dubai is a bit better", "3615": "Oh no! Was it still there when you went back?", "3616": "You never know these days. Luckily there are cameras everywhere.", "3617": "why? are you having financial problems?", "3618": "oh god , that sounds horrible but at least nothing bas happened to you!", "3619": "Oh no, what did you do to stay cheerful ?", "3620": "Sounds good, when she got back I hope you schooled her on Halo ?", "3621": "what kind of health problems ?", "3622": "i'm glad you feel good today!", "3623": "lol! I remember those drills when I was a kid!", "3624": "And your largest hardback book will protect you from a tornado as long as you put it over your head and sit in the hall!!", "3625": "That's normal. Try to just be your self. I'm sure it will work out fine.", "3626": "Amen, me too.   I hate my current job.", "3627": "It's not crazy! I'm all about cleaning up. I LOVE the smell of clean house", "3628": "I find it very satisfactory to clean and vacuum :) I bet it will smell so good", "3629": "That's good. I know that would be difficult.", "3630": "That is great. I am sure you are proud and you should be!", "3631": "That's always both an exciting time and a nerve-wracking time. I'm in college and I had to move the past two years in a row. This year, I decided I kinda had enough and would just stay put, even though the apartment was just so-so. Do you like it well enough even if the neighbors may give you trouble?", "3632": "Oh yeah, I know the type. Where they sound like they're having a parade at 3AM. Sorry you had to go through that. Luckily (or unluckily, if you want to see it that way) I have a loud window AC unit in my apartment, so even if they did make noise, I couldn't hear them over it!", "3633": "Oh wow that is a huge commitment! How did it go?", "3634": "That is really awesome! Im glad it all worked out for you!", "3635": "Yes I feel like that every time I look at old pictures!", "3636": "I agree and time jut goes by too fast!", "3637": "Do you reach out to your friends from your childhood?", "3638": "Exhaust all options, social media is a big way to stay connected", "3639": "Wow!  What was in the package?", "3640": "That was really nice!  What a wonderful surprise!  This act of kindness helps to restore my faith in humanity.", "3641": "Nice do you still keep in touch with her", "3642": "Well if you stay in touch then I'm sure she'll come back...but in the meantime try to take your mind off her or get involved in something fun so you have cool stories to tell her", "3643": "What book do you enjoy reading?", "3644": "No, actually I'm under a lot of stress right now and I'm in pretty dire straights financially. The only book i'm really reading at this time is the Bible.", "3645": "Where is your home village?", "3646": "That's a shame. Im sorry to hear that.", "3647": "Do you live in the United States now?", "3648": "Yes it sounds like it was a great place to grow up.", "3649": "I love dogs! What breed is he?", "3650": "That's so sweet! We have blue healers, they just make the world better.", "3651": "Oh my goodness, that must have been terrifying until you figured out what was going on.", "3652": "Well at least you had a good time.  Did they do something nice for you after?", "3653": "Do you ever offer to help thm?", "3654": "GOod for you, I feel bad for never helping out.", "3655": "Awesome.  What are you going to do with the money.", "3656": "Don't spend it all in one place :)", "3657": "Putting it away for a rainy day is the best bet.,", "3658": "Haha, that's a nice way to enjoy a sad moment, how are you feeling recently?", "3659": "I'm happy to hear you're doing better. If you feel that way again please reach out.", "3660": "Oh my, you must have been annoyed with your cat. I guess he just wanted your attention.", "3661": "Aw he's just a kitty after all. I'm sure he didn't mean to make you mad.", "3662": "What prize was it, or what was the competition, rather? I'm interested to know, but don't want to pry, if you don't feel like saying.", "3663": "Ah, gotcha. It's good to see that you tried and that you care that much. Most people are too lazy or scared to compete in things, myself included. I hope you continue to do the things that make you competitive and interested.", "3664": "Was it any good?", "3665": "Sometimes the cheap things are the best", "3666": "I bet it is! When my grandma was alive it was so heartbreaking to see her in pain. She broke her hip right before her death and she just couldn't recover", "3667": "i hope she will recover soon. Stay strong and think positive", "3668": "where is that ?", "3669": "isnt that where bruno is from ?", "3670": "That's great that they accomplished that and even better that you recognize their achievements.", "3671": "OK I didn't realize that they may have gone after you were born as opposed to before.", "3672": "I am prepared to go camping tonight in the woods", "3673": "That sounds peculiar. I've never known a dog with such finesse, yours may have talent.", "3674": "That's really cool, it makes me want to consider getting a dog.", "3675": "what did she do ?", "3676": "wow that was nice of her", "3677": "What kind of gaming is it?", "3678": "That's sounds interesting!", "3679": "I'd imagine so.  How long have you been a sky diving instructor for?", "3680": "Aweseme.  I want to go skydiving sometime.", "3681": "wow thats a good job", "3682": "keep it up!", "3683": "That sounds frustrating. How did it affect you?", "3684": "Ooh, that would be aggravating. I guess there isn't much you can do.", "3685": "Best of luck! What are you bidding for", "3686": "Archie? marvel? dc?", "3687": "Sometimes dogs just bark a lot. Did anything happen?", "3688": "Thank goodness. I'd be scared, too. You can't really know whether a dog is harmless or not sometimes.", "3689": "It has, what did you see that impressed you?", "3690": "They're more powerful than that. More like an early 2000's computer.", "3691": "What did i tell you about doing that. It was a chocolate cake right?", "3692": "Ok, at least it was the right kind of cake you liked. But still not a good thing.", "3693": "That is really great.  You don't find too many people willing to help others financially.  Do you have a really good job?", "3694": "It's good just to have enough these days.", "3695": "Which film was it?", "3696": "I haven't heard of it, sounds interesting though.", "3697": "That's good. I live in a small town but we have a big shopping center across the street and there are all the stores i love", "3698": "wow even organic store? that's pretty cool", "3699": "Really? It doesn't bother me at all. I wonder why you feel that way?", "3700": "Well, most people have intense likes and dislikes. Personally, I can't stand cigar smoke, but some people love it! I guess in your case, you need to scrape the food off the plate first.", "3701": "I can imagine they are a right pain to pick up after!", "3702": "What an annoyance!", "3703": "Oh me too. I'm not a driver but that is so annoying.", "3704": "It can be really dangerous too", "3705": "That is terrible.  Was it dead or just injured?", "3706": "That is true.  I would hate for people to be shooting things that close to my house, too.  Do you know who it was?", "3707": "What's been holding you back?", "3708": "That's a tough decision to make. It's good to try new things sometimes and I'm sure the waiters can recommend you a nice meal you'll enjoy based off your preferences.", "3709": "That is very cool!  I love when food is authentic.  Do you shop there often?", "3710": "I have never tried making Indian food myself, but I do really enjoy Indian restaurants.  I am jealous.", "3711": "That's awesome!  Have you gotten any better yet?", "3712": "That would be cool.  Hopefully the hard work will pay off", "3713": "Urgh that sounds like the worst! How early?", "3714": "So inconsiderate! It reminds me of my neighbours doing building work one morning at 6AM!", "3715": "Me too!", "3716": "How many times do you need to tell them!? :(", "3717": "I tend to believe that those who have Biblical faith do have a certainty, that God will bless them despite circumstances.", "3718": "Oh really, when are you going to go see her?", "3719": "I hope you have a good time at the concert, and she sings all the songs you're looking forward to.", "3720": "Congratulations! That must have been such a great feeling.", "3721": "I can't wait for the day I move out into my own place!", "3722": "I do, I live with my parents because I'm in university and I'm still pretty young. Hopefully by next year!", "3723": "Those are my nightmares. They are so big where I live in the South.", "3724": "I would immediately start spraying bug spray all over. Those things terrify me.", "3725": "I don't know how you do it. I can't stand long drives.", "3726": "Definitely not! Music is a great idea though; I listen to music on all bus rides and car rides.", "3727": "Thats awesome.  What kind of computer are you getting?", "3728": "very nice.  Id be super excited too.  Have some fun playing with it", "3729": "Yeah it is really nice to have other people do your shopping", "3730": "Shopping is no fun, waiting in lines is not fun.", "3731": "I haven't heard of that movie. What's depressing about it?", "3732": "Oh dear. I think I'll give it a miss - I cry at the drop of a hat! You should watch a comedy next, just to cheer yourself up!", "3733": "ohhh cute!! i am so happy for you, smart boy!", "3734": "a rare one, i hope he goes a long way and maybe even be the next Einstein we need", "3735": "What did you do there?", "3736": "Sounds painful, did you have to go to the doctor?", "3737": "oh god, that must have been the worst way to wake up in the morning", "3738": "oh, do you have any revenge planned?", "3739": "That is really scary!  What was it?", "3740": "Yuck!  Stay away from that guy!", "3741": "Sounds like quite an adventure for one semester! What was your favorite place?", "3742": "Nice! Must have made you really happy to see so many different places.", "3743": "Lol! I thought you were going to say MESSY! Good kids!", "3744": "So true! Maybe they want something or they did something bad and are hiding it lol", "3745": "Lol ;) Well enjoy the clean house, don't worry about the rest!", "3746": "oh awesome, i love ziplining, last time i went was 3 years ago tho, how did you find it?", "3747": "did you enjoy yourself", "3748": "Ouch sucks to be you! jk Did you ice it down", "3749": "Yes hope you feel better", "3750": "Oh no. I have been there before. It was really sad.", "3751": "It is sometimes for the best but that doesnt always make it easy.", "3752": "How did you do that? Naturally or with chemo?", "3753": "I bet! Look in too Chlorella and similar to get rid of any toxins from the chemo :)", "3754": "oh yeah? where you planning to move to?", "3755": "oh that's a very good reason to go, i am happy for you", "3756": "this is what you need to do, get out of your car and go give them a beat down that they need", "3757": "yea but it will feel better if you take action", "3758": "oh does that sadden you?", "3759": "animals are far better than humans, most humans have long lot their way and follow only their desires, i am also like you and i embrace it and smile :)", "3760": "What are magic cards?", "3761": "Oh interesting! Kind of like pokemon cards>?", "3762": "oh that's sad, i am sorry for this, where are you going and what  will you do about your dog?", "3763": "hmmm I got an idea, how about when you come back you give her an amazing time?", "3764": "Well I hope that you find something. Any particular reason that you are job hunting?", "3765": "Keep it up and I'm sure something will turn up!", "3766": "how lucky you feeling?", "3767": "well if it's worth anything i give you my luck! i hope you win that mustang!", "3768": "That sounds dangerous! You should try to move", "3769": "You really should! With things like that happening you could get seriously injured", "3770": "Cool! That sounds like a great time!", "3771": "Wow that's pretty deep!", "3772": "Wow, that had to be quite a surprise.  I hope you like them", "3773": "Well thats good.  Hopefully it was a good party!", "3774": "What brand are they?", "3775": "That is crazy did you go return them maybe?", "3776": "and what happened?", "3777": "how long is a marathon?", "3778": "Are you nervous?", "3779": "Good Luck!", "3780": "Oh no! I hope no one took it!", "3781": "Did you go back for it and get it?", "3782": "Wow ! thats quite an accomplishment. How long did you have to practice to perfect that ?", "3783": "Fantastic ! When you get older, your memory tends to play tricks on you lol", "3784": "Oh really? Any interesting ones?", "3785": "That's awful! Sounds like it might have caused you some trauma unfortunately.", "3786": "Did you catch the person after?", "3787": "That is unreal, what did you have in the bags?", "3788": "oh my gosh. what happened to him?", "3789": "i bet is was. are you ok?", "3790": "Oh my god, that is a LOT of weight!", "3791": "That's really cool, I honestly can't even imagine someone lifting that much!", "3792": "I've been to one before with my girlfriend, what an amazing experience eh?", "3793": "Aren't you the luckiest?", "3794": "Really? What was it?", "3795": "Oh gross! I would be startled too!", "3796": "You must be mad at the cat for that.", "3797": "You got too, my cats dont do that thankfully.", "3798": "I am so sorry to hear that. We need memories of our fur babies to help us in our grief.", "3799": "People do not realize that Animals can get cancer too.  Its more common than we may think.", "3800": "That sounds nice. It's always good to remember better times. What kind of music?", "3801": "Ha, I used to listen to that stuff back in high school. The My Chemical Romance gets me every time.", "3802": "Guess you dog isn't one that's going to take the bullet?", "3803": "lol I've never seen an armadillo but that sounds freaky!", "3804": "Did you help it?", "3805": "I hope it get's better! That sounded harsh", "3806": "what do you all have planned", "3807": "that sounds nice, must be a really good friend", "3808": "What a fantastic feeling. Where you expecting that?", "3809": "Well then. What a great surprise. It sounds like you deserved it.", "3810": "For what kind of project?", "3811": "Did you tell them to leave you alone?", "3812": "what about doing something you enjoy?", "3813": "i know it can be tough but maybe trying something new or outside your comfort zone might give you an enjoyable experience", "3814": "What is parvo?", "3815": "That's terrible. Can you confirm it?", "3816": "I hope she is okay.", "3817": "How ever so exciting! is this your first cruise?", "3818": "I hope you have a great trip and cherish the time with your family!", "3819": "well that was mighty nice of them, you wash dishes ?", "3820": "thats cool", "3821": "this summer's weather has been really intense here and honestly a little scary", "3822": "i hope it doesn't get too bad near you", "3823": "Why did he get called back in?", "3824": "Wow, did he get paid for it?", "3825": "my sister loves mac and cheese. she would probably live off of that if given the chance", "3826": "i like paprika in my mac and cheese", "3827": "What kind of necklace did you purchase? It's good to treat yourself some times.", "3828": "You will just make sure you have your nice new shirt on with that cool necklace and you will be all eyes lol.", "3829": "It could be a medical problem. Make sure its checked out.", "3830": "Ohh I see. That is super annoying. Hopefully she gets over this phase and they get along.", "3831": "You must have really proud of yourself. Its good to acknowledge your own achievements from time to time.", "3832": "I agree, which is why getting into that position can be so gratifying. Hopefully you maintain that level of hard work that got you there.", "3833": "oh that sounds nice", "3834": "sounds like a great time, hopefully its not too hot out there", "3835": "That sounds like heaven to me as well", "3836": "I have a cat too close to me, they are the best", "3837": "Oh thoughtful ! Did she enjoy playing with it ?", "3838": "Its quite wonderful to share your childhood memories with your children isn't it ?", "3839": "Congratulations. Are you going on a hollywood", "3840": "Well I am happy for you", "3841": "That is terrible. Why do you think that he will lose his job?", "3842": "I understand. That is very stressful. Did he started looking for another jod? It could be solution.", "3843": "Thats sad. I love cats", "3844": "How old was the cat?", "3845": "Thats awesome. Did she?", "3846": "I bet you are so proud. I would definitely be", "3847": "Why?", "3848": "What happened after your car crashed?", "3849": "Flies are so annoying", "3850": "I had that problem with a mosquito once. I woke up with a bite on the tip of my nose", "3851": "I would have hated to clean that up. I wonder why they do that?", "3852": "Yea that is so gross but also kind of funny. I cant help but laugh.", "3853": "Do you have to give a big speech soon?", "3854": "That's the way to go! Practice and practice until you're confident and then the real thing will be a breeze.", "3855": "That is horrible. Does he puke up hairball often?", "3856": "I understand.", "3857": "I bet it was very embarrassing?", "3858": "It's alright we've all been there many times.", "3859": "What kind of pizza is it?", "3860": "Thats never good, I love pizza", "3861": "Oh no! That must be so frustrating being in a foreign country", "3862": "I'm glad you eventually found it and didn't have to sleep somewhere else.", "3863": "Ahh, it happens. I used to swim competitively so I would sometimes get stunned too when I hear the gun go off", "3864": "Ahaha, I hate running too", "3865": "Huh, ok.  Do you like her a lot?", "3866": "Sounds like you don't have much respect for women.", "3867": "Sometimes the simplest things are the nicest", "3868": "I hope you have many more then!", "3869": "What did you do in response?", "3870": "That's awful, did you get injured at all?", "3871": "That is a terrible tragedy, my friend. Did the dog get sick?", "3872": "Well that's good. What did you find?", "3873": "Did you ask him to turn it down?  Or did you just go flip the circuit breaker to the house?", "3874": "Did he do it?  Cause if not, I might have needed to give him a high five, on the head, with a chair.", "3875": "That is pretty disgusting! Did it look like poo coming out again?", "3876": "I can imagine. Maybe it'll morph into a Super Saiyan poo or something.", "3877": "That's a dang shame. Did it get rained on?", "3878": "That's too bad. Well, on the bright side, maybe a hobo will find it, read it, enlighten himself, and get a job at McDonalds.", "3879": "Wow that must have been a surprise for you", "3880": "you got a great husband", "3881": "I know how you feel, it's terrible. I actually moved to a completely different state due to hi taxes.", "3882": "It's worth it to consider. I pay less than half in property tax than I used to.", "3883": "Always do the same what? What is perfect?", "3884": "I have been married for 19 years and we have been together 21.", "3885": "I've been through that process before and it was not easy. Good thing you had a good adviser.", "3886": "You have been very lucky. You should keep their business card in case you ever decide to buy another house.", "3887": "I hate when that happens!", "3888": "That's how it goes. I usually consider the money as a lost cause when lending to friends.", "3889": "Did what?", "3890": "I have too... to pay for food though. She told me that she would have paid if I asked but I am too proud.", "3891": "Sounds like found!   Are you scared of roller coasters?  I love them!", "3892": "I hope you do have fun!", "3893": "I know how you feel! Our dog of 8 years past away last week spring. It can be so hard", "3894": "Same here. We don't know. He was perfectly fine the night before. We woke up to find him passed away at the foot of our bed. Do you know how yours passed?", "3895": "What kind of thing?  You could always change that in the future.", "3896": "Of course, but that is certainly not the most important thing in life, I hope you realize now.", "3897": "That's such a great feeling.", "3898": "That sounds really nice. I don't know my neighbors at all", "3899": "I watch everyday. love youtube!", "3900": "I like self help, motivation, healthy living, and a little bit of conspiracy.", "3901": "Oh I get those midnight cravings all the time!", "3902": "You want cake? Cake is there? Obviously you have to eat it! Lol", "3903": "That sounds like a fun thing to do as a couple.", "3904": "Why were you so scared?", "3905": "Oh really, that sounds nice. I miss childhood.", "3906": "Sometimes I feel as though our generation (assuming you're a few years around 30) really got a bad deal as far as the economy, politics, and the overall love in the country is concerned.", "3907": "Things work out. It doesn't seem like it but they do.", "3908": "It will. I am sure of it.", "3909": "Is the city going to build them new ones at least?", "3910": "Well at least they bought them out and they won't be homeless. Still sucks though.", "3911": "Oh no! How badly did you hurt yourself?", "3912": "That doesn't sound too bad, it could have been much worse!", "3913": "Yes I do play some video games.", "3914": "I've heard some very good things about it. It doesn't come out until November right?", "3915": "Sometimes life isn't very fair. I like to think of it as motivation to get a better job.", "3916": "It happens, I think it's part of human nature. Just try and focus on your own well-being and you'll be alright!", "3917": "Good for you!.  My year have been ok too so far.", "3918": "You seem to be very hopeful!  That is great.", "3919": "I'm so glad to hear that! Did anything in particular make it a good day? Mine's been awesome too!", "3920": "Sick, congratulations! Time to celebrate right?", "3921": "How awful, besides painful, it must have been scary!", "3922": "Were you messing with them, maybe? or taking their honey?", "3923": "I do, as if it were yesterday. I remember most of my childhood through video games.", "3924": "I really want to, but unfortunately my GameCube and N64 no longer function. Also a few of my favorite games are scratched to heck.", "3925": "I'm glad to hear that! Things are really going great for me too!", "3926": "Same here.

How do you feel?", "4270": "It's going to help your family out so much I bet everyone is so proud of you, congrats you deserve it.", "4271": "That's rough, I'm sorry to hear that", "4272": "I am sure you will find someone who will love you even more than your ex did soon.", "4273": "That's too bad, you have to go out and make new friends.", "4274": "Suck it up and get out there, it is the only way or you will end up very lonely.", "4275": "Oh I'm so sorry to hear that!", "4276": "Is there somewhere you can go for extra help with that course? A tutor or something?", "4277": "That's so annoying.  I hate it when that happens.", "4278": "Can you block her out, maybe?  Get some noise blocking headphones?", "4279": "The ones with the little colored sliders on the end? Those were cool!", "4280": "I liked them too.", "4281": "Has it been on the market for long?", "4282": "Wow! That's awesome. I'm sure you'll sell soon.", "4283": "oh that's too bad, what did you end up doing", "4284": "you should defently and don't let this affect you too much, maybe she has a good reason", "4285": "that must have been an explosion and a half, did  you clean it up?", "4286": "i can imagine, that's gross as hell", "4287": "oh no! that's terrible! I've had that happen before and it sucks", "4288": "I can imagine. did they steal anything?", "4289": "I know what you mean.  I love to see all the pictures, and think back to how little mine used to be.", "4290": "They do seem to be grown before you know it.  Make you wonder how if goes so fast!", "4291": "Sometimes it's ok to indulge. Did it give you a stomachache though lol?", "4292": "You should follow up with a few veggies later on maybe to balance it out. I know that feeling though. Its just so good you can't eat just one lol", "4293": "I'm so sorry for your loss! It's so hard to lose a parent.", "4294": "Sadly, I don't think we can ever be prepared for that kind of loss.", "4295": "Wow,  that's so nice of you", "4296": "That is cool.  You are really so caring", "4297": "Oh darn, that sucks.  Keeping a positive attitude is the way to go! I'm sure something is out there for you.", "4298": "And here the job market was supposed to get great again.  lol", "4299": "Oh no! Can you replace it?", "4300": "I'm sure your friend will be understanding that it was a mistake.", "4301": "oh no I am sorry to hear that! They must have been really busy and it must have slipped their mind", "4302": "I am sure they had their reasons, maybe you should give them a call and see if everything is alright. They may be going through their own problems right now.", "4303": "I agree. The sound of birdsong, a gentle breeze on a summer's day, the purring of your tabby-cat. You can't beat that, can you?", "4304": "You should! Forget about your worries, if only for a moment. You'll return feeling refreshed.", "4305": "Yikes, that's not a fun situation. Did you figure it out pretty quickly?", "4306": "That's good, I'd be mortified if that happened to me.", "4307": "I've had that happen before. My cat is definitely more my wife's cat now. Does he still cuddle up with you?", "4308": "Haha, same for me. It's like as soon as my wife is available to sit or lay with, I'm chopped liver.", "4309": "I'm sorry for your loss, I bet you two were close. What did he leave you?", "4310": "Oh he worked for congress? That's very interesting. That sounds like an awesome haul of vintage stuff.", "4311": "That was kind of you! Has his truck been repaired?", "4312": "Of course! Your dad is very trustworthy.", "4313": "Can you please give a little more detail about what happened at your friends house that made you not want to show your face??", "4314": "How embarrassing! I did that one time when I was sleeping in my bed and I thought I got up and went to the bathroom to pee, but I did not go to the bathroom, I peed my pants in the bed.", "4315": "That is so cool, my mother in law has bears come into her yard! I'd be happy with the hummingbirds, so pretty.", "4316": "The squirrels keep stealing the feed in my birdfeeder, they do trapeze to get to it.", "4317": "That's amazing! We just got a new puppy this last weekend also! What kind is yours?", "4318": "Aw that is super cute! Dogs bring such happiness to a home.", "4319": "Oh man, I'm really sorry you have to go through that. Betrayal like that is so painful. How are you doing?", "4320": "Of course, no one deserves to have their heartbroken like that. I hope you find someone who treats you with the respect and kindness you deserve.", "4321": "Sugar is very addicting! I'm glad you could make it", "4322": "Caffeine headaches are no joke.", "4323": "Sounds like you were just misunderstood. I discuss things with my husband, too, and it's not like talking behind someone's back. That's what married couples do. Don't feel bad.", "4324": "Yes, just tell her your home is a safe place to talk. It's okay to open up in the family.", "4325": "Awesome! Did you play any of them after you found the box?", "4326": "Neat! I haven't played them. Even though everything is becoming digital, I find there is something special about the physical copies!", "4327": "Ugh, sorry! You must be disappointed. But remember if the door doesn't open, it probably wasn't yours. There's something else in store for you!", "4328": "Sometimes they already have a candidate in mind but have to go through the motion...the same thing happened to my husband. Your time will come.", "4329": "I can't even imagine how devastating that would be. I think you must be really strong to be able to move forward.", "4330": "You might, but I believe you can have a full life as a single person, too.", "4331": "Wow! A 20 foot boat, that must be amazing to take out on the lake! How much did it cost you?", "4332": "Id love to own a boat, are you using it for leisure or fishing etc?", "4333": "They both sound like great plans! Tubing would be a great way to keep her happy while you fish haha!", "4334": "I hope you do! It makes you feel like you've actually earned it!", "4335": "I'm always leery of loaning money to friends", "4336": "That was a nice surprise!  I have tried lending money to friends but finally had to stop after never getting it back", "4337": "Oh no! How sad! Did you ever find him?", "4338": "Oh, how awful! I'm so sorry!", "4339": "Wow, very cool. The last time i tried to skateboard i almost broke my tailbone. props to you though!", "4340": "Is it though? haha. If you can do it without falling down then you are doing better than me. Probably a good bonding experience i'd imagine.", "4341": "Too bad for them! My sons 6th birthday was just last week, and we had a fun party. There so much easier to please when their little lol.", "4342": "They do. I can't believe how fast the time goes.", "4343": "That must have been aggravating! Job hunting is so hard.", "4344": "Maybe something better will come along!", "4345": "Well I hope you got there in time and nothing bad happened.", "4346": "Oh know! I hope you weren't heading to a job interview, haha.", "4347": "I'm so sorry. Have you tried any natural remedies?", "4348": "I hope you find something that gives you some relief!", "4349": "That's awesome. Did you get him it? I bet he loves it.", "4350": "Haha I would've done the same. Those toys always make me lose myself. They're so much fun!", "4351": "Wow you were lucky! It has happened to me before too. It feels so violating.", "4352": "Because you were not in it. :)", "4353": "That is so nice of you all! I know she appreciates it.", "4354": "Aww, I'm so sorry but know you made a difference in her life.", "4355": "that is good! did he make any friends?", "4356": "That is really cute!", "4357": "That's awesome! Whats your secret to success?", "4358": "Well he seems to be guiding you in the right direction. I hope your blessings continue!", "4359": "First day of school I remember ,my kids first day of school, how did it make you feel?", "4360": "yes it does but we always got or memories.", "4361": "Neither could I.  It was the first thing that was on the news right after I woke up.", "4362": "Yea, I try not to think about that though because then it makes me sad.", "4363": "That sounds amazing! How long does it take to make the beans? Do you have to soak them?", "4364": "I can smell the beans and sausage as we speak.. I always find after cooking I'm never hungry. Maybe that's because I snacked the entire time I was cooking.", "4365": "Oh no.  In those cases, it's either the best news or the worst news.", "4366": "I'm sorry to hear that.  Unfortunately, I know that same feeling all too well.", "4367": "Woo hoo! That is awesome! Congrats! When will you find out/", "4368": "I hope so too! I'll be sure to keep my fingers crossed for you! Good luck!", "4369": "Good think you're prepared \ud83d\udc4d", "4370": "Hopefullybeveryday goes well.", "4371": "Oh no!  That's such a shame.  Did you go to the principal?", "4372": "I'm so sorry!  I hope it gets better for her.  Middle school is no picnic, that's for sure.", "4373": "Oh no! That's horrible. Please tell me you didn't.", "4374": "Awww, that is awesome! I am so proud of you!", "4375": "that is so sad i hope your pet gets better", "4376": "that is so sweet, i think that is why she got better, your caring ways", "4377": "Do you like cats? Kittens are the best!", "4378": "Yes I love cats as well I have one orange one and 4 dogs that get along pretty well all together", "4379": "Congrats!  How long have you been playing the cello?", "4380": "How did you place in the competition?", "4381": "Oh dear that's embarrassing! I hope you didn't hurt yourself.", "4382": "Oh ha! I guess that's painful!", "4383": "I am sorry. Breakups are the worst. Did he just not want to give up overtime or he worked 70hours always?", "4384": "That's rough but you deserve someone who is willing or wants to make the time for you. Never settle for less than what you are willing to settle for.", "4385": "Why did yall break up?", "4386": "That doesnt leave much time for yalls relationship", "4387": "Oh darn I hate when that happens! I've experienced the same thing in the past once.", "4388": "Yep not always a terrible time to eat out at least.", "4389": "How did they do?", "4390": "How old's your child?", "4391": "Just barely older than my son. I can definitely understand that.", "4392": "what happened why were their so many dead fish?", "4393": "I hope they are not using the lake for drinking water .", "4394": "Good luck! I'm sure it will be fine.", "4395": "You're too hard on yourself. Everyone messes up sometimes, even the greats.", "4396": "Yikes that's no good. How many stitches did you have to get?", "4397": "What happened to the dog afterwards?", "4398": "That's quite the win! What was the bet?", "4399": "Oh! Gotcha! I've never played the switch but I heard it's an exciting console!", "4400": "Oh cool, where does your friend live? Is it an exciting location?", "4401": "Oh man, don't bail on your trip. Try and get those thing that came taken care of this week. You don't want to disappoint her.", "4402": "Oh no, I bet your parents were freaking out.", "4403": "Oh that sucks getting blamed for it when it was their fault.", "4404": "Do you get much use out of it, or is it just collection dust?", "4405": "I guess you can hang on to it, or maybe there's someone else you both know who can show it some proper lovin'.", "4406": "well dang! that is very impressive!", "4407": "Understandable, i bet the had good budgeting skills and a nice job.", "4408": "Oh no!! That is terrible, do you know what happened?", "4409": "Oh no, I am sure they meant no harm, they always say that they are more curious when they are young.", "4410": "It will pass in time, even though it feels awful right now.", "4411": "Aw I'm sorry. I remember feeling like that and it was horrible.", "4412": "Oh that's great! 9 years together is a long time. You sound happy, I'm glad.", "4413": "What did y'all do? Did you do anything special that evening?", "4414": "Oh, I know exactly what you mean. It's not the same as going as a kid.", "4415": "Yeah, it's no wonder these animals go crazy on humans sometimes.", "4416": "Wow! what did you write about?", "4417": "Nice, well I hope you have a nice trip!", "4418": "Congrats! That's exciting. Is the new place far from your current home?", "4419": "Wow, thats really big! I hope you have a stress free move. I know it can be a little stressful, but you seem very excited!", "4420": "Wow, really? Did you have any feelings for him?", "4421": "Hahaha, that is so cute, I am sure he loved that you teased him like that! I bet your classmates also had a good laugh!", "4422": "Wow! What field are you going to be working in?", "4423": "Dang! I hope you make lots of money!", "4424": "Wow! Congrats to her, and I am sorry that you didn't get the prize. What did she win?", "4425": "Wow that is a great prize! Is she able to take anyone with her or is it just a ticket for one person?", "4426": "Wow, were you at a festival?", "4427": "I have seen that before. I have no idea how they can do that.", "4428": "o That sounds exciting. Moving or spring cleaning?", "4429": "Ya last time I moved I was packing for about 6 months. It's smarter to do it a little at a time and get things purged and organized.", "4430": "Oh no that is terrible, I can not believe that they would drive off without leaving any contact information! How bad was the accident?", "4431": "Wow, that is terrible. I hope that you are able to catch them or find surveillance videos of who did it, because most malls do have cameras in the parking lots.", "4432": "Aww were you excited when you picked her up?", "4433": "I bet! What kind of dog is she?", "4434": "Uh oh, be careful about that, you don't want him becoming dependent on you for handouts.", "4435": "Well that's good. I hope it works out for both of you, maybe you could give him some budgeting tips.", "4436": "Oh my god, you should have reported her.", "4437": "I am really appalled at people these days.", "4438": "Where to?", "4439": "Me too. Well I hope it is to somewhere that you like.", "4440": "I'm sorry to hear that.  Hopefully something similar comes along sooner than later.", "4441": "Just remember to keep your head up and don't give up!", "4442": "I do hope they stopped the car at least ! That sounds disgusting, but its better than throwing up in the car right ?", "4443": "I can imagine when something unexpected like that happens. I do hope they are ok now :) Sorry you had to witness that !", "4444": "New adventures! I want to go west.", "4445": "I bet you are nervous.", "4446": "Oh no. I bet they are going to charge you for a new one.", "4447": "Maybe they will understand.", "4448": "Aww. I had to put mine down last month. I miss her.", "4449": "Border collie. She was great!", "4450": "What kind of job did you get?", "4451": "What do you do as a statistic", "4452": "How do you think it will go? Are you confident?", "4453": "What subject is it?", "4454": "Uh oh. What happened?", "4455": "That is horrible! I hope he was okay.", "4456": "well that's good to hear I guess. what do you do?", "4457": "what's your most successful campaign so far?", "4458": "I always need convincing to take my yucky medicine", "4459": "that's amazing! what kind of job is it?", "4460": "i'm glad your interview went well, and i really hope you get that call soon!", "4461": "you can always make new friends, and talk to your old friends at the same time!", "4462": "yeah but you never know , you may make life changing friendships so be patient!", "4463": "You gotta stick with what you know sometimes.", "4464": "That's right. There's so sense in deviating.", "4465": "I feel you there, I have a ton of stuff to do, but I can't get any of it done in this rain.", "4466": "I really hope so, I am not sure how much longer I can let my yard grow before it gets too wild.", "4467": "oh I am so sorry. That must be fresh on your heart, may he rest in peace.", "4468": "I can only imagine. I am so sorry. What was his name?", "4469": "That is great to be prepared. Where do you live?", "4470": "Oh yeah, you definitely need to be prepared. Do you think you will get a hurricane?", "4471": "Wow, see enjoyment.", "4472": "You are so lucky. Some men pray for that kind of wife", "4473": "What kind of illness occurs if food is cross contaminated? I'm so sorry this happens to you.", "4474": "You suffer from it more severely than most people I know, this can be devastating to people.", "4475": "Wow that is weird.  I love Diet Coke.  What was wrong with it?", "4476": "Nothing worse than a bad soda! lol.  I like the new Freestyle machines, it's always just right.", "4477": "aww. I understand you. That feeling is priceless.", "4478": "It's alright to feel such sentiments buddy :)", "4479": "Yum!!! I love pancakes. Is it your favorite food too?", "4480": "That is great you have a sweet wife!", "4481": "It is so great to hear about a happy couple :)", "4482": "I bet she is a great cook!", "4483": "That sounds exciting! Is he good at keeping secrets?", "4484": "Fingers crossed for you!  I'm sure it will be fine.  Are you nervous?", "4485": "Being a business owner is hard. I'm sure she is grateful for your help.", "4486": "Yes, mental and emotional support is the best kind of support.", "4487": "What kind of car is it?", "4488": "ooh nice! just start to SAVE, SAVE,SAVE where ever you can and you will get there.", "4489": "Time goes by so fast. You'll see.", "4490": "LOL, well there is always luck!", "4491": "I remember those potty training days!!!    I bet you were so embarrassed.", "4492": "THank goodness you had extra supplies on hand.   My son was the hardest one out of my 3 kids to potty train.   I feel your pain!!", "4493": "Oh, did you give it to him yet?", "4494": "That's so cool. I'm sure he will love it! Where did you get it?", "4495": "I love vacations I hope you and him have a good time.", "4496": "What cruise line are you using did they give you a good discount.", "4497": "Oh my goodness! What happened?", "4498": "Is he okay now?", "4499": "Oh, I know what you mean. I have felt that way. Best thing to do is pray about it and don't be hard on yourself.", "4500": "That's amazing! I'm so happy your prayers were answered. God knows your heart.", "4501": "I've never done that but i know plenty of people who do that. Its normal every know and again but don't turn it into a daily habit!", "4502": "Damn that sounds good, honestly its fine every know and again. we all have a sweet tooth.", "4503": "Aw, yay!  How old is he?", "4504": "I love that age!  My niece just turned six and she seems so grown up!", "4505": "Oh thats awesome, im sure you were excited to help", "4506": "thats great, sounds like a fun time. And you got to share time with your daughters which is awesome.", "4507": "Oh that sucks, have you experienced the symptoms?", "4508": "Oh damn thats terrible, I hope it didn't affect your life too much.", "4509": "That sucks, hopefully its just something minor. You're a good person for taking care of her", "4510": "Oh, that sounds bad, probably a stomach virus. those suck!", "4511": "Thats great, perfect time to unwind and relax, and earn money!", "4512": "Awesome, sometimes they can get annoying always running around and nagging you.", "4513": "How did it go?", "4514": "I'd have been nervous too.  When will you find out?", "4515": "Oh, I would love time away like that! How did you enjoy it?", "4516": "That sounds wonderful! My body is craving something like this. Thanks for the inspiration!", "4517": "Oh no, did they do something embarrasing?", "4518": "That's absolutely disgusting!", "4519": "Did the two of you have fun?", "4520": "That's awesome. My son has a skateboard but can barely stand up on it.", "4521": "I am sorry that you are out of work.  Have you had any job interviews? It is good that your father is able to help you during this time.", "4522": "Well, I am glad you will hopefully get some disability income.  It sounds like your dad isn't the type who expects to be repayed.  He sounds like a great parent.", "4523": "Did everything work out ok? How did you like them?", "4524": "Oh, me too. I don't even like to sit in the waiting room.", "4525": "Interesting, are you feeling OK having less bonding time?", "4526": "I see, I imagine time will start to fly once you take up a new hobby, or school ends for the day.", "4527": "That's not very fun. I hate traveling like that.", "4528": "At least you got to see your family for a little bit.", "4529": "Ew, that's always the worst. What were you getting?", "4530": "That's always the case! So annoying. I love the self checkout options. I wish more places had that.", "4531": "Oh no! I am sorry to hear of your loss. Are you taking it ok?", "4532": "Yeah, funerals are really sad but they can make one appreciate life so much more.", "4533": "Wow i'd be jealous", "4534": "Same. I have a chance in a few years to go with the family but not 100%.", "4535": "I bet it is! I love getting together with friends, especially if it has been a while...which it seems to be the older I get.", "4536": "I bet it would be tough.  Was there a special occasion that brought you all together?", "4537": "Thats so awesome! I hope you all had a ton of fun!", "4538": "Hahaha, yes we women don't want to get the men angry. But clothes are so expensive these days. We just want to look good for our men.", "4539": "I guess you can just tell her like you told me just now. Maybe she won't be afraid to tell you next time....... well maybe, lol.", "4540": "Yikes, that doesnt happen too often in today's culture.  Did you say anything?", "4541": "That might be for the best.  Were they arguing about her color or something else?", "4542": "Thats really annoying. It would be great if people would just let other people be.", "4543": "I'm sorry you don't get to see her much. I don't see mine often either. I'm sure it did make you sad.", "4544": "Yeah, I understand that. I live about 45 minutes from mine and everyone is so busy all the time. Maybe you will be able to see her soon.", "4545": "Great! Are you home all day or do you just get them off to school and then head to work yourself?", "4546": "For sure! I bet it was nice to have the hosue a little more quiet too.", "4547": "Oh that must have been torture! Is everything alright?", "4548": "I can imagine. Glad you are ok though! :)", "4549": "Oh no! that's no bueno. Usually the person that wants the least deserves the most. Thats sad", "4550": "Oh that's awful and borderline abusive", "4551": "ah, you must have great memories than", "4552": "you know today's events are tomorrow's memories", "4553": "Cool! What kind of fish do you expect to catch there?", "4554": "Yum! Invite me over for some fish dinner sometime, won't you?", "4555": "That sounds like fun!  Is it with friends?", "4556": "So cool, I hope it goes well", "4557": "That is", "4558": "That is so nice when family visits. It is so much fun! But yeah, it is a lot of work for sure.", "4559": "Oh, Happy early Birthday! What is it that you are hoping for?", "4560": "Nice! I hope you get it! Cameras are such a wonderful tool to have these days and there are so many cool options to choose from.", "4561": "oh jeez! what a mess.", "4562": "I like dogs but thats why i dont have one lol", "4563": "Excellent! Stay hydrated!", "4564": "Sounds like fun!", "4565": "Wow, that sounds quite disturbing. Was someone breaking in?", "4566": "I'm glad everything turned out okay!", "4567": "Yeah flooding is a real problems these days. The weather is crazy! Hopefully you and your house will stay nice and dry.", "4568": "I would be scared too. I hope everything will be ok for you. Fingers crossed.", "4569": "you sort of gamble on store bought cakes, did you take it back?", "4570": "you are a lot bravery than I, I do't think i could it eat", "4571": "Do you feel any less nervous?  Job interviews are always nerve-wracking", "4572": "Either way, as long as you feel a little bit better it was worth it.  I'm sure you'll do great!", "4573": "Oh yeah! I love chocolate anything! But grandmas cooking is always the best of all!", "4574": "Not me! haha I love them all!", "4575": "that must be a cute picture", "4576": "so young and ready to conquer the world", "4577": "What video games are the two of you playing?", "4578": "It's always amazing how quickly kids pick up on new skills.", "4579": "You must really love that dip to have that much of a reaction to the loss of it.", "4580": "I would assume so, since there has to be someone out there who robbed you of your oniony gold!", "4581": "Congrats! is it a good promotion?", "4582": "Wow that is super exciting. Not many people get that opportunity. You must have worked hard", "4583": "Wow, that's really exciting! Good for you, you must be nervous.", "4584": "That's great, what kind of work are you in?", "4585": "Well I really hope you get it. You're right, you did what you could.", "4586": "That's horrible news!  I don't understand how people can be so cruel sometimes.", "4587": "I know in some places, the penalty for hurting an animal can be tougher than that for hurting your kids.  Nothing makes sense sometimes.", "4588": "Was that a good day for you?", "4589": "That's amazing! Sounds like a beauty day! Are you English?", "4590": "Oh, but I bet you appreciated it! Summer can get long.", "4591": "Oh, that does sound like a fun summer. I read recently that we only get 18 summers with our kids- make them count.", "4592": "It's good to stop and appreciate teh moment sometimes.", "4593": "Oh no, I can imagine so! Was it gunky?", "4594": "Oh goodness, glad you got through is safe lol", "4595": "Oh, that's not right. I have a rescue dog, she had a litter of puppies at a puppy mill before she was a year.", "4596": "I could chat with you all day! We have a lot in common- I feel the same way. Keep chatting? Poor rescue animals.", "4597": "That's great! So sad for those poor animals.", "4598": "They should- they say people who hurt animals will hurt people too.", "4599": "That sounds awesome, I'm glad he did well.", "4600": "I hope he gets the team he wants.", "4601": "You must be relieved! You excited for free time?", "4602": "That sounds seriously like a dream. I cannot wait until mine are old enough to start school.", "4603": "4 and 1. I have a bit to go haha.", "4604": "Awww that will be a boring week. Sorry to hear that. Maybe you'll be productive!", "4605": "I hope it flies by!", "4606": "Was the owner not around? Did the dog cause any harm?", "4607": "Sounds scary! Dogs are very loyal creatures but can cause a lot of harm", "4608": "That is very heartbreaking. How did you find the kitten?", "4609": "Very sad to hear. You have a good heart and are very caring, that is something to atleast be proud of!", "4610": "Kids pick those things up quickly.  And it'll help with her hand-eye coordination, reading - all sorts of things!", "4611": "Yeah.  Back when the only buttons on a controller were Start, Select, A and B!", "4612": "Oh no! Hopefully you are able to get it sorted out. It's hard to keep up with all the fees for kids schooling.", "4613": "Sounds like a headache, i know the feeling. I got a letter saying i had a few days to purchase a purple shirt from my daughters school. Good luck!", "4614": "That would be rough.  Hopefully youre in a better spot now!  Thats awesome you had family to help you out too!", "4615": "I bet they do! I mean they do go to school for a while and study hard, plus the schools arent cheap but they still dont have to charge as much as they do!", "4616": "i would love some quiet time to myself, consider yourself lucky!", "4617": "i have a husband and three kids, its always loud in my house", "4618": "Oh no! How did you guys get caught?", "4619": "I bet, did you both get in a lot of trouble?", "4620": "What movie was it?  Is it currently in theaters?", "4621": "Thats too bad! I was hoping that one was going to be good!", "4622": "Oh my gosh! I would be furious as well.", "4623": "I am sorry that happened. Don't do him any favors.", "4624": "Yeah, you need peace and quiet to be able to work.", "4625": "My son keeps trying to show me Youtube videos so I completely understand", "4626": "That is normal that just means that the other person is special", "4627": "Well i will keep my finger crossed for you!", "4628": "Yeah i can imagine but a little worm wont hurt ya", "4629": "I understand but atleast it was not poisonous", "4630": "I live in bear country.", "4631": "I bet I would have been scared", "4632": "Awwww. that is so sweet! Details. Boy, girl, breed.", "4633": "Awwwww. He sounds super cute! Have lots of fun with him.", "4634": "oopsy. I hope it was worth it.", "4635": "LOL! Can  you run out and get another pie before she gets home?", "4636": "That sounds terrifying, so glad you did not step on it", "4637": "I can imagine I would have nightmares about that", "4638": "And be watchful when you do!", "4639": "Congratulations. Thats always a plus.", "4640": "Good for you!", "4641": "If the movie is worth it you will never miss them.", "4642": "I understand. Its tough these days.", "4643": "I love butterflies because of the colors. What color was the butterfly?", "4644": "Yellow butterflies are beautiful. Photography can capture some great images a lot of times.", "4645": "Oh, my dog did that, too! I don't know how they think it's a tasty morsel...so gross!!", "4646": "I was just going to say the same thing! I'm like Stay away!", "4647": "I love cats.", "4648": "I agree absolutely", "4649": "Congratulations. I hope you get it?", "4650": "Just relax. If its meant to be it will be.", "4651": "That must have been scary..", "4652": "I bet", "4653": "How long did he think he had won?", "4654": "That was funny I bet.", "4655": "Oh wow, did you give him the money?", "4656": "That would be so scary, I am glad you are safe!", "4657": "I'm so sorry to hear that. How long had your cat been with you?", "4658": "It's always hard to go through that. That's why I'm wary of having any pets", "4659": "Does he like to sing?", "4660": "I bet he sings in the shower everyday.", "4661": "You must have worked hard for that! I'm sure it's great and you'll pass with a flying color!", "4662": "Yeah, such a relief to get a huge project done. You must feel proud!", "4663": "That must be really irritating. Is she doing it deliberately?", "4664": "Haha - maybe you'll learn to love it! There must be something good about it, if your sister has any taste.", "4665": "I've never been abroad before, but I'm going to spend two weeks in France next month!", "4666": "I am going to visit a few cities and tourist attractions.", "4667": "Oh no, did they get angry?", "4668": "Okay, I am glad that they were not angry. and I am sure they knew it was unintentional so don't feel too guilty about it. :)", "4669": "Wow you are very trusting, I do not think I would allow a friend to borrow my car. Is it legal for him to drive with just a permit?", "4670": "Oh okay I see, I thought you actually lent him your car and let him drive around town with it by himself!", "4671": "That's a big decision! What are your choices?", "4672": "If you want my advice - choose something you're going to enjoy. I personally couldn't be a nurse - too messy!", "4673": "I hoep you reach your goal. It must be tiring.", "4674": "Don't give up. Things may not be great one day but they always pick up eventually.", "4675": "that stinks were you guys going school clothes shopping?", "4676": "That's good, school shopping is always stressful for me", "4677": "okey no problem", "4678": "For mine too. That was also i said.", "4679": "I understand completely. One has to live within one's budget. It can be hard though.", "4680": "It's only normal to want to live within one's means. Too bad you can't leave a tip every time.", "4681": "Wow ! Thats quite unfortunate!", "4682": "Well handle it wisely", "4683": "It sounds like a stressful day. You have to just live in the present so, you will not be too stress out.", "4684": "When that is over then you can do you. We have to make time for ourselves.", "4685": "I'm very sorry for your loss. Thinking about and remember all of your good memories with her may help.", "4686": "That's a good way to remember her and keep her close to your heart.", "4687": "Yes, it does.", "4688": "That can't be easy. How old are your children? Sometimes I wish we could keep our kids small forever!", "4689": "Yeah you want them to learn, but it's definitely hard to see them doing things that you might not agree with.", "4690": "Wow that's really scary! Labor is a really terrifying thing, especially when something like that happens. Did everything turn out okay?", "4691": "I can imagine. When I was in the hospital with my 3 year old they lost all his vitals as well. Kids like to keep us on our toes from the start!", "4692": "What platform do you play it on? PC or PS4?", "4693": "PC is the way to go for gaming. That sounds like an awesome type of game. Is it multiplayer?", "4694": "That's so cute. How old is she?", "4695": "Oh mine. That is not cute.", "4696": "That's no good. Did you go to the doctor?", "4697": "Got to make sure you take care of your self. It's scary when your heat sensitive.", "4698": "It will be okay. We sometimes do things that we regret.", "4699": "You have to forgive ourselves. We don't need others validation.", "4700": "Will you be able to spend more time with her?", "4701": "I can imagine, but it's good that her hard work is about to pay off.", "4702": "What'd MS?", "4703": "Well ,I pray you get through it", "4704": "How do you feel about that ?", "4705": "Hopefully she re considers you should talk to her about it", "4706": "That is risky, what do you plan to do", "4707": "Okey if she is no cause for alarm", "4708": "Good. You sound confident. When is it?", "4709": "I'm sure you'll do great then!", "4710": "Oh how sweet, high school days is always fun", "4711": "Yes it does happen", "4712": "am sorry to hear that, may he rest in peace", "4713": "I hope you getting better now", "4714": "Oh no! I'm sorry. Is she going to be ok?", "4715": "Oh man. Don't feel guilty accidents happen. Hopefully she recovers quickly.", "4716": "Thats great what is your favorite meal?", "4717": "That sounds so good i love steaks", "4718": "It can been nerve-wracking to start a new job. But I'm sure you did well, right?", "4719": "It's wise to be careful but suspecting people all the time may not be healthy. You need to build a good relationship with your new co-workers.", "4720": "I know exactly how you feel. I have a crazy addiction to soda.  I don't think I can quit!", "4721": "Maybe try to slowly quit? Like just drink one less a day", "4722": "When will you find out?", "4723": "Oh the wait is terrible.  What type of job?", "4724": "Oh no! That is not good! Hopefully you were able to get them out.", "4725": "LOL! I'm sure. Don't be too rough on them.", "4726": "Why couldn't you sleep?", "4727": "I hope so! Why are you stressed?", "4728": "Oh, that sounds uncomfortable. How did you play it?", "4729": "I respect that, I think it shows character and honor. I'm hoping something rewarding comes your way.", "4730": "Oh geez, thats not good.  Was he bothering anyone?", "4731": "I dont blame you.  I probably would have done the same thing.", "4732": "I remember that feeling with my daughter, it is indescribable.", "4733": "There is nothing to compare it to. I wish I hadn't been waking from anesthesia in that moment so I could have been more awake.", "4734": "Oh no! It happens to the best of us :) Have you talked to her about it when you remembered?", "4735": "Awww I'm sure she completely understood and really appreciated you reaching out and going to visit her!", "4736": "Oh, how cool! Dd you and your dad play together?", "4737": "That's great. It'll be wonderful to relive those happy moments in the present maybe with your family.", "4738": "Wow, that is scary. Were you nervous?", "4739": "It sounds like a great experience!", "4740": "How did you feel when he gave it away?", "4741": "Yeah I would have been too. As a nine year old kid that's hard to deal with.", "4742": "Ouch! Was it a serious fall?", "4743": "That's a relatively quick recovery, fortunately.", "4744": "Oh my.. that must have been very sad. I can't even imagine how you must have felt.", "4745": "I'm so sorry.! But I'm really glad you've got those pleasant memories and the memento to hold on to so you can remember her fondly.", "4746": "Wow that's great, you must have put a lot of work into your yard.", "4747": "Cool, I guess the grass is actually greener in your yard now!", "4748": "Ooh nice. That does sound like alot of fun. Do you guys play any sport while your there?", "4749": "Cool. Well enjoy, I hope the weather hold up.", "4750": "Yeah, I haven't seen my friends in forever. We don't even live in the same state anymore.", "4751": "I understand that feeling. I've had trouble letting go of those kind of cravings too. Has your diet been going well otherwise?", "4752": "Wow, congratulations! Sugar is one of the hardest things to kick, I don't have the knack for it either, but still you're making great progress!", "4753": "Oh no!  It always seems like things get lost when you move doesn't it?  Is there anyway you can go back and see if its at your old place?", "4754": "It will probably be where you least expect it!", "4755": "Oh wow.  How did she do?", "4756": "That's awesome!  That's great exercise!", "4757": "Oh, no! That's so terrible!", "4758": "I'm so sorry that happened! I'm glad she's okay, though.", "4759": "That is a great sister. I'm sorry you were feeling down", "4760": "I am glad you are feeling better now", "4761": "That must've been scary! Did you freak out?", "4762": "Oh no. I'm sorry to hear that. At least you both survived the flight.", "4763": "Oh I bet you were pretty upset. Did you guys reschedule?", "4764": "Haha good! I'm glad that one went well.", "4765": "It's always nice to visit home. Did your parents enjoy your visit?", "4766": "Ha ha! I bet. Dogs are the best. I bet he missed you just as much as they did.", "4767": "What makes you want to get softer wheels? Are those harder to skateboard on?", "4768": "I didn't know that about softer wheels! Maybe in the future you can change to those.", "4769": "Oh neat!  How did the little one handle it?", "4770": "Oh no!  Poor baby must have been really stressed out.", "4771": "Oh no!  Hopefully its just the flu.  What did they say?", "4772": "That's good!  I hope she gets to feeling better soon.  The flu is no fun.", "4773": "Congratulations! I bet she is excited and hopefully you are excited for her.", "4774": "Oooo!!! That is so awesome! Will you be in her wedding party?", "4775": "I love kitten, but I can't have one where I live. I bet it is so cute", "4776": "Do you plan on getting one", "4777": "oh man. i hate that. we've had some pretty nasty storms come through Austin in the last few months and luckily i've managed to be in some random parking garage out shopping or eating when they've rolled through.", "4778": "lol. well that's no good. cleaning garages bites.", "4779": "i guess in your field of work you would run across terms and methods which are unfamiliar", "4780": "you'll find some like that, not much you can do", "4781": "How long did it take you to get your promotion?", "4782": "I bet that your bosses will give you the long over promotion. I will keep my fingers crossed for you. Good luck!", "4783": "That's wonderful! Do you have a charity in mind yet?", "4784": "I bet it will feel amazing to have them cheering you on! I have a feeling you'll do great in your race.", "4785": "That's wonderful! Where are you guys going to go?", "4786": "I'm glad you guys had a good time. Are you planning another trip?", "4787": "Where is it that you go to go home?", "4788": "That's awesome. I love going back to my hometown to visit as well.

But it's also important to move forward.", "4797": "oh that is so wrong. How are you handling it?", "4798": "that's good you do that, I would be very frustrated too. That's really unfair. Can you pursue legal charges?", "4799": "Oh I bet that was fun. What kind of dog do you have?", "4800": "My husband was gone all weekend buying us a new puppy, so I understand feeling lonely!", "4801": "Ugh, I bet that is really frustrating.

What's his prognosis?", "4806": "Hopefully medical technology will catch up to where it needs to be for him.", "4807": "Oh no! I used to be a financial advisor so I'm sure that was frustrating. I hope you didn't lose too much money!", "4808": "As much as I hate they didn't go up in price for you, I'm so happy that you didn't overdo it.", "4809": "Oh yuck! I'm sorry that that happened. What kind of dog is he? Is he sick?", "4810": "Hopefully it was just a bad day for him and he won't do it again! I have a couple rescue mutts as well.", "4811": "That's great! Do you get a chance to learn new languages often?", "4812": "My ex programs for insurance companies and they all use the same, ancient language for their statistics.

Hopefully they regret what they did and are able to learn something from this.", "4967": "I enjoyed highschool, too.", "4968": "College was pretty laid back for me, I did a lot of online classes.", "4969": "I am sorry for your loss. I hope you can find comfort during this difficult time.", "4970": "You will, and that is what gives us the strength to face tomorrow!", "4971": "Happens to everybody. My girlfriend, who is the smartest person I know, has had to make 5 duplicates of her car keys because she's locked herself out so much. She's so forgetful because she's so efficient and on top of everything else important, that sometimes she misses the small things. Maybe that's true in your case, too!", "4972": "I've heard some people place theirs in a bowl near the front door as soon as they come home, or they stick it in the fridge with their lunch.. silly things to make sure they can keep it together.", "4973": "Wow. That must be a very special friend. I net you were surprised.", "4974": "Oh dear. Maybe he is a loner and doesn't like friends.", "4975": "oh that's just a recipe for disaster 100% of the time.", "4976": "mine has too. i think you did the right thing by not getting involved.", "4977": "Hm, who might that be?", "4978": "Thats neat. You must trust him a lot given his track record of making money!", "4979": "Oh my goodness!  That's amazing!  Congratulations! Was it your first gold medal race?", "4980": "That is awesome! It is for running?", "4981": "That sounds exciting and scary.  What was the surprise?", "4982": "That is so awesome.  Did you have fun? and more important, are you a pilot now?", "4983": "That's cool, did it bring back some good memories?", "4984": "I love the 90's also, best decade in my opinion!", "4985": "Oh no, did you get hurt?", "4986": "Yikes, I'm sorry to hear that.  That sounds horrifying!", "4987": "So what did you do?", "4988": "Well, I bet your friend had a good time with you being there. Sometimes we have to make sacrefices for those we care about.", "4989": "I'm sorry. My wife could sympathize with you since I'm gone a lot on business as well.", "4990": "I'm sorry you feel lonely.  My wife says she ofens feels the same way.  I know your husband misses you awfully while he's away.  I love having chats with my wife every day when I'm gone.", "4991": "Just be confident and you will do great!", "4992": "You got this!", "4993": "Ah, yeah moving can be hectic! Are you moving somewhere you want to be?", "4994": "That's a positive at least, good luck on the move!", "4995": "Oh no!!! Did you see what happened to the dog?!", "4996": "That's so sad! What on earth is a dog doing around a highway?! That just breaks my heart..", "4997": "I can understand the anxiety. Its a whole new different experience for first timers!", "4998": "Same thing happens to me. I sometimes faint at the sight of a needle! Its good that your experience went well! Now you wont be nervous anymore.", "4999": "Aww! That is so cute! Has he done something special this week that made him extra sweet?", "5000": "That is so sweet of him. Its definitely the little things.", "5001": "Good! What's been going on?", "5002": "Woo! Congrats on that! That's always a nice surprise. What do you do?", "5003": "Yeah exactly!  Music is awesome.", "5004": "Yeah he sounds amazing.  Sorry for your loss friend :(", "5005": "Never too old or too manly to snuggle a stuffed animal. My mom said I used to carry this blanket with me when I was a toddler, everywhere I went. I wish I still had it. If I did, I'd consider using it again, or at the very least passing it down to my own kid. What's the harm, you know? If something gives you comfort and doesn't bother anyone else, there should be no shame.", "5006": "Well, if I were you, I'd keep it up, whether or not my spouse laughed at me, or a new girlfriend/boyfriend, whatever. It's not childish to me. Life is stressful enough. Let us snuggle what we want.", "5007": "Aw! That's horrible, I'm sorry to hear that.", "5008": "That's so sad, I don't even know what to say!", "5009": "Oh no! That is really creepy, why is he in your backyard?", "5010": "Yeah, that's illegal I think, they need to at least knock or ring the door bell!", "5011": "I am so sorry to hear that. It can't be easy for you and your family.", "5012": "No doubt it will take time to process. I wish your family the best. Stay strong my friend.", "5013": "What shows are your favorite? That must be nice.", "5014": "Must be nice, got any nice snacks?", "5015": "Good choice. You're health is more important than some grad degree.", "5016": "I think nowadays employers just want experience. So it should be easier once you have that.", "5017": "Ah, I hate when that happens! How embarrassed were you?", "5018": "Sorry to hear that. Hopefully you're not seriously hurt!", "5019": "You're sweet, what kind of soup did you make him?", "5020": "I love chicken noodle, he must be so grateful.", "5021": "I bet that was a little embarrassing.", "5022": "I am sure it was not as bad as you think.", "5023": "Wow! What kind of meeting is it?", "5024": "Dang! I hope you have successful meeting then!", "5025": "Oh no, was it romantic texts?", "5026": "That's sad. I hope you are OK.", "5027": "That must be weird to talk to your ex still.", "5028": "You must have feelings for him that are lingering.", "5029": "Nice! It feels good to be confident. When do they come out?", "5030": "As you should. You must have good teachers too!", "5031": "why? what happened to it? is it okay?", "5032": "that sounds terrible, i hope you didn't cry alot.", "5033": "Oh yeah?  Do you know someone that lives there?", "5034": "Yeah.  That's awesome that you do that though.  Makes for some special moments with your daughter and teaches her stuff.", "5035": "That sounds cool!  I bet she cooks good!", "5036": "haha same here!", "5037": "I am so happy for you that you have someone you can trust so completely.", "5038": "Hopefully she knows how much this means to you.", "5039": "DID HE GET ACCEPTED? I HOPE SO", "5040": "OMG that's amazing, good on him! you must be so proud", "5041": "oh wow, how did your mother handle this, how did you handle it . i can only imagine the pain.", "5042": "that is really painful, i hope everything becomes better soon.", "5043": "where did he go study at? i can imagine how hard that could be. but it's good to see him following his dreams\\", "5044": "aerospace engineer that sounds very interesting. hopefully he will stay focused and reach his goals.", "5045": "aww that's amazing, i am going on vacation next week and i can't wait", "5046": "i know! i am sure you were able to recharge your batteries", "5047": "Do you have any special welcome-back events planned?", "5048": "That sounds great. Does he travel often?", "5049": "How exciting! I hope everything goes as planned!", "5050": "Sounds like you have a good relationship. I hope when I get married it turns out just as good.", "5051": "aww. im sure you must feel proud of him", "5052": "that sounds so cute", "5053": "that is good news. its always good when what you learn helps you get ahead", "5054": "i hope you do well and excell", "5055": "An adult did this?", "5056": "I dont get people sometimes. Who does that that sort of thing.", "5057": "Aww, they grow up so fast!!  How did she do?", "5058": "haha, I'm sorry you were so upset for nothing!  But it's so great that she loves school.  I hope she loves learning her whole life.", "5059": "What went wrong?", "5060": "That is all that matters, its about the love.", "5061": "I understand. Did you told your friend?", "5062": "Wow, it is terrible.", "5063": "Did you go see who it was?", "5064": "No that's scary stuff.", "5065": "That is great. What is it fun?", "5066": "That is always difficult.", "5067": "I am single and never been married. I assume arguments are part of marriage.", "5068": "Im bad at giving advice especially to people I dont know. Im the opposite. Im too mellow. And that sometimes gets me in trouble.", "5069": "In some ways that is a bit funny but it certainly can be a scary time to come home alone to an empty dark house.", "5070": "I hope you aren't still scared of your shadow?", "5071": "I don't think you should feel too bad about missing one day!  It sounds like you're generous regularly.  I get it though.", "5072": "It's hard to see people and not be able to help.  You seem really giving!", "5073": "Children are a beautiful thing for us parents. What a great memory you have of that.", "5074": "Thats perfect, a boy and a girl thats what most people want. congrats.", "5075": "In what do you believe?", "5076": "That is great. In what do your colleagues believe?", "5077": "What car did you buy?", "5078": "Jeez. Where do you live? I dont remember any state Ive been to with bad drivers.", "5079": "Good luck! My sister-in-law has been with weight watchers for a while now. She loves the camaraderie and how everyone encourages each other.", "5080": "You'll reach your goal. You just have to make small adjustments which'll sustain you throughout your life. How many meetings do you attend?", "5081": "That test seems so hard. I probably couldn't even pass it. How did you do?", "5082": "I didn't know that. Congratulations. That's so awesome.", "5083": "That must have been nice. I keep cards too.", "5084": "Of course not. There is so much paper in this house. I keep cards, photos, school projects. Everything. We arent here forever", "5085": "I found lots of things to pass down when my grandmother passed. I think they passed down their hoarding to us lol", "5086": "Lol. Me too!!", "5087": "Why was it slippery", "5088": "Oh no, were you okay", "5089": "Oh no. Why are you keeping the secret?", "5090": "Oh it sounds like you are in a difficult situation. I hope you can get out of the middle of it!", "5091": "Oh I am sorry. Did you get any part?", "5092": "I am glad you got a good part. I am sure it is a let down to not get what you were hoping for though.", "5093": "That is wonderful, I imagine she is very excited.", "5094": "Okay i see well, take your time she will be getting her liscense soon", "5095": "She just needs to get her confidence and I am sure you are a great teacher.", "5096": "It will definitely paid off and I am rooting for her.", "5097": "That can be overwhelming. Are you going to be cleaning all day then?", "5098": "I'm sure you will get it done!", "5099": "Thats neat. Do you guys make a lot of money?", "5100": "I wish my siblings were like that. We should be more supportive and close like that", "5101": "I am jealous lol", "5102": "I will work on it with my family.", "5103": "Wow!  It sounds like your kid is quite smart and gifted!  You must be really proud of him!", "5104": "Man, that is amazing that both your kids are so talented.  I hope my little ones are like that.  Congrats on your great parenting!", "5105": "Are you able to learn the route first before you have to take it for your job or are they kind of just throwing you into it?", "5106": "Well hopefully you're able to familiarize yourself quickly. Good luck!", "5107": "Thats sad. Have you been to Scotand since?", "5108": "Im sorry to hear that. Were you born there?", "5109": "96! Wow. Thats a full life!", "5110": "Wow. She probably couldve kept going for years if it wasnt for that.", "5111": "Excellent! Are you enjoying it?", "5112": "Sick. I hope it's as fun as it looks!", "5113": "I am glad that she is living close to you. That must make you feel special. My mom is dead so I understand how you feel.", "5114": "I am happy that your mom is still around. Cherish the days that you spend together.", "5115": "are they typically bad or something?", "5116": "Oh that makes sense, well enjoy the peace and quiet!", "5117": "Thats awesome. What did you guys do?", "5118": "that sounds fun!", "5119": "Poor thing! What did you do?   Did you take it home with you?", "5120": "eww,  that is great you took such great care of him.", "5121": "That 's nice of you.  Did you keep it as a pet", "5122": "Cool.  Some birds shouldn't be in captivity.  What kind of bird was it", "5123": "That is a nerve-racking experience. But I'm betting you did graduate and did just fine!", "5124": "Congratulations! Waiting for results can be very stressful - everything's out of your hands and all you can do is wait.", "5125": "I'm sure she understands, just tell the truth!", "5126": "Yeah, I'd be pretty scared too, but it's better to be upfront about it to get it off your chest", "5127": "Oh boy. Did you not get the memo that you were supposed to be wearing a dress?", "5128": "Everyone looks good in a dress. Just make sure to shave first.", "5129": "Oh man, I did too.  I still do every once in a while but only when I'm having trouble sleeping.  Does one stand out from the rest that you remember vividly?", "5130": "Creepy! I once had a dream of a Lion laying at the end of my bad. It was scary but also comforting.  I feel like I could've touched it. Glad you're free of those dreams now.", "5131": "So you probably felt pretty guilty huh. Did you return what you stole?", "5132": "Glad to hear you stopped with your wayward habits before the Po Po caught up with you!", "5133": "I've always liked the idea of meditation, but I feel like it'd be hard. My mind is always racing!", "5134": "Awesome, I'll check that out! I hear all sorts of great things about meditation.", "5135": "Me too, do you have any special plans?", "5136": "How fun! yes I am sure they will have  a great time!", "5137": "Is it for college?", "5138": "Well good luck, I hope you get in!", "5139": "I love cooking! What types of things do you like to cook?", "5140": "I am also a vegetarian and I love cooking Italian food.", "5141": "Those are so much fun. Was everyone hype?", "5142": "Tight. Probably wont be able to do that again!", "5143": "Oh my gosh, so tiny. I'm hoping since he was released from the hospital he is doing well now?", "5144": "I can imagine. I'm glad to hear he's better! Life is such a gift.", "5145": "That is really nice that you guys have that trust.", "5146": "That is an awesome goal! Good luck!", "5147": "I hope it didn't mess up your clothes. I'm sure it was a mistake.", "5148": "I'm glad it didn't mess anything up and that your relationship with your sister is still in tact.", "5149": "Oh no. I rent also so I know your pain. My last landlord was awful.  How did your landlord react?", "5150": "Oh good, glad he did that instead of just coming down on your for not paying.  Glad it worked out for you.", "5151": "Lucky you did that in time!", "5152": "Sounds like it worked out great for you!", "5153": "Wow! You should do something back for her!", "5154": "Nice, I am jealous of your friendship!", "5155": "Was it something important that you took ?", "5156": "I see, did they ever find out it was you ?", "5157": "That is awful, I am sorry to hear that.  Is he doing better now?", "5158": "I'm so glad he is better.  Is the whole family doing alright?  I know that can be really hard on people.", "5159": "Life was easier back then, Hopefully you still love life?", "5160": "Nostalgia can stir emotions. You'll find something to love about life again.", "5161": "Oh, no!  What happened?  Did she just get loose?", "5162": "Thankfully, they are both okay.  Dogs or cars, or anything for that matter could get them!", "5163": "What?", "5164": "Congrats! I bet that feels great!", "5165": "That is embarrassing. I would hate to have that happen.", "5166": "That is the best way to handle those situations.", "5167": "Ouch! I can relate. What made you decide to drink a whole gallon in a day?", "5168": "Haha! I hope you experience no seriously ill effects!", "5169": "Sheesh that is brutal, did you smack him?", "5170": "I don't blame you, that is low.", "5171": "Me neither, I hate it when they just wont leave you alone", "5172": "Yes! I feel the same", "5173": "Always try to brush your teeth at least twice a day, it helps", "5174": "If you don't take care of your teeth then you will have a bad time later in life", "5175": "That is bizarre, have you had this seen about?", "5176": "That is odd, are you afraid when you wake up?", "5177": "You sound a lot like my husband. He is really into going to the gym. Life isnt right if he doesnt get gym time.", "5178": "I agree. Its pretty cool to see the changes. I never really got into going to the gym though.", "5179": "I have been skydiving, too! It was a fun experience.", "5180": "I lost my hearing for a few hours after though, but other than that it was a wonderful experience.", "5181": "That is great, did something recently happen?", "5182": "Awesome! What type of music?", "5183": "What possibilities do you speak of?", "5184": "That sounds pretty exciting.", "5185": "I've never been much for meditating. I'm glad you enjoy it.", "5186": "What got you into meditation?", "5187": "I think that's a good idea so you aren't always dependent on others to have fun and just enjoy time to yourself.", "5188": "Meditation on goals and positive ideas during some of that alone time can be so uplifting and refocuses you.", "5189": "I used to struggle with the same problem, it can be overwhelming", "5190": "I agree!!", "5191": "Grats.  How long have you been working out for?", "5192": "Keep your diet clean and you'll keep improving.", "5193": "That sounds nice. Hopefully it isn't too hot for you.", "5194": "Are you going to be sleeping in a tent?", "5195": "That's just so sad. House fires are terrifying to me.", "5196": "The wiring was probably old and not up to code anymore.", "5197": "did it go flat?", "5198": "that is very fortunate!", "5199": "That is really nice of you!  Is the cat OK now?", "5200": "That's good.  If not for you, who knows what could have happened.  You must be a very caring individual.", "5201": "I think that is a lovely thing", "5202": "If its important, you will figure it out", "5203": "Yea, its a good idea to take time for yourself when you can", "5204": "I think relaxing is very important", "5205": "Yeah as a child it's hard to see other kids with a bunch of friends when you don't have that many.", "5206": "Well, I hope you got over that issue and ended up making lots of friends yourself.", "5207": "Oh man! thats impressive, those baths are rough.", "5208": "That's good. But still! You must be pretty tough!", "5209": "Are you taking protein?", "5210": "That is good, hopefully it helps!", "5211": "I agree, were you recently screwed by one?", "5212": "Yep its disgusting", "5213": "That is sweet of you, kids are cute", "5214": "Oh that is not good, I hope you were able to clean it up easily...", "5215": "Wow I haven't thought of them in years.  Sometimes it is good to have bands you can always go back to", "5216": "True.  I have favorite bands to that I consider to be musical comfort food", "5217": "Nice! Are you getting a car soon too?", "5218": "Definitely, especially when you get really hungry at night. I love a good drive thru", "5219": "That is awful. I've had it happen to me once before.", "5220": "I sure hope so, too! It is a lot of work to get it sorted out.", "5221": "Yeah... that seems like a hard gig, especially in today's day and age, where everyone's so wary, and especially since there's not often people at home during the day. You have to have good people skills to do that job, though. So, you at least probably have that going for you.", "5222": "Ah.. yeah, I'm sorry you had to run into that kind of problem. It's hard doing a job you don't agree with the ethics of. There's really no way to fake it sometimes. But at least you were able to realize that and stand by your morals.", "5223": "Is he going out drinking?", "5224": "That is such a tough time, my son is teething as well", "5225": "Well I am not a religious person but I will have to say it urks me when I am surronded my religious people that is trying to push their belief on me. Then seeing them feel people heads with stuff that they can not prove is there irritates me also", "5226": "Lol. exactly how I feel", "5227": "Oh, thats not unusual. You must try to relax. Is it an important presentation?", "5228": "I see, I hope it goes well for you. Remember to breathe!", "5229": "That is a scary situation. People do not care anymore.", "5230": "You are so right!", "5231": "That is awesome, what degree are you working towards?", "5232": "I can imagine, waiting sucks!", "5233": "That's kind of odd. I probably would have tried to take a swing just out of pure instinct. What was the reason they wanted to wake you up?", "5234": "Hahaha.. that's kind of goofy in a way. Yeah, sometimes nothing good can come of people trying to get your attention randomly in the middle of the night. That's probably the wisest choice. I probably wouldn't be able to act that good enough to pull it off.", "5235": "Ouch!  What did you take?", "5236": "Was it an awesome keyboard worth getting in trouble for?", "5237": "Congrats! Thats so exciting do You fel ok?", "5238": "YAY! good job! He/she is going to be beautiful", "5239": "I still think it is, i always get so excited", "5240": "yep thats one of the things that make it so nice", "5241": "Oh wow that is weird. Did you say anything to him?", "5242": "Yeesh, how awkward is that.", "5243": "Were you able to take the plate id?", "5244": "I understand. Sorry to hear about that.", "5245": "Oh nice. What kind of candy was it?", "5246": "Oh yeah I think I have tried that one! I love anything by Haribro!", "5247": "Glad to hear it. I hate hearing about children having tragic childhoods and not being able to just simply be a kid. But at least she'll have a good perspective and appreciate life more.", "5248": "Even if she does, it will help make her a well-rounded, relatable person. Usually these things help ground kids and give them character. But maybe you're right, if she moves on from it quickly, that's great too!", "5249": "What had he made in the world?", "5250": "That's super cool, I played a few years back but eventually quit.", "5251": "I am really sorry to hear that.  I hope everything is alright.", "5252": "Well, that is just terrible.  I hate it when companies jerk you around like that.  I hope you will be able to reschedule it, although I know that wouldn't make up for the frustration.", "5253": "that is a great way to look at it", "5254": "Yeah more people should look at life like you do"}}
