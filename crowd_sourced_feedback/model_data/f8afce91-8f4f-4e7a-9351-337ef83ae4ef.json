That makes sense. It must have been fun to remember all the old stuff from your childhood.", "179": "Yes, I'm 32 so I was a child in the 80s. It's so funny to look back and remember all the stuff we used to do.", "180": "That must be really hard for you. It's so unfair that people have to put up with bullies in any situation. Have you ever experienced bullying yourself?", "181": "Yes, I found several online communities that were focused on learning and making friends.

It's always nice when you have a pleasant surprise. Did you enjoy it?", "183": "Ha! I definitely wouldn't. It was really bad.

Have you talked to them about it?", "186": "That's really frustrating! It's disrespectful and unprofessional to leave a mess for someone else to clean up.

Maybe you can talk to her and explain why you got rid of the necklace and apologize for hurting her feelings.", "211": "That is sweet. It's nice that she wants to pass it on to your daughter. It's a nice gesture. Do you think you'll keep it now?", "212": "Yes, I totally understand what you mean. Music has a way of transporting us to different times and places, doesn't it? It's almost like a time machine. What kind of song was it that took you back?", "213": "No, I get that. It can be nice to reminisce but it's also nice to be in the present.

Is there anything you learned from the experience?", "220": "That sounds like it must have been really scary! How are you feeling about it now?", "221": "That's understandable. I'm glad you were able to laugh it off in the end. Pranks can be funny, but they can also be very upsetting.", "222": "I'm so sorry to hear that. It must be difficult to go through this. Have you talked to anyone about it? It can be helpful to talk to friends and family about what you're going through.", "223": "I understand. It sounds like a difficult decision. Have you talked to anyone about it? It can be helpful to talk to a friend or family member about what you're going through.", "224": "That's understandable.

Could you please explain it to me?", "233": "I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?", "234": "Oh no, that must have been really frightening for you. What happened after you heard the gunshots?", "235": "That's horrible. I'm glad you're safe. Is there anything I can do to help you feel better?", "236": "Yes, I do. It's one of my favorite things to do when the weather gets cold. It's so cozy and comforting.", "237": "That sounds like a great idea! I will definitely keep that in mind the next time I get a cold front. Thanks for the suggestion!", "238": "That's really sweet. It sounds like you really appreciate all she does for you.

What kind of music do you like?", "388": "That's a bit of a sweeping statement, don't you think? I'm sure there are plenty of great songs and bands out there, you just have to look for them. What kind of music do you like? Maybe I can recommend something for you to listen to. ", "389": "That's great! How long have you been waiting for it?", "390": "That sounds like a great game!

Have you tried practicing in an empty parking lot or with someone experienced?", "396": "Yes, it can be intimidating at first. But with practice, you'll get the hang of it.

What is it like?", "417": "That sounds really scary. I'm sorry you had to go through that. Is there anything I can do to help?", "418": "No, I haven't. Have you?", "419": "That's really cool!

It's always nice to see someone rewarded for their hard work and dedication.", "426": "That's really unfortunate. It's hard to find a job in this economy. I'm glad she was able to find one with better pay, though. That's a silver lining.", "427": "That sounds like it was a really sweet surprise! How is the puppy doing?", "428": "A German Shepherd, that's awesome! How's the puppy been doing?", "429": "That must have been a difficult situation to be in.

Was this a trip you had been looking forward to for a while?", "436": "Wow, that must have been really stressful. Did you manage to reschedule the trip?", "437": "That was a wise decision.

How did it make you feel?", "444": "I'm sorry to hear that. How did that make you feel?", "445": "That's understandable, but it's still not okay to take something that doesn't belong to you. Have you talked to your friend about it?", "446": "I'm sorry to hear that. That must have been difficult for you. Is there anything I can do to help you feel better?", "447": "That sounds like a good way to take your mind off things.

Did you have any coping strategies for dealing with the fear?", "477": "Yeah, I can totally understand that. It's scary to think about something like that happening and not having a safe place to go.

It's so important to stay level-headed in times of fear.", "479": "That must be really hard for you. It's understandable that you would feel bad about it. Is there anything you can do to help make things better going forward?", "480": "That's a great way to use it as a teaching moment.

Have you ever noticed that it's usually like that on the weekends?", "491": "That's so frustrating! It's like they think they own the place or something. Is there a grocery store near you that is less crowded? That might help you avoid the rush.", "492": "I'm sorry to hear that.

You should be proud of yourself for all the hard work you put in. How do you feel now that you've passed?", "502": "That's great news! Babies usually fly for free. Did you know that before you started the booking process? ", "503": "That sounds great! What do you have in mind?", "504": "I'm so sorry to hear that. That must have been really hurtful for you. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?", "505": "I understand. It's not easy to be in a relationship when someone doesn't understand your feelings. Have you talked to him about it?", "506": "That must have been really scary for you. How did you manage to get through it?", "507": "I understand how you feel. It is natural to feel scared after such an experience. But, focus on the fact that you have taken all the necessary safety precautions and have learnt all the rules of the road, so you can be a safe driver. Take it slow and easy until you are confident.", "508": "That sounds like an interesting project! How did you go about it? ", "509": "That's awesome! How have they been doing? Have you seen any progress?", "510": "That's great! What do you like to make with them?", "511": "Yeah, I've noticed that too. It seems like the roads are just so congested. Have you been able to find any good routes to avoid the traffic?", "512": "It's so frustrating when you're trying to get somewhere and you're stuck in traffic. It's like everyone is in a rush but going nowhere.", "513": "Wow, that's really cool! How did it go?", "514": "Mostly through gaming forums and chat rooms. We'd talk about the games we were playing and eventually started playing together. It's been great to have a group of people I can rely on for support and friendship. That's awesome that you got married! How long have you been married? ", "515": "That's really admirable of you! It's great that you care for everyone. Is there anything I can do to help?", "516": "Thank you, I try my best!", "517": "That sounds like it was a bit of a shock. How have you been feeling since then?", "518": "That's understandable. Have you tried talking to her online or on the phone?", "519": "That's incredible! It's so inspiring to hear that she was able to achieve her goal without the traditional route. What an amazing accomplishment for her!", "520": "That's true. It's great that she was able to find a job that she loves and that recognizes her skills and abilities.", "521": "That must be so frustrating. Is there anything you can do to help her understand that she should only go outside?", "522": "It sounds like she may not have enough time to do her business outside. Have you tried taking her out for longer walks? That might help her get it all out before she comes back in.", "523": "That's wonderful! It's great to hear that you find such joy and fulfillment in your relationship. What do you think makes him such a great partner?", "524": "That's really sweet. Tell me more about why you think being with him makes you a better person.", "525": "I understand. It can be really unsettling when you're not around to take care of things.

What is it about your life that you love?", "528": "That sounds like an ideal situation. What do you enjoy doing most when you have free time?", "529": "Yes, that's definitely a plus. Working from home can be really isolating though. Do you have good ways to stay connected to people?", "530": "Wow, that must have been a surprise! How did you feel when you saw them all there?", "531": "Wow, that's great! I'm glad your friends care enough to surprise you like that. It was really thoughtful of them.", "532": "No, it's not. Is there anything I can do to help?", "533": "That sounds really difficult. Is there any way you can make it up to her?", "534": "Oh wow, what did you like most about it?", "535": "My favorite thing about San Antonio is the Riverwalk. It's a great place to take a stroll and enjoy the scenery.", "536": "Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations on your accomplishment! How does it feel to be the top of your class?", "537": "That is amazing! You must be so proud of yourself. Congratulations!", "538": "That sounds really unpleasant. Is he okay now?", "539": "That's too bad. Is he feeling better now?", "540": "Oh no! That must have been so painful. Is your foot okay? Is there anything I can do to help?", "541": "It's understandable that you were mad. Kids don't always remember to pick up after themselves. Is there anything I can do to help?", "542": "That sounds like a really nice treat for her! I'm sure she enjoyed it. Have you been able to eat there recently?", "543": "That's awesome! I'm so glad she got to enjoy some delicious Qdoba. Did she like it?", "544": "Wow, that is really impressive! How did you feel when you saw it?", "545": "That's amazing!

He must be really talented.", "548": "Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations! It sounds like you must be so proud of him.", "549": "That must have made you feel really proud.", "550": "That sounds really uncomfortable. It's hard to feel like you're not connecting with an audience. Did you have any ideas on how to handle the situation better? ", "551": "That is a bummer, maybe the timing was off or it just wasn't the right crowd for the joke.  You could always try a different story or joke next time. ", "552": "That must be really hard! Are you able to stay in touch with her while she's away?", "553": "Yes, you should! I'm sure there are plenty of dog parks in your area. You can do a quick search online to find out which ones are closest to you.", "554": "That's so kind of him! How did you react?", "555": "That's really thoughtful of him. Maybe he just wanted to be friendly?", "556": "That sounds really irritating. Is there anything you can do to try to help make the situation better? Have you talked to your neighbor about it?", "557": "I can understand how frustrating that must be. Have you tried talking to your neighbor about it?", "558": "Oh no, that sounds really difficult. Can you tell me more about the call? What happened?", "559": "I understand. It's understandable to feel worried. Is there anything I can do to help?", "560": "That sounds like a great picture! It's understandable that you miss your friends and want to hang out with them again. What are some ways you can stay connected with them? Maybe you can plan a virtual hangout or send them a message to catch up.", "561": "That must be hard. Do you miss them a lot?", "562": "I'm so sorry to hear that. It must be hard for you to have to go through this every year. Is there anything I can do to help you through this tough time?", "563": "You're welcome.

What did you do to make the money?", "571": "That's great to hear. I'm glad you were able to make enough to pay them.", "572": "That's wonderful! It's so great to have friends who are like angels to us. What has your friend done for you lately that has made you so happy?", "573": "That's amazing! I'm so glad you have each other to lean on. How do you help each other through tough times?", "574": "I'm sorry to hear that. How did you decide to punish him?", "575": "It sounds like you want to help him understand the importance of friendship. What kind of punishment did you give him?", "576": "I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling so frustrated. It can be really discouraging to compare yourself to someone else's success. Have you been looking for jobs and trying to make progress in your career?", "577": "It's definitely hard, but it's important to remember that you have your own unique path and you should focus on that. It's okay to be inspired by others, but don't let it get you down. Everyone has their own challenges to face.", "578": "That's great to hear! How did it go?", "579": "That's great to hear! I'm sure you'll get it. Do you know when you might hear back?", "580": "That sounds like a really nice memory! What was it like to see it again after all these years?", "581": "That's really sweet of you. I'm sure it feels good to have it back in your life.", "582": "What do you mean?", "583": "I can see why that would be concerning. What would you like to see parents prioritize more?", "584": "That's so kind of you! What a sweet thing to do for the little guy. Do you plan on keeping him?", "585": "That's a great name! How old is Alphy?", "586": "It sounds like it can be really challenging. Is there anything I can do to help?", "587": "It's hard to let go and trust that they can handle it. It's natural to want to help, but you also want them to learn how to problem solve on their own.", "588": "That's amazing! Congratulations! How do you feel about it?", "589": "That's really great! Congratulations to her. I'm sure she worked really hard to get this job.", "590": "Oh no, that sounds so difficult. How is he doing now?", "591": "That's so sweet of you. I'm glad he's getting better.", "592": "It's understandable that you feel bad. Maybe you can make it up to her by doing something special for her? It sounds like you really care about her and want to make it up to her.", "593": "Well, it's up to you. If you think she'd appreciate the honesty, then go for it. If you think it would just make her mad, then maybe it's better to just get her another one and keep it to yourself.", "594": "That's really unfair. It must have been so frustrating to be blamed for something you didn't do. Is there anything I can do to help?", "595": "That's really unfair. Is there anything you can do to make sure it doesn't happen again?", "596": "That sounds amazing! Alaska is such a beautiful place. Have you been there before?", "597": "That's understandable. Have you ever been on a boat before?", "598": "Wow, she must have been a very special person. Tell me more about her.", "599": "I'm so sorry for your loss. Is there anything I can do to help you?", "600": "That sounds really frightening. Did you witness it firsthand?", "601": "Oh wow, that must have been pretty scary to witness.

Is there anything else you can do to make it up to her? Maybe a card or a nice gesture?", "608": "That sounds exciting! Did you find out what the award was for?", "609": "That's great! How long have you been working towards this goal?", "610": "Thank you! I'm really excited, but I'm also a bit nervous. I'm sure I'll do well, though. I'm looking forward to the challenge!", "611": "That's reassuring. Thanks for your support!", "612": "It's totally normal to be nervous during a job interview. It's a sign that you really care about the outcome and want to do your best. Have you tried any relaxation techniques to help calm your nerves?", "613": "Yes, I have. It can be intimidating, but it is also a great way to get a better sense of the company culture. How did you find the experience?", "614": "It sounds like you're struggling with feeling like you're not a good parent. It's hard when we don't feel like we're living up to our own expectations. Is there anything I can do to help?", "615": "That must have been so unpleasant. It sounds like you handled the situation well though.", "616": "That must be really frustrating. Is there anyone in particular you feel like isn't listening?", "617": "I can understand why that would be so frustrating. Have you tried expressing your feelings to them in a different way? Maybe if you explain how you feel in a different way, they'll be more likely to listen.", "618": "That must be really hard for you. What do you miss most about the time you used to spend together?", "619": "That sounds like a great time! It's so important to make sure you have quality time together, even if it's limited.", "620": "That sounds great! Where are you going?", "621": "That sounds like a great trip! What parks are you planning to visit?", "622": "Oh no! That sounds like a lot of extra work for you. Did you manage to get her clean again?", "623": "I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to help?", "624": "That sounds so cozy and relaxing! What show are you watching?", "625": "That sounds like a great plan. I hope you have a restful sleep!", "626": "That must have been really tough! What did you do to prepare for it?", "627": "That sounds like a great opportunity.

Is there anything else I can do for you?", "632": "You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with?", "633": "Are you sure? Is there anything I can do to help you?", "634": "That sounds like a great idea! What kind of plants are you going to be growing?", "635": "You're welcome. Is there anything I can do to help you out with your gardening?", "636": "That must have been really frustrating. Can you tell me more about what happened?", "637": "That's really unfair. Did you manage to get the item you wanted in the end?", "638": "I'm sure they will. It sounds like you're taking the right steps to get the situation resolved.", "639": "Why were you so upset? Can I help in any way?", "640": "That sounds really difficult. What made you feel better after going to the store?", "641": "That's wonderful! What happened that made you proud?", "642": "That's wonderful! What did he do that made you proud?", "643": "That must be tough. Is there anyone else you can talk to?", "644": "That must have been so lonely. Did you miss having someone to talk to?", "645": "That sounds like a great plan! Where are you planning to go?", "646": "I'm sure it will be! Is there anything I can do to help make the trip easier?", "647": "That sounds great! It must be nice to have so many amenities right at your fingertips. Do you live in a complex or a single family home?", "648": "That must be great for you, having all of these amenities to yourself.

It is not easy to maintain a long-term relationship, but it is clear that you have both put in the effort to make it work.", "659": "That's understandable. It's normal to feel a bit jealous when someone close to us has something that we don't. Is there anything you can do to make yourself feel better? Maybe you can go out and get something that you've been wanting for a while?", "660": "That's the spirit! It's great that you're setting goals for yourself. What can you do to make it happen?", "661": "That's great to hear! What do you have planned for today? Do you have any exciting activities lined up?", "662": "That is a great outlook to have.

How long has she been singing?", "668": "Aww that's so sweet. It's great that you can appreciate her talent and enjoy it with her. Have you encouraged her to take any singing lessons or join a choir?", "669": "I'm sorry to hear that. It must be hard for you to come to this realization. Have you been feeling this way for a while?", "670": "It can be hard to have those conversations, but it's important to be honest with him. Is there anything I can do to help make it easier for you?

Is there anything you can do to try to get your neighbors to keep the noise down?", "683": "I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried retracing your steps to see if you can remember where you last had it? Maybe you left it somewhere and it's still there.", "684": "That's understandable. Is there any way you can think of to narrow down the possibilities? Maybe you could look at your phone or calendar to see what places you visited that day, and then you could start there.", "685": "That's great! It must be a really special occasion. How long do you plan to stay with them?", "686": "That must be so exciting for all of you! I'm sure it will be a wonderful visit.

What was the prize?", "788": "Wow, congratulations! That's really impressive. What did you win?", "789": "That sounds really frustrating. Is there anything you can do to try to manage the situation?", "790": "I can understand that. It's hard to be in a situation where you feel like you're not being heard. Have you tried talking to your coworker about it?", "791": "That must be so frustrating! Did you check the tracking information to see if the package has been delivered?", "792": "Yes, it can be difficult to wait, but it will be here soon. Is there something else you can do in the meantime that will help you pass the time?", "793": "Oh no, that sounds really embarrassing and uncomfortable. Are you okay?", "794": "I'm glad to hear that.

Is there anything I can do to help? What would you like to do to make your financial situation better?", "804": "Yes, it's a great way to make some extra money and it's also a great way to build relationships with people.

It's really impressive to watch.", "815": "That must be really difficult for you. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?", "816": "That's a great idea! You could also reach out to the moms you've judged in the past and apologize for your behavior. That would be a great way to start.", "817": "Aww, that must be so hard. Have you tried giving him something cold to chew on? That can help with the pain and discomfort.", "818": "That's understandable. It must be painful for him. Have you tried using a teething ring or cold washcloth to help soothe him?", "819": "Oh no, that sounds really scary! What did you do? ", "820": "That's a relief. Did you talk to the other dog owner?", "821": "Wow, that sounds like a lot of work! How long did it take you to finish potty training your dog? ", "822": "Yes, it can be.

What kind of duties would you be responsible for?", "829": "No, I haven't had to file for disability. Can I ask why you're asking?", "830": "I'm sorry to hear that. What has been the most difficult part of the process?", "831": "Yes, all the time! My kids are always doing something cute that turns annoying. For example, they'll start singing a song that I love and then they won't stop singing it for hours. It's sweet at first, but then it gets really annoying. How about with your kids?", "832": "That sounds really frustrating! It can be hard to find a balance between showing interest and needing a break from hearing about the same thing. Have you tried setting a limit on how much time they can talk to you about the game?", "833": "That must have been difficult. What was that like for you?", "834": "That must be really difficult for you. Is there anything I can do to help?", "835": "That's great that you didn't give up! It sounds like you put a lot of effort into it and it paid off. Congratulations!", "836": "Absolutely! It's so rewarding to see the fruits of our hard work and dedication.

Is there anything I can do to help you feel better?", "843": "That sounds really frustrating. How did you handle it?", "844": "That would definitely help. I'm sure the cashier was working as fast as they could.", "845": "That sounds like so much fun! What kind of puppy did you get?", "846": "Absolutely! It's so wonderful to see the puppy learn new things and explore its new environment. It's like a little miracle every day.", "847": "I understand how you feel. It can be hard to let go of the past. Is there something specific you miss about those days?", "848": "Ah, I understand. It can be hard to deal with all the responsibilities that come with getting older. What was your favorite part of childhood?", "849": "That must have been an amazing feeling! What did you win for?", "850": "That sounds like a really cool project! What did you find out?", "851": "I can imagine how hard this must be for you. Is there anything I can do to help?", "852": "It's definitely hard to hear them cry. I found that setting a consistent sleep routine and sticking to it was really helpful. I also tried to make his bedtime as comforting as possible by reading books, playing soft music, and giving him a nice warm bath. That seemed to help him relax and fall asleep more easily.", "853": "That sounds wonderful! What did you do while you were there?", "854": "I'm glad you were able to enjoy your vacation. It's really important to take time for yourself and get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.", "855": "Yes, it sure does. It's amazing how quickly children grow up.

Aerospace Engineering is a difficult field to break into. I'm sure he has worked hard to get to this point. Congratulations to him and to you for supporting him.", "861": "That's great news! I'm so glad to hear he's on the mend. Is there anything else I can do to help?", "862": "No, I don't have any kids, but I do have a niece and nephew I love very much. How old is your son?", "863": "That sounds like it was a lot of fun! What did you find?", "864": "Haha, sounds like a good haul! Did you get any rare ones?", "865": "Wow, that's so impressive! It's great that she is so helpful and responsible.", "866": "That's so cute! It's great to see her taking initiative and wanting to be rewarded for her hard work.", "867": "Oh no!

It's hard to know what's best for someone else, so it's good that you tried to be understanding.", "876": "What happened?", "877": "Oh no, what happened?", "878": "That must have been really hard for you. It sounds like you're feeling a bit jealous of your friend's seemingly endless vacation opportunities. It's understandable to feel that way. Have you been able to talk to your friend about how you're feeling?", "879": "It's understandable to be jealous of her, but it's also important to remember that everyone has their own struggles and that you don't know what someone else is going through.

Good luck!", "1078": "That must have been a tough situation. How did he react when you told him?", "1079": "That's understandable. It can be hard to tell someone you don't feel the same way.

What do you think could have been done differently to make the most of the time you had together? ", "1106": "I completely understand how frustrating this must be for you. Have you tried talking to her about it?", "1107": "No, it wouldn't. Have you tried talking to your neighbor about it? Maybe you can agree on a time that would be more convenient for both of you. That way, you can both get the sleep you need without having to resort to yelling.", "1108": "Haha, true. Maybe try speaking to them in person when they're not making noise and let them know the impact it's having on you. Make sure to be polite and understanding, and explain that you're not trying to be difficult but you need to get your rest. Hopefully they'll be willing to work with you.

Good luck with the move!", "1539": "I'm so sorry to hear that you were sick. It must have been a difficult time for you and your family. I'm glad to hear that your family was there for you. Is there anything I can do to help you during this recovery process?", "1540": "That's really great to hear. It's wonderful that you have such a loving and supportive family.", "1541": "That is really disheartening. It's hard to understand why people would do that. Have you had a personal experience with this?", "1542": "That sounds really difficult. It's great that you are working towards making a change. Is there anything I can do to help?", "1543": "That must have been a shock. How are you feeling about it?", "1544": "I can understand why you're feeling a bit surprised and left out. It sounds like he's not used to sharing his personal life with others. Have you talked to him about it yet?", "1545": "That sounds really frustrating. Did you do anything to try and de-stress afterwards?", "1546": "It's really frustrating when people don't take driving seriously. It's like they don't realize how dangerous it can be. It's important to be aware of your surroundings and be mindful of other drivers.", "1547": "I'm so sorry to hear that. It must be really tough for them to cope with such a loss. Is there anything I can do to help?", "1548": "I'm so sorry for your loss. It must be really hard for your parents. Is there anything I can do to help or support them?", "1549": "That must be really discouraging. Have you tried reaching out to any hiring managers or recruiters? It can be intimidating, but networking is a great way to get your foot in the door.", "1550": "That's understandable. It can be difficult to find a job when you don't have many connections. Have you tried looking for jobs online or contacting companies directly? That could be a great way to start networking and maybe even get your foot in the door. You could also look into starting a side hustle to make some extra money while you search for a job. What do you think about that?", "1551": "That's wonderful! How old is she?", "1552": "That's great that she has an idea of what she wants to do. What do you think about her choice of becoming a dentist?", "1553": "Wow, that sounds like a lot of work! Is there anything I can do to help you out?", "1554": "Yeah, it sounds like you don't have much time to relax. Is there anything I can do to help you manage your workload? ", "1555": "It sounds like a really thrilling experience! What was it like?", "1556": "That sounds like an incredible experience. Did you do it with a group or alone?", "1557": "Maybe I'll think about it. It's definitely an experience I wouldn't want to miss out on. Have you done it more than once?", "1558": "That's great to hear! What kind of food have you been enjoying?", "1559": "That's great to hear. It sounds like you've found a way to make veganism work for you. Are there any particular recipes you would recommend?", "1560": "That sounds really scary. Is there anything I can do to help you feel better?", "1561": "That must have been a difficult time for you. How did you manage to show your support?", "1562": "That's great to hear! It must have been a difficult time for you and your family, but I'm glad she was able to make a full recovery.", "1563": "I'm sure she does. It's wonderful that you were able to be there for her.", "1564": "Yes, I try to see her at least twice a month. How about you?", "1565": "Wow, that sounds like an awesome car! What did you like about it?", "1566": "Sounds like a really nice car. Did you get a chance to take a closer look?", "1567": "That's so frustrating! Did you have any other pairs of flip flops?", "1568": "It's ok, these things happen. I'm sure you're frustrated, but at least it wasn't something more expensive. Do you think it was an accident or do you think she was trying to get revenge?", "1569": "That sounds like a really sweet gesture! What did she make?", "1570": "That sounds delicious! What was your favorite part of the dinner?", "1571": "My favorite meal is a classic roast dinner with all the trimmings.", "1572": "I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like this has been a difficult experience for you. Is there anything I can do to help?", "1573": "I know it's hard, but try to focus on the positive aspects of the situation. Maybe it's a chance to start fresh and take some time to focus on yourself. It's ok to feel sad but try to find something to look forward to in the future.", "1574": "That sounds like it was really nice of him. What did he make for dinner?", "1575": "That sounds delicious! I'm sure it was a wonderful experience to spend the day with your grandfather and enjoy a home cooked meal.", "1576": "Congratulations! That's great news. How does it feel to be promoted?", "1577": "That's awesome! I'm sure all your hard work has paid off. What do you think will be the biggest challenge in your new role?", "1578": "That's so wonderful! What kind of words is she saying?", "1579": "No, I don't have children yet. But I'm looking forward to that day when I do. It sounds like you're really enjoying the experience of watching your daughter grow and learn.", "1580": "That's great! You must be really excited. Have you decided on a destination yet?", "1581": "That sounds amazing! What are you most looking forward to?", "1582": "That sounds like a really nice way to celebrate! What did you have?", "1583": "That sounds like a great way to celebrate! Did you get a special dessert?", "1584": "Wow, that sounds like a really nice birthday dinner. Did you have any dessert?", "1585": "That sounds like so much fun! How was the ride?", "1586": "Yes, I do. I love going for walks in the park near my house, especially in the spring when the flowers are in bloom. It's so peaceful and calming.", "1587": "That sounds really lonely. Is there any way you can connect with them, even if it's just for a few minutes?", "1588": "That must be really hard. I'm sorry to hear that. Have you been able to visit them recently? Or do you have any other friends nearby that you can spend time with?", "1589": "That sounds like a great way to approach life! What were some of your experiences like?", "1590": "That's wonderful to hear. It's great that you're taking the time to enjoy life and explore.", "1591": "That's really tough. Is there any way you can make the most of the situation? Maybe you can take him out for a nice dinner or plan a fun activity you can do together. It sounds like you're feeling a bit envious, but it can be a great opportunity to show him how much you care.", "1592": "That's understandable. It can be hard to see someone younger than you getting something nice. Have you talked to your brother about it?", "1593": "That's awesome! It must feel great to have some more freedom.", "1594": "No, I do not have any younger siblings. But I'm sure you're relieved to have one less responsibility.", "1595": "That sounds really nice. How long had it been since you last saw them?", "1596": "It sounds like it was a good experience. What did you two talk about?", "1597": "That must be really hard. Is there anything in particular that you miss the most?", "1598": "Yes, I do get back fairly often, and I totally agree. Even when I do visit, things don't feel quite the same. It's like I'm a visitor instead of a local.", "1599": "Oh wow. That must have been a strange experience for you. How did you feel about it?", "1600": "That's very admirable of you. It must have been a difficult situation.", "1601": "That's great! How did it go?", "1602": "That's great! It's always nice to show your friends support. Was the play any good?", "1603": "That sounds really tough. Is there anything that helps you when you feel this way?", "1604": "No problem! I'm glad I could help.", "1605": "That's awesome! What did you like about the recipe? Did it turn out the way you expected it to?", "1606": "That's awesome! It's so great when you find something that turns out well and you know you can do it again.", "1607": "That's great news! It sounds like you've been putting in a lot of effort and dedication to your work. Have you spoken to your supervisor about the possibility of a promotion?", "1608": "That is true. Keeping up with the latest developments and having a potential for a raise is a great motivator. It is great that you are taking the initiative to stay ahead.", "1609": "That's so wonderful! How far along are you?", "1610": "That's great! I'm sure with your husband by your side, you'll make it through just fine. Just remember to take care of yourself too. It's easy to forget that when you're so focused on the baby. Good luck!", "1611": "That sounds really scary! What kind of videos were you watching?", "1612": "Yes, I can relate. I have done the same thing and felt the same way. It can be a bit unnerving to be alone in the dark and watch something that's meant to be scary.", "1613": "That sounds exciting! Where do you plan to watch the games?", "1614": "That's awesome! What do you like about them?", "1615": "Wow, that sounds incredible! Did you give it a try yourself?", "1616": "That must have been an amazing experience! It's awesome that you got to witness something like that in person.", "1617": "That's really nice of you! Where are you thinking of taking him?", "1618": "That's great! Taking your friend out to dinner is a really nice way to say thank you. Where are you thinking of going?", "1619": "That must have been a lot of work. How did it go?", "1620": "That's great! Congratulations on all your hard work paying off.", "1621": "I'm so sorry to hear that. How are you feeling?", "1622": "It must be so hard for them. Is there anything I can do to help?", "1623": "Wow, that must have been a huge surprise. How are you feeling about it now?", "1624": "That is understandable. Have you been able to talk to anyone about it yet?", "1625": "That must have been really stressful for you. What did you do to prepare for the flooding?", "1626": "That was a very wise decision. Did you have to evacuate your home?", "1627": "That must have been a really difficult experience for you. How did you feel afterwards?", "1628": "That is true, but it sounds like you regret your decision and have learned a valuable lesson. Have you been able to forgive yourself for it?", "1629": "That's really kind of you! What have you been doing to help them out?", "1630": "That's understandable. It's tough to be sick and have to rely on someone else for help. I'm sure he appreciates all you're doing for him.", "1631": "That's great! It's so nice to see that your hard work paid off. Congratulations!", "1632": "That's great! It's always rewarding to see the results of hard work. Congratulations!", "1633": "That sounds like it must have been a pretty disappointing way to end things. What was the movie about?", "1634": "That sounds like a great way to make a bad situation better. I'm glad you had a good time with your friends before you moved.", "1635": "That sounds like it was really nerve-wracking. Did you feel like you did well in the interview?", "1636": "That's great to hear! Congratulations on getting the job!", "1637": "That sounds really frustrating. What did you do?", "1638": "That's really inconsiderate of her. Did you say something to her about it?", "1639": "Oh no! That must have been so embarrassing. Are you okay? Did you get hurt?", "1640": "I can imagine. That must have been so embarrassing. Is there anything I can do to help you feel better?", "1641": "That's great! It must have been so rewarding for you to see him finally pick up on it. How did you go about teaching him?", "1642": "That's so wonderful! It must be such a great feeling to see him learn something new.", "1643": "Wow, that sounds like a lot of fun! What did you do?", "1644": "That sounds like a really fun day. It's nice to have a date that you can just enjoy and not have to worry about when it's time to go home.  Did you guys have a good time?", "1645": "I'm so sorry to hear that. It sounds like it was a difficult experience for you. Is there anything I can do to help you with the grief you're feeling?", "1646": "I'm so sorry. That must have been really hard to go through. Did you have time to say goodbye?", "1647": "That must have been really tough! What was it like?", "1648": "Yeah, I do. That was so exciting. It was like a little reward for all your hard work. It was a nice feeling!", "1649": "That must be quite a strange experience. Do you like it?", "1650": "I can understand your frustration. Is there anything you can do to make the ride more enjoyable?", "1651": "I'm so sorry to hear that. It sounds like it must have been a difficult decision. Is there anything I can do to help you through this?", "1652": "That's great to hear. It sounds like it was a tough decision, but I'm glad to hear that you're doing better. Is there anything I can do to help?", "1653": "Oh no! How did that happen?", "1654": "Haha, sounds like it! What did you do when you realized your mistake?", "1655": "That must be a bittersweet feeling. It's hard to believe how quickly our children grow up! How are you feeling about sending him off to college?", "1656": "It's so true. Kids grow up so quickly and it's hard to believe how fast it goes. I'm sure you're feeling a mix of emotions, from pride to nostalgia.", "1657": "Oh no! That must have been really embarrassing. I'm so sorry that happened to you. How are you feeling now?", "1658": "That sounds like it was really hard to go through. It's good that you were able to laugh it off though. I'm glad you're okay!", "1659": "Oh no! That's not a good thing to do. Is there anything I can do to help you?", "1660": "That was a nice gesture. Did it make you feel any better?", "1661": "I'm so sorry for your loss. It sounds like it's been a really difficult journey for you. Is there anything I can do to help you cope with the grief?", "1662": "That must have been incredibly difficult for you and your family. It's understandable that you wouldn't want to burden them with your pain. It's important to remember that it's ok to lean on your parents for support in times like this, even if you feel like you have to be strong for them. Have you found any ways to cope with the grief that have helped you?", "1663": "That's true! It's not easy to find a job these days, so it's definitely something to be grateful for. Is there something in particular that you're thankful for in regards to your job?", "1664": "That's a wonderful way to show your appreciation. What kind of job are you hoping to have?", "1665": "I understand. It's great that you're feeling grateful for the job you have.

How did they pull it off?", "1670": "Wow, 34! That's a big milestone. How did it feel to have your family throw you a surprise party?", "1671": "That must be really hard for you. Is there any way you can stay in contact with them?", "1672": "That's wonderful! I'm sure they can't wait to meet him. What are you most looking forward to about the visit?", "1673": "That must have been really frustrating. Is there anything I can do to help?", "1674": "That sounds like a fun show! How did you like it?", "1675": "That must be so satisfying! It's great when things turn out just the way you planned.", "1676": "That's great! It sounds like you have a good handle on the situation.", "1677": "That sounds great! Where are you going? Is there anything I can do to help make your travel easier?", "1678": "It's understandable to feel nervous when you have to fly for a long period of time. Have you tried any techniques to help calm your nerves?", "1679": "That must have been hard for you to realize. What do you think you can do to make it up to her?", "1680": "That must have been hard for her. Do you think you can make it up to her somehow?", "1681": "That sounds like a great day! It's nice to have some free time to relax and enjoy yourself. Did you do anything special?", "1682": "Yeah, I know the feeling. I have a lot of trees in my yard, so it's a constant battle to keep them trimmed and the leaves raked. It's a lot of work, but it's so satisfying when it's all done.", "1683": "yeah, it's been a bit of a battle. But I'm determined to win!", "1684": "That must be really hard for you. Is there anything I can do to help you out while he's away?", "1685": "That must be difficult for both of you. Do you have any strategies to make it easier?", "1686": "That must have been really difficult for you. Do you feel like you were able to communicate your feelings to him at the time?", "1687": "That sounds like it could have been a difficult situation. It's understandable that it would make you feel uncomfortable. Have you talked to him about it since then? That could help you both understand each other's perspectives and feelings better.", "1688": "That's great! What kind of things is she doing?", "1689": "That's amazing! What kind of art does she do?", "1690": "Oh no, that sounds awful. How did you handle the situation? ", "1691": "That was a good way to handle it. It's important to stand up for your daughter and make sure she knows she's being protected. Did the father take any action?", "1692": "I'm sorry to hear that. What's making you unhappy about it?", "1693": "That sounds really difficult. Is there anything you can do to make it better for him?", "1694": "That sounds like a great tradition! What do you usually do with the bonus money?", "1695": "That makes sense. It's always a good idea to save for a rainy day. What do you think you'll do if you don't get the bonus this year?", "1696": "That sounds really unpleasant. Is there something else you'd rather watch?", "1697": "That sounds awful! I'm so glad you didn't watch the whole thing. Is there something else you'd like to watch instead?", "1698": "I can imagine. That must be really hard. Is there anything you can do to make the waiting easier?", "1699": "I can imagine. That must be very stressful. What kind of work does your husband do?", "1700": "I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like it can be tough when your partner is away so often. Is there anything I can do to help make things a bit easier for you?", "1701": "I understand. It can be difficult to be alone after so many years of being married. Have you considered finding ways to stay connected with your husband while he is away? Maybe video calls or sending each other letters? That might help you feel less alone.", "1702": "That must have been a really special moment for you. It's amazing how quickly they grow up. It's a reminder to make the most of the time we have with them.", "1703": "It is amazing how quickly they can change and grow. It's like they're a different person every few years.", "1704": "Oh no, that must have been really scary! What did you do after you heard it?", "1705": "I'm glad you were able to get away safely. That must have been a frightening experience. Is there anything I can do to help?", "1706": "I'm so sorry to hear that. It must be really difficult for you to think about him. Is there anything I can do to help you through this?", "1707": "I'm so sorry to hear that. It must have been a difficult time for you and your family. Is there anything I can do to help you feel better?", "1708": "That's great to hear! It must have taken a lot of hard work and dedication to get the job. How does it feel to have achieved something so significant?", "1709": "Oh no, that must have been really upsetting for you. How are you feeling now?", "1710": "I understand. It's a difficult situation and you need to decide what's best for you. Have you talked to anyone else about it?", "1711": "Oh, that sounds like a great time! How was it?", "1712": "That sounds really nice. What kind of memories did you have?", "1713": "That must have been really upsetting. What happened?", "1714": "That's really unfair. It's not right for someone to try and take credit for your hard work. Have you talked to your boss about it?", "1715": "Wow, that must have been amazing! How was it?", "1716": "That's amazing! He should definitely be recognized for the effort he put into it. It must have been an incredible experience.", "1717": "Oh no, that must have been really embarrassing. Is there anything I can do to help you feel better?", "1718": "That must have been so embarrassing for you. Is there anything I can do to help?", "1719": "That's a big step! How do you feel about it?", "1720": "That's understandable. Have you and your girlfriend talked about the meeting at all? What kind of things has she said?", "1721": "That must have been really hard for you. How are you feeling now?", "1722": "I can understand why you would feel so let down. It's totally understandable. Have you talked to her about it since then?", "1723": "I'm so sorry to hear that. That must have been really difficult for you. Is there anything I can do to help you feel better?", "1724": "That must have been so difficult for you. What a relief that everyone is healthy and doing well. That's what matters most!", "1725": "Wow, that must have been so exciting! How did you react?", "1726": "That's so romantic! What did you do afterwards?", "1727": "That's great! It sounds like you really appreciate his approach to leadership. What qualities do you think make him a good boss?", "1728": "That is great to have a boss that is a good leader and is respectful of his employees.", "1729": "That sounds like such a peaceful and magical experience. What did you like most about it?", "1730": "That must have been so beautiful to watch!", "1731": "That sounds really frustrating. Is there anything you can do to help yourself get a better night's sleep? Maybe try a different bedtime routine or a different sleeping environment?", "1732": "That sounds really frustrating. Have you tried any strategies to help you sleep better?", "1733": "Congratulations! That's so exciting! How does it feel to finally be on the brink of owning your own home?", "1734": "Wow, that's so cool! How does it feel to be buying your first house?", "1735": "Oh no, did something come up and you weren't able to make it?", "1736": "Oh no, that's so unfortunate. Is there anything I can do to help?", "1737": "I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed. Is there anything I can do to help?", "1738": "That must be really hard for you. Have you tried explaining to her why you can't always play?", "1739": "That sounds so sweet! What did the drawing look like?", "1740": "Wow, she's got talent!  That's amazing!  Kids really amaze us with what they can do!  It must have been so special to see that.", "1741": "Did they finish the assignments?", "1742": "That must have been frustrating. Did you manage to get it all done?", "1743": "That's great news! What kind of job is it?", "1744": "That's great to hear! It sounds like you're feeling more confident about the process. What kind of job are you hoping to get?", "1745": "That's so exciting! What kind of photos were they?", "1746": "That sounds so nice! What did you do with them?", "1747": "I'm so sorry to hear that.

What kind of job are you interviewing for? ", "1750": "That's great that you took the extra time to make sure you're ready. I'm sure it will pay off. Good luck!", "1751": "Oh no, what happened?", "1752": "That sounds really disappointing. Did you get to enjoy the piece you had at least?", "1753": "I'm so sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to help?", "1754": "That must have been a difficult experience for you. Is there anything I can do to help?", "1755": "I'm sorry to hear that. How did you feel when they missed it?", "1756": "Absolutely not. Birthdays are special and should be celebrated. It's a reminder that we are loved and appreciated.", "1757": "That's great news! Congratulations! What kind of job is it?", "1758": "That sounds like a great opportunity. What made you decide to apply for the job? ", "1759": "Oh no! What happened?", "1760": "Oh no! That must have been so scary. Did you manage to get out of there okay?", "1761": "That must have been really scary for you. How did you eventually overcome your fear of driving?", "1762": "That's great that you were able to overcome your fear! It's admirable that you were able to push through it.", "1763": "That sounds like it was a hassle. How did you manage to do it?  Was it difficult? ", "1764": "That's great that you were able to do it yourself!  It's always so empowering to figure out how to do something like that.  How did it turn out?", "1765": "That must have been really frustrating. What did you do?", "1766": "I can imagine. It must have been really frustrating to have someone take credit for your hard work. Did you talk to your professor about it?", "1767": "That's wonderful. What do you appreciate most about her?", "1768": "That's so sweet! How long have you been married?", "1769": "That sounds really frustrating. Did you talk to the professor about it?", "1770": "That's understandable.

What are you looking forward to the most about your move to Alaska?", "2078": "That must be really frustrating.

Let me know if you need any help shopping! ", "2098": "That is so sweet of them. It is really nice to have family who can help out. It must be a relief to know that you have that support.", "2099": "Wow, that's really unfair! How did you feel when you found out?", "2100": "That's good. I'm glad you were able to get some justice.

Is there anything you can do to make the waiting easier? Maybe you could bring something to do while you wait, like a book or a game?", "2103": "That sounds really hard. I'm sorry to hear that. How are you feeling about it?", "2104": "That's understandable. It's hard to say goodbye to someone you care about. Have you considered setting up video calls so you can still see each other's faces?

You must be excited to watch your favorite shows in a bigger size! ", "2113": "I'm so sorry to hear that. How can I help? ", "2114": "That's really kind of you. What kind of things do you do together?", "2115": "I completely agree. We need to start working together to find solutions to our problems. We can all contribute to finding a way forward that works for everyone.", "2116": "Compromising and finding common ground is the only way to make progress. We need to work together to come up with solutions that everyone can agree on.", "2117": "That sounds really hard. How did you feel about that experience?", "2118": "That sounds really tough.

Did you enjoy it?", "2138": "Yeah, that can be really frustrating. It's like they're not even paying attention. Have you ever had a situation like that?", "2139": "It's so dangerous and selfish. It's really frustrating when people don't pay attention to the other drivers on the road. Have you ever had an experience like this before? ", "2140": "That sounds really scary. Have you tried any techniques to help you manage your fear of the dark?", "2141": "That makes sense. It's ok to do whatever makes you feel safe and comfortable. Is there anything else that helps you feel better when you are scared of the dark?", "2142": "That sounds like a really rewarding experience! It's great that you're willing to give up your time to help out the animals. Do you have a favorite dog that you like to walk?", "2143": "That sounds like a great experience for both you and the dogs. How often do you go?", "2144": "Oh no! That must have been so inconvenient. Was the power out for very long?", "2145": "That sounds really scary! Did the power come back on soon after?", "2146": "Oh no, that must have been really upsetting. How did your mother react?", "2147": "That's understandable. It must have been a difficult situation. Is there anything I can do to help?", "2148": "Oh no! That sounds awful. Did you manage to get it all down?", "2149": "That's understandable. I'm sure you'll feel better soon. Maybe try something light like toast or a smoothie later on. It's important to keep your energy up.", "2150": "That sounds really peaceful! I love the sound of rain. It's so soothing. What made you so happy? ", "2151": "It really is a soothing sound. It's like the rain is singing you a lullaby. Have you experienced any other calming moments like that recently?", "2152": "Oh no, that must have been really scary. Have you been able to get back behind the wheel since then?", "2153": "That sounds really tough. Is there any way you can get help with the cost of therapy?

It can be hard to get the hang of putting spin on a bowling ball. Did you have someone coaching you or were you just trying it out on your own?", "2214": "That's a relief! Bowling can be really fun, but it can also be really frustrating. Have you ever tried to get some tips from someone who's better at it?", "2215": "I'm so sorry that happened to you.

How did you manage to make the most of it?", "2244": "That sounds like an amazing adventure! I'm glad you had a great time despite not having your friends with you.", "2245": "I can understand how you might feel jealous or left out. It's natural to feel that way when something you wanted goes to someone else. Is there anything I can do to help you process your feelings?", "2246": "I can understand that. It must be hard to see something you want so much go to someone else. Have you talked to your brother about it?", "2247": "That's understandable. What makes you nervous about it?", "2248": "I understand. It can be really hard to make a big purchase like this. What are you most nervous about?", "2249": "Wow, that's really crazy.

Are you planning on staying in Texas then?", "2271": "That's really annoying, isn't it? What do you do when you're faced with that situation?", "2272": "I use an outhouse.

It's important to remember that everyone has their own struggles and we can't always tell what they are just by looking at them.", "2393": "That was really kind of you.

What matters most is that you are taking care of yourself and making sure you are healthy.", "2446": "Oh no, that's terrible! Is there anything that you can do to try and get the card and gift card back? Have you reported it to the post office?", "2447": "That's really unfortunate.

I'm glad you were able to handle it with integrity.", "2479": "I can understand that. It can be very intimidating to be around heights.

Is there anything I can do to help make it easier for you?", "2597": "That must be really difficult for you. Is there anything you can do to make the situation better?", "2598": "I understand. It can be hard to see someone else getting something we want. Have you talked to him about it?", "2599": "Oh no, that must have been so unpleasant! What did you do?", "2600": "That's good to hear. It's always nice when companies are understanding and willing to make it right. I'm glad you got your money back.", "2601": "That must have been really difficult for you. What made you anxious?", "2602": "I can understand why that would make you feel anxious. Did you still have fun at the theme park despite feeling anxious?", "2603": "That sounds really upsetting. How did you handle the situation?", "2604": "I'm sorry to hear that. That must have been really hurtful. Is there anything I can do to help?", "2605": "I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're going through a difficult time. Is there anything I can do to help?", "2606": "That's understandable. Maybe you can start by doing something small like saying hi to people you pass in the hallways or joining a club that interests you. That way, you can take things at your own pace and get to know people without feeling overwhelmed.", "2607": "That sounds really tough. Have you talked to her about how you're feeling?", "2608": "It sounds like you have a lot of insecurity in your relationship. Have you talked to her about it?", "2609": "That sounds really frightening. What was it about the movie that scared you?", "2610": "That sounds difficult.

How was the water?", "2617": "That must feel really frustrating. Is there anything I can do to help?", "2618": "That is understandable. Maybe try writing down how you feel and practice saying it out loud. That way you can get more comfortable with expressing your feelings.", "2619": "That sounds so nice! It must be really special to have those moments with your family.", "2620": "That's wonderful! It must be nice to have that time to catch up with each other.", "2621": "That sounds like a really nice surprise! What made them decide to do that?", "2622": "That's so nice of them to do that for you. What did you do at the party?", "2623": "That's really unfortunate. It must be hard to see people treating each other that way. Is there anything you can do to help?", "2624": "It's a tough situation, but I think it's important to focus on the positive and do our part to spread kindness and compassion. We may not be able to change the world, but we can make a difference in our own corner of it.", "2625": "That must be really hard for you. Is there anything I can do to help?", "2626": "It can be hard to start a difficult conversation, but it's important to express your feelings. Maybe you could start by telling them that you feel left out and would like more attention.", "2627": "I'm so sorry to hear that. That must have been really frustrating. Is there anything I can do to help?", "2628": "That's understandable. Is there anything I can do to help?", "2629": "That sounds really annoying. It must be really frustrating to be woken up like that. Is there anything you can do to try and get her to be quieter? Have you talked to her about it?", "2630": "That's great that you are taking action. I hope they can help you out and get you into a better place. Good luck! ", "2631": "That sounds difficult. Can you tell me more about what you mean?", "2632": "I'm sorry to hear that. Can you think of any ways to protect yourself from being taken advantage of?", "2633": "That's great! How does it feel to be so close to achieving your goal?", "2634": "That's great to hear! What kind of career are you looking to pursue?", "2635": "I can understand why. It can be a very stressful experience. Is there anything I can do to help make it easier for you?", "2636": "I understand. It can be really uncomfortable. What helps you get through it?", "2637": "That's wonderful! It's great to see someone put in the hard work and get the rewards they deserve. It's an inspiration to us all.", "2638": "Thanks for the encouragement! I'm going to start looking for opportunities and see what I can find.", "2639": "Ha, that's a good one. I'm not sure I'm up for that kind of challenge though.", "2640": "Wow, that's amazing! It sounds like they had a great comeback.", "2641": "That's great! It's always nice to see a team turn it around like that.", "2642": "That's great news! What kind of car are you planning to get?", "2643": "Those are both great choices. Have you had a chance to look at any models yet? ", "2644": "Oh wow, that sounds really scary! Did you manage to get the bug out?", "2645": "That must have been so scary! Did he get rid of it?", "2646": "That's so kind of her! It's always nice to get a little taste of home, especially when it's a surprise. Did you get to try it?", "2647": "That sounds delicious! I'm sure you were very grateful for the thoughtful gesture.", "2648": "Cabot Creamery is from Vermont. It's been around for over 100 years and is still family owned and operated. I'm sure you'd love it.", "2649": "That sounds like a great place to live! There is a cheese factory in North Carolina called the Cabot Cheese Factory. They make a variety of cheeses, including cheddar.", "2650": "I'm so sorry to hear that. It must be really hard to have his birthday come around. Is there anything I can do to help you through this difficult time?", "2651": "That must have been hard for you when he moved away. How did he pass away?", "2652": "That's too bad. Is there something else you can do instead?", "2653": "That's a bummer. Do you guys have any ideas for what you can do inside instead?", "2654": "That sounds like it was a great time! How was it?", "2655": "That sounds like it was a much needed break. How was the visit?", "2656": "Sounds like you had a great time!", "2657": "That's great. I bet it was nice to relax and spend time with your family.", "2658": "It's definitely a difficult time. It's hard to see so much division and disagreement. What do you think can be done to help bring people together? ", "2659": "I agree. It's important for us to come together and find common ground so that we can move forward. We all have different perspectives, but we can still find a way to work together.", "2660": "I'm so sorry to hear that. It sounds like it was a shock for you and your family. How have you been dealing with the loss?", "2661": "I'm so sorry to hear that. That must have been incredibly hard for you and your family. How have you been managing your grief? Have you been able to find ways to cope?", "2662": "Why do you feel that way?", "2663": "I can understand why that might make you feel guilty. How did you come to the decision not to visit them?", "2664": "That sounds like a lot of fun! What kind of music will you be seeing?", "2665": "Yes, I\u2019ve heard of them both. They\u2019re great artists. Are you excited for the show?", "2666": "That sounds like a great situation to be in. It's nice to have someone who is reliable and follows through on their promises. It can be so frustrating when people don't keep their word. I'm glad that you have someone who is so efficient and organized.", "2667": "That's great to hear. It sounds like she's really on top of things.", "2668": "That must have been a bit of a shock after the summer break! How are they doing with the transition?", "2669": "That's great that you were prepared! It can be hard to get everything together in time. It sounds like it was a bit of a roller coaster of emotions.", "2670": "That sounds like a lot of fun! How was it?", "2671": "That sounds like so much fun! Was it everything you'd hoped for?", "2672": "That must have been a really special experience for them. How did they like it?", "2673": "Wow, that's a lot of money! Did you win?", "2674": "That's too bad, but at least someone got to win the big prize. It's still exciting to have a chance at something like that.", "2675": "That's wonderful news! How does it make you feel?", "2676": "That's wonderful. I'm sure you and your husband are thrilled. What do you plan on doing with the bonus?", "2677": "That sounds like it must have been a really special day for you. How was it?", "2678": "That's so wonderful! How does it feel to see him finally get to live in his own place?", "2679": "That sounds really tough. Is there any type of food that everyone would agree on?  Maybe the decision could be narrowed down to just a few places that way.", "2680": "That can be tough.  Is there any food that everyone likes?  Maybe you can start with that and narrow down the choices. ", "2681": "Yes, that's a good idea.  And it would be quick and easy to make.  Then you can use the wheel for next week.  That way everyone can have a say.", "2682": "Me too! What are you looking forward to doing this weekend?", "2683": "I have a regular 9-5 job, so I'm always happy when it's Friday! What are your plans for the weekend?", "2684": "I'm sorry to hear that. Do you know what's causing the fights?", "2685": "It sounds like you care about your friend a lot. Have you tried talking to him about why he's fighting with you? Maybe you can work through it together.", "2686": "I'm so sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're looking for a way to manage your condition. Have you talked to your doctor about the diet you found?", "2687": "I understand. What kind of diet is it? Is it something that you can stick to? ", "2688": "I'm so sorry to hear that. It must have been a terrifying experience. It's understandable that you would be so scared. Is there anything I can do to help you feel better?", "2689": "Yes, they can be very destructive. How have you been coping since then?", "2690": "That's so sweet! How did the shopping experience go? Was it something you both enjoyed?", "2691": "That's so sweet of him! It must have been a nice surprise. Did you find a style you like?", "2692": "That sounds like so much fun! I love driving around to see all the decorations too. It's a great way to get into the holiday spirit.", "2693": "That sounds really special.

Did you at least get to do some other fun activities while you were there?", "2698": "That's great news! Congratulations to your husband! How does he feel about it?", "2699": "That's great! I'm sure he's feeling really excited and accomplished right now. Congratulations!", "2700": "That was very trusting of you. How did it go? Did everything turn out okay?", "2701": "That's understandable. It's a big responsibility to entrust someone with your house and pets. Did everything turn out okay?", "2702": "I'm so sorry to hear that. That must have been really hard for you. Is there anything I can do to help?", "2703": "I can understand why that would be difficult. Is there anything I can do to help you feel better?", "2704": "Oh no, that sounds really scary! What did you do?", "2705": "That's a relief. What did you do?", "2706": "That sounds like a wonderful way to spend some quality time together.

It's understandable why you didn't tell her, but it's understandable that it still bothers you. Is there anything you can do to make yourself feel better?", "2711": "I see. It sounds like you were trying to do what was best for your friend. Have you thought about talking to a professional or a trusted friend about it? It sounds like you could use some support.", "2712": "That sounds like a great idea! What diet are you trying? How long have you been on it? Have you noticed any changes?", "2713": "I understand. That's a lot of pressure to put on yourself. Is there anything I can do to help you feel more comfortable?  Maybe I can help you research different diet options or provide moral support.", "2714": "That sounds really stressful. Is there anything you can do to try and help her understand the instructions better?", "2715": "Yeah, it can be really frustrating. Have you talked to your supervisor about it? Maybe they can help address the issue.", "2716": "I'm so sorry to hear that. It must have been a really difficult experience for you and your daughter. Is there anything I can do to help you guys out?", "2717": "I'm so sorry to hear that. It must have been heartbreaking for you to see your daughter in such pain.

It's always nice to have a bit of extra money to help out with bills.", "2721": "Oh no, what happened?", "2722": "That's terrible! Did they stop to apologize or offer to pay for the damages?", "2723": "I can understand why that would make you angry. It sounds like your husband was trying to be a good friend, but it was a bit too much. It's understandable to feel frustrated in that situation. Is there anything that you wish you had done differently?", "2724": "I can imagine. It's understandable that you felt a bit angry in the moment. It's good that you two were able to talk about it and understand each other's perspectives.", "2725": "What happened?", "2726": "Oh no! That sounds really frustrating.

Have you been using any particular study methods that have been helping you?", "2733": "That sounds like it was a lot of fun! Did you have a favorite team that you were rooting for?", "2734": "That's awesome that you got to go. How was the atmosphere?", "2735": "That must have been so frustrating! Did you get a good look at it?", "2736": "That's understandable. Have you contacted the local animal shelters or police to see if anyone has reported a missing dog?", "2737": "I'm so sorry to hear that. How are you doing? Is there anything I can do to help?", "2738": "I can imagine how difficult this must be for you. Is there anything I can do to help you?", "2739": "That must be really hard for you. Is there anything I can do to help you feel less lonely?", "2740": "That's understandable! Maybe you can find some kind of white noise machine to help drown out any weird sounds? That might help you relax a bit.", "2741": "That's wonderful! Congratulations! How does he feel about it?", "2742": "That's amazing! Congratulations! I'm sure you'll be able to figure out the best way to use the extra money. Have you thought about putting it towards a house or something like that?", "2743": "That's amazing! It sounds like she worked really hard. Are you proud of her?", "2744": "That's okay. We all have days like that. Have you tried drinking more water or eating something healthier to help balance out the sugar?", "2745": "That can be tough. Is there anything I can do to help you stay on track?", "2746": "That sounds really scary. Did you call the police?", "2747": "That's a good idea.

What's his name?", "2760": "Oh no! That's really annoying. Did you get any sleep after that?", "2761": "That's really frustrating. Did you find out who it was?", "2762": "Congratulations! How do you feel about the news?", "2763": "That's amazing! I'm sure you and your family are excited. Are you feeling okay?", "2764": "That sounds like so much fun!

How did your daughter react to meeting her?", "2772": "Wow, that must have been intense! How did you feel after watching it?", "2773": "That's understandable. I'm so sorry you had to sit through that. Did your husband like it?", "2774": "That must have been so much fun! What made you decide to do that?", "2775": "That sounds like a really nice trip down memory lane. Did it make you feel nostalgic?", "2776": "That's too bad. But it's nice that you still have some of those old friendships.", "2777": "Great! Let me know how it goes.  Good luck!", "2778": "What happened?", "2779": "That's really embarrassing! I'm glad he was a nice guy and was just trying to help you out.", "2780": "That's great! How does she feel about it?", "2781": "That's awesome!

How did you respond?", "2797": "I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like she was out of line. How did she respond?", "2798": "That was so kind of you and your husband. It must have made your cousin so happy to have her son's Christmas taken care of.", "2799": "It sounds like you and your husband have a lot of love to give.", "2800": "Oh, no! That sounds awful. Did you get hurt?", "2801": "That sounds really embarrassing. I'm sorry that happened to you.", "2802": "That's wonderful! It sounds like you and your husband have a strong financial plan in place.

Is there anything I can do to help you feel better?", "2808": "That must be really hard for you! It's natural to feel a bit apprehensive when your children grow up and start new things. It's a sign of how much you care about them and want the best for them. Have you talked to them about your feelings?", "2809": "I totally understand. It can be hard to think about them growing up and leaving the nest. But it also means they are growing into responsible adults and that's something to be proud of. Have you talked to them about how you're feeling?", "2810": "That's really impressive! You must have worked really hard to achieve such a great result.", "2811": "That's understandable.

It's hard to go against your parents' wishes, especially when you're young. But it sounds like you regret it now.", "2816": "That's great!

I'm always impressed by their creativity and skill.", "2836": "That's really sad. It was such an iconic store. It's a shame that it had to close its doors.", "2837": "Yeah it really does. It's hard to believe it's gone now. It was such a big part of our childhoods.", "2838": "That must be really hard for you.

It's so important to have a strong foundation of trust in a relationship. Have you two been together for a long time?", "2841": "It's understandable to feel that way. Cheating is a difficult thing to process and it can be hard to understand why someone would do it. It's good that you are so committed to your husband.", "2842": "Yes, I know that feeling. It can be hard to stay connected when everyone is always on their phones or iPads. Have you tried setting some boundaries or rules around electronics use?", "2843": "That sounds really isolating.

Have you tried talking to someone about it?", "2996": "I understand that feeling. It's hard to catch yourself in the act, but it's important to remember that we all make mistakes. It's part of being human. Maybe try to focus on being more understanding and compassionate when you catch yourself judging someone.", "2997": "That's great to hear! It sounds like you're really prepared and motivated. What are you most looking forward to? ", "2998": "That's great that you're already prepared and have a plan.

That sounds really scary. Did she leave any contact information?", "3132": "That's really scary. Did you call the police?", "3133": "Oh no! That's so gross. Did you tell the restaurant staff?", "3134": "That's great that they gave you a refund. I'm sorry that you had to go through that experience.

What made you so scared?", "3202": "That's great! How are you feeling about it?", "3203": "It's totally normal to feel a bit of pressure. Have you thought about how you want to make a good impression?", "3204": "That sounds really nerve-wracking! Is there anything I can do to help?", "3205": "That's understandable. It's natural to feel some nerves before an important presentation. What can I do to help you feel more confident?", "3206": "That's really tough. Is there any way you can get the cat to sleep in a different room?", "3207": "That is strange. Have you tried talking to your boyfriend about it?

Is there something that helps you cope with that feeling?", "3213": "That must have been tough. Did you have any good moments during the trip? ", "3214": "Oh wow, that must be really difficult for you. What are you feeling right now?", "3215": "I'm sorry to hear that. Have you talked to her about it? Maybe you could have an honest conversation and work out a plan that's mutually beneficial.", "3216": "Wow! How did you like it?", "3217": "That sounds really scary! Did you like it or did it just leave you feeling scared?", "3218": "Oh no! That sounds really scary. Are you okay now?", "3219": "I'm glad you were able to pull over and get it sorted out. That must have been really scary.", "3220": "That must have been a nice surprise! Did you think about keeping the extra money?", "3221": "That must have been a very uncomfortable situation for you.

It's nice to have those memories to look back on.", "3256": "That's great! What kind of puppy is he?", "3257": "That's understandable. German shepherds are such loyal and intelligent dogs, so it's worth the effort. Have you had any experience with dogs before?", "3258": "Oh no! That must have been so embarrassing! What did you do? ", "3259": "I'm so sorry that happened to you. Have you considered getting a new toupee?", "3260": "Oh no! That must have been really unpleasant.

How exciting that she'll be back soon!", "3324": "That's really nice of him! It sounds like you two have a good relationship.", "3325": "That's really nice of him to take the time to say goodbye. It's always sad to say goodbye to a place you've been living in for a while. Moving can be a stressful and exciting experience. Have you started packing yet?", "3326": "That's really unfair. Is there anything you can do about it?", "3327": "That's definitely not right. Is there anything you can do to get compensated for the extra hours you worked?", "3328": "Oh no, that's terrible! How are you feeling about it?", "3329": "That's too bad. It's really frustrating when people do stuff like that and there's no way to hold them accountable.

Have you been able to give your brother any advice on how to handle the waiting period?", "3336": "Wow, that sounds like an amazing opportunity! Where have they gone so far?", "3337": "That sounds like an amazing adventure. Have you been able to keep in touch with them while they're traveling?", "3338": "I'm sorry to hear that.

Have you tried any methods to get rid of them?", "3354": "Yeah, it's really frustrating. Have you tried any mosquito repellents or sprays to help keep them away?", "3355": "That must have been really hard for you. How did you manage to do it?", "3356": "Yes, I understand why you would be scared. It can be really intimidating to face something that you fear. But you did it, and you survived! That's something to be proud of.", "3357": "Wow, that sounds like an exciting experience! How do you feel about it?", "3358": "That's awesome! It sounds like you're really excited. Have you done anything like this before?", "3359": "Oh no, that must have been so frustrating. Did you manage to clean it up?", "3360": "Yikes! That sounds really unpleasant. I hope nothing like that happens again. Have you thought of a way to make sure you don't forget your glass outside again?", "3361": "That sounds like a difficult decision. What has been going through your mind since then?", "3362": "I can understand why you're feeling nervous. Have you talked to your doctor about your concerns?", "3363": "That's great that your friend was able to help you out! It can be really stressful to prepare for a trip. Did they have any advice or tips to make the process easier?", "3364": "That's really great to have a friend like that. It must be really reassuring to know that you have someone to rely on.", "3365": "Yes, I totally agree. It can be really hard to manage our expectations and boundaries when it comes to using our phones. How have you been handling it? ", "3366": "That must have been really embarrassing.

Is there anything I can do to help?", "3368": "That must be so hard for her. Is there anything I can do to help you and your family through this tough time?", "3369": "That sounds really hard. Is there anything I can do to help you feel better?", "3370": "That sounds like a great way to spend a week! I'm sure you miss her, but it's nice to have a little break from the daily routine. Have you been able to keep in touch with her while she's away?", "3371": "That sounds great! Moving can be a lot of work, but it's a fresh start in a new place. What are you most looking forward to in your new place? ", "3372": "Mine are pretty loud too. They like to play loud music late at night and they have a lot of people over. It can get pretty noisy.", "3373": "That's great news! How have you been doing while she's been away?", "3374": "That sounds rough.

It must have been so nice to have some peace and quiet. What did you do with all that extra time?", "3384": "That must be really annoying. What did you do with all the extra freedom?", "3385": "That must have been a bit of a letdown. How did you handle it?", "3386": "That's a great idea! Moving can be a great way to start fresh and I'm sure you'll find some great neighbors to have.", "3387": "Oh no! That must have been embarrassing. How did you handle it? ", "3388": "That's a relief! I'm glad you noticed before it was too late. It's always a good idea to do a quick check in the mirror before leaving the house.", "3389": "That must have been a strange experience!

It must be so rewarding to see him living out his calling.", "3401": "Oh no! That sounds like a mess. Did you manage to clean it up?", "3402": "That sounds really frustrating.

How did you manage to calm yourself down?", "3425": "It sounds like you have put in a lot of preparation for this interview. Have you taken any steps to help you feel more confident?", "3426": "That sounds like a great opportunity. Have you done any mock interviews to practice? That can help you feel more confident and comfortable with your answers. It also gives you a chance to practice your body language and ensure you look and sound confident. ", "3427": "That sounds really nice! It's always nice to reminisce and remember the good times. What was the dream about?", "3428": "That sounds really nice. Do you think you'll reach out to her soon?", "3429": "That's great! It's always nice to reconnect with old friends.", "3430": "Wow, that's amazing! What kind of puppy is it?", "3431": "That's so nice! What kind of puppy is it?", "3432": "That's so frustrating! Did you end up buying it?", "3433": "That's too bad. Have you tried looking online for a similar dress at a more reasonable price?", "3434": "That sounds like it was really hard to resist. Is there something else you can do to help you control your cravings next time?", "3435": "It's okay, we all make mistakes. You don't have to beat yourself up over it.

Have you been following the teams and players closely?", "3441": "That makes sense. It's great that you have a passion for it. Is there anything in particular that you love about watching the Ryder Cup?", "3442": "Oh no, that must have been so hard for her. It's never easy to hear someone put down someone you love. What did you do?", "3443": "That's understandable. It's natural to want to protect your daughter. Did you talk to anyone about it?", "3444": "Wow, that must have been really strange and unexpected. How are you feeling about it?", "3445": "That's terrible! Is there anything that you can do to stop your cat from doing this?", "3446": "That's terrible. It's heartbreaking to hear about animals being mistreated. Is there anything we can do to help?", "3447": "I agree. It's heartbreaking to think about how some people can be so cruel. We need to do more to protect animals from these kinds of people.", "3448": "That sounds really scary. What did the noise sound like?", "3449": "I can totally understand why you were so scared. It's always better to be safe than sorry. Did you call the police?", "3450": "That's really great of you to trust him. Have you talked to him about when he might be able to pay you back?", "3451": "That's great! It's always nice to help out a friend in need. I'm sure he'll be sure to repay you as soon as he can.", "3452": "Wow, that sounds really exciting! What happened then?", "3453": "That sounds so romantic! What a great surprise!", "3454": "That sounds really creepy! What kind of drone are you talking about? ", "3455": "That sounds really unsettling. What do you think it could be used for?", "3456": "That sounds really frustrating. Is there a way you can talk to her about it?", "3457": "That sounds really annoying. Do you think she knows she's being nosy?", "3458": "I'm so sorry to hear that. It must be hard to lose a pet who was such a big part of your life. Is there anything I can do to help you through this difficult time?", "3459": "I'm so sorry to hear that. It must have been difficult to go through that process.

It's always better to be prepared for any situation. Did you make sure to include things like a blanket, first aid kit, and jumper cables?", "3465": "Wow, that's quite a story!

It sounds like she has made incredible progress. How did you manage to help her so much?", "3478": "That sounds really unpleasant. Did you manage to find something to do indoors?", "3479": "That sounds like a really nice plan. Maybe you could try again tomorrow if the weather is better?  I'm sure you could use some vitamin D.", "3480": "Wow, that sounds like it was quite an experience! How did you like it?", "3481": "That must have been quite a scare! Was anyone hurt?", "3482": "That sounds like a wise decision. What have you found so far? Have you been able to compare the different quotes and decide which one is best for you?", "3483": "Yes, it can be quite expensive. Have you looked into any discounts or special offers that might make it more affordable?", "3484": "Oh no, that sounds really uncomfortable. Is there anything I can do to help?", "3485": "I understand. Have you tried substituting healthier snacks for the sweets? That might help you stay on track.", "3486": "Oh no, that must have been really scary. Can you tell me what happened?", "3487": "That must be really disorienting. Have you seen a doctor or therapist about it?", "3488": "It's okay. Accidents happen. Let's figure out how to get the dog back safely. Do you know where it might have gone? ", "3489": "That must be really hard. Is there anything I can do to help you look for him?", "3490": "That sounds really tough. It must have been really confusing and hurtful. Is there anything I can do to help?", "3491": "That sounds really tough. It's understandable that you would feel discarded after that. It's not fair that she just ghosted you like that. Have you been able to process that experience and move on?", "3492": "That's really sweet of them! It's so nice to see people being so generous and kind. It sounds like you were really touched by their gesture.", "3493": "That's so true. It always feels good to help others, and it's a great reminder that we're all in this together.", "3494": "That's great news! How is he feeling about it?", "3495": "That's great! It takes a lot of courage and dedication to pursue a degree while still in active duty. I'm sure he'll do great!", "3496": "That sounds really difficult. What happened to make it so that you can't enjoy the restaurant anymore?", "3497": "That's really gross and unacceptable. I'm sorry that happened to you.

It's always nice to treat yourself to something special.", "3506": "That must have been such a relief! How did you decide to spend the bonus?", "3507": "That's great that you are taking the initiative to start saving for your retirement. It's never too early to start planning for the future.", "3508": "That's so exciting! I'm sure it will go great. What age group are you teaching?", "3509": "That sounds like a great opportunity! Teaching all the subjects for 3rd grade is a great way to get to know the students. I'm sure you'll do great! Have you done any teaching before?", "3510": "I'm so sorry to hear that.

How are you feeling about it?", "3519": "I understand. It's natural to feel nervous, but I'm sure he will do great and you have done an amazing job preparing him for this. Have you talked to him about it?", "3520": "absolutely! it's a natural part of growing up and letting go. you should be proud of him for taking this big step.", "3521": "it is! enjoy this time and the moments that you can share with him.", "3522": "That sounds like such a special memory! It's great to have something to look back on that brings back such strong, positive emotions.", "3523": "It sounds like it was a really special moment for you.", "3524": "That sounds really stressful. What do you think is the best way to get your grade up? Have you talked to your professor about it?", "3525": "That's still a great grade! Have you tried going over the material again, or talking to the professor to see what you can do to raise your grade?", "3526": "That's so sweet of him! What did he make?", "3527": "That's great! It's important to set boundaries like that. What else do you two like to do together?", "3528": "Yeah, I totally understand. I always make a list before I go grocery shopping and I make sure to include coffee filters on it. It's so annoying to forget something important like that.", "3529": "That sounds awful. I'm sorry you had to go through that. Is there anything I can do to help make sure it doesn't happen again?", "3530": "That sounds like a lot. Can you tell me more about what you're going through?", "3531": "Ah, so you're interested in getting a bearded dragon for your child? What about them drew you to them as a pet?", "3532": "That's great to hear! It sounds like you've been able to find a lot of success with your new work. What kind of work are you doing?", "3533": "That's great that you were able to find a way to make it work. It sounds like you're making the best of a difficult situation. Is there anything I can do to help?", "3534": "That's great to hear! What made you so happy?", "3535": "That's amazing! What do you think has contributed to your happiness?", "3536": "That sounds really unpleasant. Did you get any rest or were you up all night coughing?", "3537": "That sounds awful. I'm glad you're feeling better now. Is there anything I can do to help?", "3538": "That is really frustrating. Is there anything I can do to help?", "3539": "That's a tough situation. Is there any way you can prove to her that you didn't do it?", "3540": "That sounds like a likely explanation. It's probably best to just let it go.", "3541": "It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed. It's understandable to feel uncertain at this time. Are there any specific concerns that you have?", "3542": "It is normal to feel overwhelmed and uncertain. Parenting is a huge responsibility and it can be a lot to take in. Have you talked to your wife about your concerns? Maybe she can help alleviate some of your worries.", "3543": "That sounds really cool! It's so amazing when animals show us affection like that. Did you get to pet it?", "3544": "That's probably true. It's always best to be cautious around cats, even if they seem friendly.

But it's important to remember why you two decided to go your separate ways. Have you been able to find closure with the situation?", "3549": "I agree. Police officers should always prioritize safety when responding to a call. It's important for them to follow the same rules of the road that everyone else does.", "3550": "That must have been quite a sight! What happened next?", "3551": "That sounds really dangerous. I can understand why you were so scared. It's important that police officers drive safely in all circumstances, even when responding to a call.", "3552": "What happened?", "3553": "Oh no! That must have been really scary. Have you looked in all the likely hiding places?", "3554": "That must have been really scary. Have you been able to look for it since then?", "3555": "That's amazing! It must be so cool to have a sister with such talent.

Is there anything I can do to help you?", "3566": "Yes, there are treatments that can help you have children. There are also support groups you can join to talk to other people who have gone through the same thing and can offer guidance and advice. You don't have to go through this alone.", "3567": "That sounds like a lot of fun! Do you still have those friends?", "3568": "It's always nice to take a trip down memory lane. What were some of your favorite memories from those summers? ", "3569": "That's great! How did it go?", "3570": "I'm sorry to hear that. What do you think you could have done differently?", "3571": "Wow, that sounds really impressive! What has you feeling so annoyed? ", "3572": "I'm sure your dad is proud of you and all that you have accomplished. It sounds like you were really close to the discovery, and that's still something to be proud of.", "3573": "That sounds really tough. It's hard to do something like that alone. Was it a movie that you wanted to see?", "3574": "That sounds like it would have been more fun with friends. Have you seen it before?", "3575": "That's really frustrating! Is there anything I can do to help?", "3576": "That's really frustrating. Have you talked to him about it?", "3577": "That does seem pretty unfair. What do you think YouTube should have done instead?", "3578": "It could be that people are using the midterms as an excuse to take action, but it's still unfortunate that Alex Jones was banned.", "3579": "Oh no! That must have been really scary for you. How did you react?", "3580": "That must have been really uncomfortable. I'm sorry you had to experience that.", "3581": "Oh no, that must be so hard for you. How are you feeling right now?", "3582": "I can only imagine how hurt and betrayed you must feel. Have you talked to her about it?", "3583": "That must have been a difficult decision to make. How did you handle it? ", "3584": "That was very generous of you. Did you get to say goodbye before he left?", "3585": "That must be really disappointing. Is there anything you can do to help him improve his grade this year? ", "3586": "Don't be too hard on yourself or your son. He's still doing well and B is a great grade. It's more important that he understands the material and learns the subject than getting an A. Plus, he's still young and has plenty of time to improve.", "3587": "Wow, that is amazing! How did you discover this?", "3588": "Ha ha, that sounds funny! It's great that you can understand him though. What sort of topics does he usually talk about?", "3589": "Wow, that's incredible! You must feel really proud of your accomplishment.", "3590": "Ha! I look forward to it. I'm sure it will be an epic battle!", "3591": "That's so sweet of him! How did he help?", "3592": "I'm glad to hear that. Is there anything else I can do to help?", "3593": "That sounds like a nice memory.

I'm truly impressed. I guess he's a genius! How did he even come across the problem?", "3599": "I'm sorry to hear that. It must be really disappointing. What do you think you can do now to increase your chances of getting a promotion in the future?", "3600": "I completely understand. Have you tried talking to someone else in the company, like a mentor or a supervisor? It might be worth a shot to get their advice and see if they can help you find another path to get the promotion.", "3601": "I'm so sorry to hear that. It's never easy when a pet dies. Is there anything I can do to help you or your roommate during this difficult time?", "3602": "That must have been a shock. Is there anything I can do to help?", "3603": "I'm so sorry to hear that. It can be really hard to adjust to life after a breakup. Is there anything I can do to help you through this difficult time?", "3604": "That must be really tough. I'm sorry you're going through this.

I'm glad you were able to get it under control.", "3613": "Why are you worried about travelling to Dubai?", "3614": "I understand your concern. Have you done any research into the culture and customs of Dubai? It might be helpful to learn a bit more about the city before you travel.", "3615": "Oh no, that's not good. Did you go back to check if it's still there?", "3616": "That's good to hear! Do you remember what time you left it there?", "3617": "That's understandable.

I'm glad you're feeling so confident about it!", "3625": "That's understandable. What are you most nervous about?", "3626": "That's understandable. Have you done any research on the company or the job you're applying for? That can help you feel more prepared and confident going into the interview.", "3627": "That's really great! It's nice to have something to look forward to, especially when you're stuck at home. Is there anything else you're excited about doing?", "3628": "Absolutely! Cleaning can be so therapeutic. It's great that you can now do that for yourself.", "3629": "That's amazing! It must be so difficult for her to manage all of that. How do you think she's doing?", "3630": "That's great to hear. It sounds like she is a natural at it.", "3631": "That sounds like a worry. Do you think that you'll be able to adjust to the new environment? ", "3632": "That makes sense. Moving can be a hassle but it can be worth it to get away from people who make your life difficult. Have you been looking around for a new place yet? What kind of things are you looking for in an apartment?", "3633": "Wow, that's really brave! How has the experience been so far? Have you been able to see and do a lot of different things?", "3634": "That sounds amazing! I'm so happy to hear that it has been such a positive experience. Are there any moments that have been particularly memorable?", "3635": "Yes, I do. It's natural to look back fondly on a time in our lives that we remember as being simpler or more carefree. It's okay to take a moment to appreciate those memories. Have you found any ways to cope with this feeling?", "3636": "I totally understand. It can be nice to take a break from the hustle and bustle of life and go back to a simpler time. It's a great way to relax and take a break from the stress of everyday life.", "3637": "That sounds like a really tough feeling.

That can be a great way to reconnect with people you've lost touch with.", "3639": "That's really nice of him! It's always nice to see people going out of their way to help others. It's a great reminder that there's still good in the world.", "3640": "That is so kind of him! It's really great that he was willing to go above and beyond to help you out. It's nice to see people being so considerate and generous.", "3641": "That sounds like it was a lot of fun. How long have you two been friends?", "3642": "That must be really hard. Is there any way you can keep in touch with her regularly?", "3643": "That sounds like such a peaceful and relaxing way to spend your time. What kind of books do you like to read?", "3644": "Yes, it definitely does. I enjoy reading fantasy and science fiction books. It's a great way to escape from reality for a while and get lost in a different world. What do you like about reading historical novels and legal dramas?", "3645": "I'm so sorry to hear that. What did you see that made you feel that way?", "3646": "That sounds really disheartening. What kind of buildings are they?", "3647": "That must be really disheartening. Is there anything you can do to help stop the destruction of your home village?", "3648": "That's understandable. It's hard to forget the place where you grew up. What do you think you can do to help preserve the beauty of your home village?", "3649": "That's great! It sounds like you really enjoy taking care of your pup. What kind of things do you do to make sure he has everything he needs?", "3650": "That's so sweet! What's his name?", "3651": "Wow! That sounds like an amazing surprise. How did you feel when they kidnapped you?", "3652": "That's really brave of you to go along with it! Did you have any idea where they were taking you?", "3653": "I understand. It can be really hard to see people in need. What do you think can be done to help them?", "3654": "That's really admirable of you. It sounds like you have a lot of empathy for them. Is there anything else you do to help those in need?", "3655": "That's great! What are you planning to do with the money?", "3656": "That's understandable. Have you thought about what you might do with it? Saving it, investing it, or spending it on something special?", "3657": "That's a great idea. Saving money is always a smart move.", "3658": "That sounds really tough. I'm sorry you had to go through that. Is there anything I can do to help you feel better now?", "3659": "That's understandable. What kind of things do you do now to feel connected?", "3660": "Oh no! That's so frustrating. Is there anything I can do to help?", "3661": "It's understandable to feel mad, but it's also understandable to feel bad about it too. It's normal to feel conflicting emotions in situations like this. Maybe you could try to think of a way to keep your cat from playing with your shoes in the future.", "3662": "That's great! What was the prize?", "3663": "That sounds like it would have been a great prize to win. I'm sorry that you didn't win. Did you still have fun performing?", "3664": "Oh wow, that's great! What kind of sausage is it?", "3665": "That's great! I'm glad it worked out. Did you enjoy the flavor?", "3666": "I'm so sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to help?", "3667": "It really is. It's hard to see a loved one in pain and not be able to do anything to help. It can be really emotional and overwhelming. Is there anything I can do to help?", "3668": "That's wonderful! How long will you be staying?", "3669": "That sounds amazing! I'm sure you're really looking forward to seeing them again. How long will you be there?", "3670": "That's incredible! Congratulations to your parents! It must have taken a lot of hard work and dedication to reach that goal. How do you think they felt when they got their diplomas?", "3671": "That's true, and it's really inspiring to see them setting such a good example. Congratulations to them!", "3672": "That sounds like a great adventure! Do you need any help packing or getting ready?", "3673": "Wow, that's quite a feat!

How rare is it?", "3687": "Wow, that must have been really scary. What did you do?", "3688": "That must have been really scary. Did you ever find out why it was barking so much?", "3689": "Yes, it's amazing how quickly technology has advanced in such a short amount of time. It's almost hard to keep up with all the new developments. What do you think has been the most impressive development?", "3690": "That's true! What kind of features do you think are the most impressive?", "3691": "That sounds like a lot of cake! How did that make you feel?", "3692": "I understand how tempting it can be, but you know it's not good for you to eat so much in one sitting. What can you do to make sure you don't do this again?", "3693": "That's really generous of you! It must make you feel good to know that you can help them when they need it.", "3694": "That's really admirable of you to be willing to help your family out financially. Do you know what kind of help they might need in the future?", "3695": "That must have been really scary. Was it worth it?", "3696": "That must have been really scary! Did you enjoy it?", "3697": "That's great! It's always nice to have a lot of options for shopping and dining. What are some of the places you like to go? ", "3698": "That sounds great! It's so nice to have a variety of options. I'm sure it's convenient to have everything close by. Do you have any other favorite places to shop or dine?", "3699": "That sounds really unpleasant. Is there anything that helps you get through it?", "3700": "I can understand why that would be unpleasant. Is there anything you can do to make it easier for yourself? Maybe wear gloves or use a utensil when you're doing dishes? ", "3701": "That must be really frustrating. Is there a way you can work with them to find a better solution?", "3702": "It sounds like you've tried to make it as easy as possible for them, but they just don't seem to take the hint. Have you talked to them about it?", "3703": "That's really frustrating. It's dangerous too, and can cause accidents. Have you experienced this firsthand?", "3704": "I can understand why that would make you mad. It's disrespectful and dangerous. Have you ever experienced it firsthand?", "3705": "Oh no, that's terrible! Do you know who did it?", "3706": "I'm so sorry that happened. Do you know who did it?", "3707": "Why were you holding off?", "3708": "I understand that it can be difficult to take a leap of faith and try something new. Have you seen what's on the menu? That might help you decide if it's worth the risk.", "3709": "That sounds amazing! Where is the store located? I'd love to check it out.", "3710": "That's great! I'm sure it's really nice to have a little taste of home. How long have you been living here?", "3711": "That sounds like a lot of hard work. How has it been going?", "3712": "That sounds like a lot of fun! What do you think you need to work on the most to get the edge on your competition?", "3713": "That must be really annoying. Have you talked to them about it?", "3714": "That's really annoying. Have you talked to him about it?", "3715": "I know, it's so frustrating. Have you talked to your neighbour about it?", "3716": "That's so frustrating. Have you thought about talking to him directly? That might be the most effective way to get him to stop.", "3717": "That's a really wise perspective. It's important to make the most of the time we have and to take advantage of the opportunities that come our way.", "3718": "That sounds like a lot of fun! Have you been to any of her concerts before?", "3719": "That sounds like it's going to be a great show. Are you planning on going alone or with friends?", "3720": "That's great news! Congratulations! How long have you been searching for a place?", "3721": "That's great! I'm sure it will be a nice place to live.", "3722": "Yes, I do. It's been a great experience, but I'm ready to move out soon.", "3723": "Oh no! That must have been so scary. Did you manage to get rid of it?", "3724": "That's understandable. It's normal to be disgusted by bugs like that. Is there anything I can do to help?", "3725": "That's a long drive! Is there anything I can do to help make it easier? Do you need company or anything?", "3726": "That's a great way to stay alert and focused. I'm sure you'll make the drive in no time. Good luck!", "3727": "Wow, that's awesome! What kind of computer did you get?", "3728": "That sounds great! What do you plan to do with it?", "3729": "That sounds like a great service! I'm glad it's helpful for you. Is there anything else that you find helpful in terms of getting groceries?", "3730": "That's understandable. It can be a hassle and time consuming. I'm glad you have a service like that to help you out.", "3731": "That sounds like it was a really tough movie to watch. How did you feel after watching it?", "3732": "I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like it's a really emotional movie. What was it about?", "3733": "That's amazing! How old is he?", "3734": "That's amazing!

Did you get any medical attention for it?", "3737": "Oh no! That sounds really unpleasant. Are you okay? Is there anything I can do to help?", "3738": "I can understand why you would be mad. Is there anything I can do to help?", "3739": "That must have been really scary! What did it sound like?", "3740": "That is definitely strange! Did you manage to get any sleep afterwards?", "3741": "Wow, that sounds like an amazing experience! Where did you go?", "3742": "That's quite the list! What was the most memorable experience you had? ", "3743": "Wow, that's amazing! It sounds like you have some very responsible kids.", "3744": "It sounds like you had a great vacation and it's nice to come home to a clean house.

How was it?", "3747": "That sounds like so much fun! How was the view from the top?", "3748": "Oh no! That sounds really painful. Are you okay? Is there anything I can do to help?", "3749": "That's a bummer. Is there anything else you can do to make it feel better?", "3750": "I'm so sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to help?", "3751": "That must be really hard. Is there anything I can do to help?", "3752": "That's great to hear! How long ago was it?", "3753": "I'm so glad it worked out for you! That must have been a difficult road to go down.", "3754": "That sounds like it would be a great change for you. What is making you so eager to move?", "3755": "That sounds like a great opportunity for them. Have you already found a place to move to in California?", "3756": "That's really upsetting. What do you think can be done to stop it?", "3757": "I hear you. It's really frustrating to see people disrespect the environment like that. Have you considered talking to your local government about increasing their efforts to reduce littering? That way you can help make a difference without risking your own safety.", "3758": "That sounds really lonely. Do you ever get to see other people? Is there any way to connect with people in your area?", "3759": "That's a really positive way to look at it! It's great that you have the animals to keep you company.", "3760": "That sounds really disappointing. Is there anything I can do to help?", "3761": "That's really frustrating. Is there anything you can do to try to get the cards you want?", "3762": "I understand how hard it can be to leave your pet behind. Is there anything I can do to help make the situation easier for you?", "3763": "That sounds like a good plan. It's understandable that you feel bad about leaving your pup behind, but it's important that you take some time to relax and enjoy your vacation. Is there anything else you can do to make her time away more comfortable? Maybe you can bring some of her favorite toys or treats to the kennel so she feels more at home.", "3764": "That's great! It's always a good idea to have more than one option. Have you heard back from any of them yet?", "3765": "I understand. That can be difficult. Have you been doing any networking or researching to increase your chances of finding something better?", "3766": "That's great! What kind of tickets did you buy?", "3767": "That would be really awesome! What are the odds of you winning? Have you looked into it?", "3768": "I'm so sorry to hear that. What can I do to help?", "3769": "I understand. It must be hard to think about leaving after living there for so long. Have you looked into any other options to make your neighborhood safer?", "3770": "That sounds like a lovely evening. How was it?", "3771": "That feeling can be really powerful. Did it make you feel small or inspired?", "3772": "Wow, that must have been a nice surprise! How did they all manage to come together?", "3773": "That must have been really nice to have them come and celebrate your child's birthday. How old did they turn?", "3774": "Oh, that's great! What kind of shoes did you get?", "3775": "Oh no! That's so frustrating. Did you take them back to the store to exchange them?", "3776": "I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to help?", "3777": "I understand. Have you tried reaching out to customer service? They might be able to provide some assistance in getting your Fitbit set up properly.", "3778": "That sounds intimidating. What kind of speech is it?", "3779": "That's understandable. Have you done any practice runs?", "3780": "Oh no, that must be so frustrating! What can I do to help?", "3781": "That's good. Have you been back to check if it's still there?", "3782": "Wow, that's impressive! How long did it take you to learn?", "3783": "That's really impressive! It must be nice to have a good memory like that. Have you been able to use it for other things?", "3784": "That sounds like it could be pretty intense. Are you feeling okay?", "3785": "That sounds really stressful. Is there anything I can do to help?", "3786": "Oh, no! That's awful. Did you report it to the police?", "3787": "I'm so sorry to hear that. That must have been really upsetting. Is there anything I can do to help?", "3788": "Oh no, that must have been really tough to see. How did you handle it?", "3789": "That sounds awful. Did the doctors say what caused it?", "3790": "Wow, that's amazing! It must have been incredible to witness.", "3791": "Wow, that must have been really impressive. What was your reaction?", "3792": "That sounds like a really unique experience! How was it?", "3793": "That sounds like so much fun! Did you get to pet any of them?", "3794": "What happened?", "3795": "Oh no! I can only imagine how scary that must have been. Did you manage to get rid of it?", "3796": "Oh no! That's a bummer. Have you tried using a lint roller to get the hair off?", "3797": "That's a good idea. Maybe you can give them some extra attention to make up for it. Cats love being petted and it could be a nice way to show them you still love them.", "3798": "I'm sorry to hear that. It's always hard to lose a pet. It sounds like you had a special bond with her.", "3799": "Yes, it does. Cancer is so cruel. I'm sorry that your roommate had to go through that.", "3800": "That sounds like a really nice way to remember times gone by. Music is a powerful way to bring back memories. What kind of songs do you like to listen to?", "3801": "Ah, I can relate. Music can be so powerful in evoking memories. It's nice to have those memories to look back on. Do you still listen to the same music?", "3802": "Oh no, that must have been scary! What did you do?", "3803": "It's totally understandable! I'm sure a lot of people would have done the same. It's natural to be scared of the unknown.", "3804": "Oh no, that's so sad! What did you do?", "3805": "That's so kind of you to help the bird. I'm sure the wildlife rescue center will be able to help it.", "3806": "That's understandable. It can be hard to wait for someone you're excited to see. Is there anything I can do to help you pass the time?", "3807": "That sounds delicious! What are you making with the roast?", "3808": "That's fantastic news! Congratulations!", "3809": "That sounds like a great plan! Where do you plan on going?", "3810": "That sounds stressful. Is there anything I can do to help?", "3811": "That sounds really frustrating. Is there a way you can set boundaries with them or ask them to give you some space?", "3812": "That sounds really boring! Do you have any hobbies you can do while he's away? Maybe you can pick up a new hobby or try something you haven't done in a while.", "3813": "Have you tried reaching out to other friends or family that you could hang out with? That way you don't have to do everything alone.", "3814": "Oh no, that sounds really serious. What are the symptoms you have noticed?", "3815": "I'm so sorry to hear that.

How did it make you feel?", "3820": "That's a great idea! It's always nice to show appreciation for people who do nice things for you.", "3821": "Oh no, that sounds like it could be quite a mess. Is there anything that you need to do to prepare?", "3822": "That's a good idea. It's always better to be prepared for the worst. Do you need any help? I'm sure I can spare some supplies. ", "3823": "That must have been a surprise. How are you feeling about it?", "3824": "That's really inconvenient. Is there anything I can do to help?", "3825": "That sounds delicious! What inspired you to make it?", "3826": "That sounds delicious! What other ingredients do you like to add to your mac and cheese?", "3827": "That sounds great! What did you get?", "3828": "That sounds like a great idea! What kind of style is it?", "3829": "I'm sorry to hear that. What kind of accidents is your dog having?", "3830": "That could be it. Have you tried using a pet odor neutralizer to help her get used to the new scent?", "3831": "That's great! It's always nice to be recognized for your hard work. How has it been so far?", "3832": "That's true. It can be hard to break through the ranks and be seen as a leader when there are already established people in the workplace. It's a great accomplishment to have achieved that.", "3833": "That sounds like a lot of fun! What are you most looking forward to?", "3834": "That's great! I'm sure they'll have a lot of fun.

How are you feeling about it?", "3844": "I'm sorry for your loss. Was she a part of your family for a long time?", "3845": "That's wonderful! It must be so rewarding to see your daughter's talent and creativity shine. How did she react when she found out she won the award?", "3846": "That's really great. How does she feel about the award?", "3847": "Oh no! What happened?", "3848": "That sounds like you were very prepared. What made you think to be so prepared?", "3849": "That must have been really annoying. What did you do to get rid of it?", "3850": "That must have been so irritating. Did you eventually get it out of the room?", "3851": "Oh no! That sounds like a really unpleasant experience. Is your dog okay?", "3852": "Yeah, that would be pretty gross. I hope she's okay. Have you taken her to the vet?", "3853": "That sounds like a lot of hard work! How is it going?", "3854": "That sounds great! How long is the speech?", "3855": "Oh no! That sounds really unpleasant. Is your cat okay now?", "3856": "That sounds like a good idea. Maybe you can set a reminder for yourself to give her the jelly every few weeks? That should help reduce the number of hairballs she produces.", "3857": "Oh no! That must have been so embarrassing. How did you manage to get through it?", "3858": "That's true. It's unfortunate that some people don't think before they act. It must have been really hard for you to go through that.", "3859": "That sounds delicious! What kind of pizza did you get?", "3860": "I'm sorry to hear that. Is there a particular reason why you didn't like it?", "3861": "That sounds really stressful. Did you have anyone to help you?", "3862": "That sounds really stressful. I'm glad you eventually made it to your AirBnB. Did you have any other difficulties while you were in Costa Rica?", "3863": "Oh no! That must have been a terrifying experience. What happened next?", "3864": "That's ok, maybe running isn't your thing, but there are plenty of other activities you can do to stay active and healthy. Have you ever tried cycling or yoga?", "3865": "That must have been exciting. How was it?", "3866": "I see. Do you regret it?", "3867": "That's wonderful! What did you have?", "3868": "It sounds like you were able to relax and enjoy the moment. That's wonderful.", "3869": "Oh no! Are you okay?

Have you tried to figure out why she's doing that?", "3876": "That's gross! Is there anything you can do to prevent it from happening again?", "3877": "Oh no! That's not good. Did you call the library to see if they have it?", "3878": "Oh no, that's too bad. Is there any way you can salvage it?", "3879": "That's so sweet! What kind did he get you?", "3880": "That's really sweet of him. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about?", "3881": "That sounds really frustrating. Can you tell me more about what's been happening?", "3882": "That could be an option, but it's a big decision and it's not easy. Have you looked into other ways to reduce your taxes, such as appealing your assessment or looking into tax credits?", "3883": "It sounds like you're feeling frustrated with the situation. Is there anything you can do to make it better?", "3884": "No, I don't have a partner. What do you mean when you say you always do the same when it's perfect?", "3885": "That's great news! I'm so happy for you! How long have you been looking for a new house?", "3886": "That's great to hear!

Is there anything I can do to help you through this difficult time?", "3894": "It was sudden and unexpected. He was healthy one day and gone the next.

Have you looked into any resources that might help you find a job?", "3909": "That must have been really hard to hear. Is there anything I can do to help?", "3910": "That must be very difficult for them. Is there anything they can do to try to get a better deal?", "3911": "Oh no! Are you okay? Did you get hurt?", "3912": "That's understandable. Are you okay now?", "3913": "Yes, I love playing video games. What kind of games do you like?", "3914": "Yes, I'm looking forward to it as well. I heard it's going to be quite different from the previous games in the series. What do you think?", "3915": "Yes, it can be really frustrating when your friends are making more money than you, especially when you feel like you're putting in the same amount of effort. It's understandable that this would make you feel like you're not being fairly compensated.", "3916": "It's understandable to feel jealous, but it's important to remember that everyone has their own unique path in life. What works for someone else might not work for you. Focus on what you can do to improve your own situation and don't compare yourself to others.", "3917": "That's great to hear! How did you manage to do so well?", "3918": "That's great to hear! I'm glad you're feeling more confident. It's true, the year can only get better from here.

How did you prepare for today?", "3920": "That's amazing! Congratulations! I'm so happy for you. What does the promotion entail?", "3921": "Oh my goodness, that sounds awful! How are you feeling now? Are you still in pain or dealing with any lingering effects?", "3922": "That's so frightening! Did you get medical attention?", "3923": "Yes, I do! I used to love playing those games. They always brought me so much joy and excitement. What was your favorite game?", "3924": "I definitely will! It's always a great feeling to revisit those memories.", "3925": "I'm doing okay. I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with all the things I have to do, but I'm managing. How about you? Are you enjoying life?", "3926": "Me too! It's always nice to have something to look forward to.", "3927": "Wow, that's a lot to ask. Do you feel comfortable giving her a key?", "3928": "That was a really trusting thing to do and it doesn't sound like she was being respectful of your boundaries. Have you talked to her about it yet?", "3929": "Oh no, that's too bad. Is there anything I can do to help?", "3930": "I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you were really looking forward to it. Is there anything I can do to help?", "3931": "Oh no! That must have been so unpleasant for you. Did you manage to get it cleaned up okay?", "3932": "That's good to hear. Is your dog feeling better now?", "3933": "I'm so sorry to hear that. What happened?", "3934": "That must have been really hard.

That's so disappointing. Are you feeling guilty about it?", "3940": "That does sound like a tricky situation. Is there a way you could make it up to them? Maybe by buying them a new chocolate bar?", "3941": "Oh, wow! That must have taken a lot of courage. How did it feel when you finally jumped?", "3942": "That's really brave of you! How did it feel when you jumped?", "3943": "That's a great lesson to teach your kids. It's important to show them how to be respectful and compassionate to everyone. It's a valuable life skill that will serve them well.", "3944": "It's definitely a challenge. Have you tried talking to the other parents?", "3945": "I can only imagine! It must take a lot of time and effort to create something like that. Do you know someone who works in the video game industry?", "3946": "That's incredible! It's amazing to think about all the time and effort that goes into creating a game.", "3947": "That must have been a difficult situation. How did you handle it?", "3948": "Yeah, I can understand that. It's great that you have a partner who you respect enough to make that decision.", "3949": "Oh wow, how was it?", "3950": "That's really special. What was your favorite part?", "3951": "That sounds great! How much did you make?", "3952": "That's great that you have that confidence in the company. What made you decide to keep your stake?", "3953": "Wow, that must have been so exciting! How did she handle it?", "3954": "It's amazing how quickly they grow up! Is she excited about going to school?", "3955": "That's a lot of money. Is he able to pay you back soon?", "3956": "I see. That sounds like a risky investment. Have you discussed a timeline for repayment with him?", "3957": "That sounds like a really exciting way to celebrate! Did you end up going?", "3958": "That does sound scary! Are you still planning to go skydiving for your birthday?", "3959": "Oh no! That must have been embarrassing. Did anyone else notice?", "3960": "Oh no! That must have been embarrassing. Did anyone say anything?", "3961": "That's awful! What an awful thing to do! How are you feeling?", "3962": "That's really unfortunate. Are you okay? Is there anything I can do to help?", "3963": "I'm sorry to hear that. It must be a difficult task to undertake. Is there anything I can do to help?", "3964": "I understand. It's perfectly understandable that you would want to make sure everything goes well. It must have been very difficult to plan it out, but I'm sure you did an excellent job.", "3965": "That's a long time! What do you do?", "3966": "That's great to hear! What do you like most about it? ", "3967": "That sounds like an amazing job! What do you like most about it?", "3968": "That must have been really stressful for you. Did they end up canceling the flight?", "3969": "That's great that you were able to get on the flight! I'm sure it was a relief. How was your trip overall?", "3970": "Wow, that sounds like a lot of food! Did you enjoy it?", "3971": "That sounds like it was worth it!", "3972": "That sounds like a really nice trip! How was it seeing the old places and remembering the old times?", "3973": "I know what you mean. It's always nice to be able to look back on the past. Did you have any fun activities or moments that you particularly enjoyed?", "3974": "I'm so sorry to hear that. That must have been an incredibly difficult time for you. How did you cope with the loss?", "3975": "I'm so sorry for your loss. It sounds like it must have been very difficult for you. Is there anything I can do to help you?", "3976": "That sounds like such a special surprise! What did you do to celebrate?", "3977": "That's understandable. Did you have a good time otherwise?", "3978": "That sounds wonderful! What kind of things do you like to do together?", "3979": "That sounds like a great attitude to have. It's wonderful that you both are content with the way things are.", "3980": "Oh no, that's terrible! What did you do?", "3981": "That's really great that you had faith that someone would be honest and turn it in.  Did you get it back?", "3982": "That sounds like a really rewarding experience! How did it go?", "3983": "That sounds like a great experience. What did you do at the food bank?", "3984": "That's wonderful! It sounds like you're really enjoying life. What do you like most about your current situation?", "3985": "That's great to hear! It sounds like you've worked hard to get to where you are now.", "3986": "It's great that you have been able to recognize the value of your current situation.", "3987": "That sounds really frustrating. Is there anything I can do to help?", "3988": "That's really tough. Is there anything I can do to help?", "3989": "That makes sense. Is there anything I can do to help?", "3990": "Oh no! That sounds really embarrassing and uncomfortable. Are you okay?", "3991": "That's understandable. It can be embarrassing when that kind of thing happens in public.", "3992": "That's probably true. I'm glad you weren't seriously hurt though.", "3993": "That sounds really frustrating! Have you ever tried setting a timer for yourself so you don't check the tracking too often? That might help you manage your anticipation and impatience.", "3994": "It's understandable, I'm the same way. It's exciting to know something you ordered is on its way, and it's hard to not check the tracking to see when it will arrive.", "3995": "I'm so sorry to hear that. It must have been very difficult to lose her. Is there anything I can do to help you through this time?", "3996": "That's so sweet. It sounds like you had a really special bond with her. I'm sorry for your loss.", "3997": "That sounds like a great idea! What lake are you going to?", "3998": "Yes, that sounds like a great way to relax and enjoy some time with the family. Have you been to the lake before?", "3999": "That must be really nice for her. Is it difficult for you to be around her?", "4000": "That's admirable. It's not easy to make it on your own. Kudos to you for making it work.", "4001": "I totally understand that. It's hard to feel like you're missing out on opportunities because of your financial situation. Have you thought of looking into scholarships or grants that might help you out?", "4002": "That sounds like it was a lot of hard work! How did you stay motivated throughout the project?", "4003": "Wow, that sounds like a challenging project. How did you manage to get it done?", "4004": "That's great!

Is there anything I can do to help you out?", "4007": "That sounds really tough. Is there anything I can do to help you get back on track?", "4008": "That's really frustrating. It's hard to stay motivated when you don't see the results you want. Is there anything you can do to make yourself feel better? Maybe you can focus on the progress you've made overall, or set some new goals to work towards.", "4009": "That sounds stressful. Is there anything I can do to help you prepare?", "4010": "That's totally understandable. What have you been doing to help yourself feel more confident?", "4011": "Oh no, that sounds like a rough day. I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?", "4012": "That's great to hear! I'm glad you were able to make the best of it.", "4013": "That's wonderful to hear. It must be a great comfort to know you have such a supportive family. How do they help you?", "4014": "That is great to hear! It is always so comforting to know that you are loved and supported.", "4015": "I'm so sorry to hear that. It must have been a very difficult decision to make. How are you feeling now?", "4016": "I can imagine how hard it must have been. It's never easy to lose a pet that you've had for so long.", "4017": "That sounds like a difficult decision. What made you uncertain about it?", "4018": "That's true, but if you feel unsure about it, why not take it for a test drive? That might help you make up your mind.", "4019": "That's great to hear! It sounds like you have a really strong relationship. How do you make sure to stay connected?", "4020": "That's so sweet! It's clear he means a lot to you. What do you both enjoy doing together?", "4021": "Oh no! That sounds like it must have been really embarrassing. Did you get hurt?", "4022": "That's hilarious! I'm glad you weren't hurt.  Sounds like you had a great time at the party.  Did you do anything else fun?", "4023": "That sounds like a great idea!

I'm sure you worked hard and you deserved it.", "4031": "That must have been really hard for you. How did you cope with the situation?", "4032": "I have had to live in shelters, on the streets, and even in abandoned buildings. It was tough, but I was able to find help and get back on my feet.

How have you been finding the process?", "4040": "Wow, that sounds like a lot of pressure. How have you been preparing?", "4041": "Oh no! That must have been really embarrassing. How did you manage to get through it? ", "4042": "That must have been so embarrassing. I'm sorry you had to go through that. Is there anything I can do to help?", "4043": "That's understandable.

What has been helping you stay motivated?", "4046": "That's a great way to look at it. What has been the biggest improvement in your life since then?", "4047": "That sounds like a great goal! What have you been doing to try and reach it? ", "4048": "That's still really impressive. Have you been working on it for a while? What kind of training have you been doing?", "4049": "I'm sure that's not true. Have you tried any different techniques or strategies to improve your speed? It might just be that you need to find the right approach that works for you.", "4050": "Wow, that sounds like a great way to get motivated! Are you seeing the results you want?", "4051": "I understand, but it's important to be aware of the health risks. Have you talked to a doctor about it?", "4052": "That sounds great! It's always nice when you can feel progress in the gym. What other exercises have you been doing lately?", "4053": "Ah, I see. So you're saying that you felt a really good pump in your chest muscles after doing some bench presses?", "4054": "Ouch! That must have hurt. Are you okay? Do you need anything?", "4055": "That sounds like a good idea, but maybe you can find a way to remind him to put his toys away. If you do take them away, maybe you could give him back one at a time when he remembers to clean up. That way, he'll learn that good behavior is rewarded.", "4056": "Oh no, that sounds like it must have been really tough to see. What did you do?", "4057": "That's tough. Have you talked to her about it?", "4058": "That sounds really frustrating. It's understandable that you would be mad in that situation. Did anything else happen that made you feel better?", "4059": "That's too bad. Do you think you could have eaten more if you had more time?", "4060": "That sounds like a lot of money for a piece of cheesecake. Was it worth it?", "4061": "That sounds really disappointing. I'm sorry to hear that.", "4062": "That's an amazing goal! What have you been doing to reach it?", "4063": "That sounds like a great program! It's amazing how far you've come in 6 months. Have you noticed any changes in your body?", "4064": "That sounds really scary! Have you seen it?", "4065": "Sure, I'd be happy to. What kind of horror movies do you like?", "4066": "That sounds really tough. It's great that you were able to quit! Have you tried any relaxation techniques or activities to help you manage the stress?", "4067": "That's really cool! What did you do in this world?", "4068": "What kind of dare?", "4069": "That sounds really scary! Do you think you're going to do it?", "4070": "That's great! What kind of things do you like to do?", "4071": "That sounds like a great way to stay productive. What do you like most about crocheting? ", "4072": "That's great! It sounds like you had a really productive workout. What did you do?", "4073": "That sounds great! It's great that you're taking care of yourself and getting a good workout in.", "4074": "Oh no, that must have been a mess. What did you do?", "4075": "That was very responsible of you. I'm sure he appreciated it. Is there anything else you can do to make it up to him?", "4076": "That must have been really difficult for you. Are you feeling better now?", "4077": "I'm so sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to help?", "4078": "I can understand why you're feeling that way. It's natural to miss someone after a breakup. How have you been dealing with it?", "4079": "I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like it was a difficult decision.

I'm sorry you had to experience that. Is there anything I can do to help?", "4084": "I understand. That can be really tough. Is there anything I can do to help?", "4085": "That makes sense. Have you tried eating smaller meals more frequently? That might help you adjust to the larger portions.", "4086": "That's really inspiring! What do you admire about the US?", "4087": "That's a great question. What do you think it should be?", "4088": "That's so exciting! How many puppies are there?", "4089": "That's great news! Congratulations!", "4090": "Wow, that must have been really exciting and overwhelming! How did you react?", "4091": "That's hilarious! How did you eventually find out it was him? ", "4092": "That's understandable! How did it go? Did you enjoy it?", "4093": "I can understand why you would be nervous. Did you end up trying it?", "4094": "Oh no, that's too bad. Is it an expensive book? What do you think you should do?", "4095": "That's too bad. Is there any way you can make it up to your friend?", "4096": "Oh no, that's awful! Have you tried calling the store to see if they can help you?", "4097": "It's okay, I'm sure it was an honest mistake. Just go back to the store and pay for them. That's the best thing to do.", "4098": "Wow, that sounds amazing! What was the dress like?", "4099": "Wow, that sounds like a real showstopper! Did you get to talk to her?", "4100": "Wow, five years is a long time! How are you feeling about the appointment?", "4101": "That's really brave of you to go without insurance. Did they give you a good estimate of how much it will cost?", "4102": "That's really great to hear! It sounds like the internet has been a really important source of support for you.", "4103": "It really is. It's amazing how much information is available to us at the click of a button.", "4104": "Yes, it's so peaceful to watch them just rest. It's like they don't have a care in the world.", "4105": "I can understand that. Is there anything in particular that you find calming about watching animals sleep?", "4106": "Oh, no! I'm so sorry to hear that. How is your dog doing?", "4107": "I'm so sorry for your loss. Is there anything I can do to help?", "4108": "That sounds like it must have been a lot of fun.

Is there anything you can do to make the experience a little less bittersweet?", "4112": "That's great news! Congratulations on all your hard work.", "4113": "That is understandable. It's always good to take a break and relax after a tough semester. Is there anything you are looking forward to doing now that you have some free time?", "4114": "It's understandable that you were excited to let her take the car. It's a big step for her.

What kind of things do you talk about?", "4137": "I can understand why those topics would be difficult to discuss. Is there anything you do talk about that you enjoy?", "4138": "I'm so sorry for your loss. It must have been really hard for you. Is there anything I can do to help?", "4139": "I understand.

Did you manage to make it home alright?", "4239": "That sounds really scary. I'm glad you made it home safe. Do you think you'll be taking shorter trips in the future or avoiding late night drives? ", "4240": "That's really sweet of you! How have you been showing your support?", "4241": "That's really tough for your husband. Is there anything I can do to help? ", "4242": "That's understandable. It's natural to feel a little jealousy when someone you care about has something that you don't. How did you handle the feelings?", "4243": "I can understand why you might feel jealous in that situation. It's natural to want what others have, especially when it seems like they have it so easy.

Have you thought about joining any local clubs or organizations? That could be a great way to meet people with similar interests.", "4274": "I understand. It can be intimidating to go out by yourself. Have you looked into any local groups or activities that you could join? That could be a great way to meet new people in a comfortable environment.", "4275": "I'm sorry to hear that. That must be really disappointing.

It's the little things like that that make a big difference.", "4297": "That must be really tough. Have you reached out to any of your contacts to see if they know of any job opportunities?", "4298": "That's the spirit! I'm sure something will come up soon.

Do you think there was a reason why they didn't reach out?", "4302": "It's understandable to feel disappointed, but it's important to remember that everyone is busy and sometimes things slip our minds. It's not intentional and I'm sure they would want to wish you a happy birthday if they had remembered.", "4303": "That sounds really nice! It's great that you have found a sense of peace and contentment. What do you think has helped you to find that?", "4304": "Yes, that sounds like a wonderful idea!

Maybe you could even take a walk in the park and take in the beauty of nature.", "4305": "Oh no, that must have been really embarrassing. Is there anything I can do to help you feel better?", "4306": "I'm sorry that happened to you. It must have been embarrassing. Is there anything that you can do to make sure it doesn't happen again?", "4307": "That must be tough to deal with. Do you think it's because she's been around more often?", "4308": "That's so cute! It's nice to know he's still in your life. Maybe he just likes the extra attention she gives him. Have you tried giving him more attention to see if that helps?", "4309": "I'm so sorry for your loss.

That kind of dedication is really admirable. How did your husband do with quitting smoking?", "4322": "Wow, that sounds tough. It's admirable that you were willing to take on such a challenge to help your husband.", "4323": "I'm sorry you had to go through that. It sounds like it was a difficult situation. What did you do to try to resolve it? Have you and your daughter been able to talk it out since then?", "4324": "Absolutely. It's an opportunity to explain to her why it's okay to talk to your spouse about things, and how it's not the same as talking behind someone's back. It's important for her to understand that, and it sounds like you handled it well.", "4325": "That sounds like a really fun trip down memory lane! What were some of your favorite games?", "4326": "That sounds like a lot of fun! It's nice to take a break from the hustle and bustle of life and just relax with some old favorites.", "4327": "That's so disappointing. What happened?", "4328": "It's hard to take rejection, but don't let it get you down. It doesn't mean you're not good enough, it just means that job wasn't the right fit. Keep your head up and keep looking, something else will come along soon!", "4329": "That must have been really hard for you. It's great to hear that you're making positive changes and feeling more optimistic. Is there anything I can do to help support you?", "4330": "That's a great attitude to have.

How important is the sewing machine to you?", "4405": "I understand that it has sentimental value, but if you're not using it, you could always keep it in storage. That way, it's still around and you can still keep it in her memory, but it won't be taking up space in your new home.", "4406": "Wow, that's really impressive!

Did you ever tell him to stop?", "4421": "That must have been really uncomfortable for you. It's good that you knew how to stand up for yourself and not let him pressure you into something you didn't want.", "4422": "That's great news! What kind of work is it?", "4423": "That sounds like a great opportunity! How did you find out about it?", "4424": "I understand how you feel. It can be hard to see someone else receive something you wanted. Have you talked to her about how you're feeling?", "4425": "That sounds like a great prize! I'm sure you'll have other opportunities to win something in the future. Maybe you can plan a trip with her to Gatlinburg and make it a fun adventure for both of you.", "4426": "Wow, that must have been quite a sight! Where did you see this?", "4427": "That must have been a strange sight. Did you find it entertaining?", "4428": "Sounds like you've been really busy! Is there any way I can help?", "4429": "That makes sense. Is there anything I can do to help?", "4430": "I'm so sorry to hear that. That's really unfair. Did you report it to the police?", "4431": "That is really wrong. Have you contacted the police yet? What can I do to help?", "4432": "That must have been so exciting! How old is she now?", "4433": "That sounds so sweet! What kind of puppy was she?", "4434": "That must be difficult for you. Is there anything I can do to help?", "4435": "That's great! Just be sure to set some clear expectations and boundaries so that he understands what he needs to do.", "4436": "That's horrible! It's so disrespectful to treat someone like that. Was there anything you could do to help the homeless man?", "4437": "I completely agree. It's unacceptable behavior and it's heartbreaking to see. We need to do more to protect people like this man from being treated this way. It's just not right.", "4438": "That sounds really stressful. Is there anything I can do to help?", "4439": "I understand. It can be really tough to wait for news like this. Is there anything you can do in the meantime to help pass the time?", "4440": "I'm sorry to hear that. How are you feeling about it?", "4441": "It's hard when you really want something and don't get it. Is there anything I can do to help you feel better?", "4442": "Oh my goodness, that must have been so unpleasant! How are you feeling about it now?", "4443": "That's understandable! It's not something you'd want to witness everyday. Did you have to pull over and clean it up?", "4444": "That must be so exciting! How long have you been waiting for this news?", "4445": "That's understandable. Are you excited to find out or a little anxious?", "4446": "Oh no! That's terrible. Is there any way the library can help you out?", "4447": "It's understandable. Accidents happen. Do you think you can talk to the librarian and explain what happened? They may be willing to waive the fee.", "4448": "That's so sweet! It must have been a really special moment. What kind of toy was it?", "4449": "She was a German Shepherd. She was a great companion and I miss her a lot.", "4450": "That's great! Congratulations! How did you find the job?", "4451": "That's great!

Is there anything I can do to help you feel more confident?", "4454": "Oh no, what happened?", "4455": "That sounds really tough. Is there anything I can do to help?", "4456": "That's great to hear! It's so important to find a job that you enjoy and that offers a good work environment. It's really admirable that you've stayed with the same employer for so long.", "4457": "That sounds like a really interesting job. How long have you been working there?", "4458": "That sounds really impressive! What did you do?", "4459": "That's great! I'm sure you did a great job. What do you think they liked most about you?", "4460": "That sounds like a great opportunity! How did you prepare for the interview?", "4461": "That must be really hard for you. Is there anything I can do to help you adjust to the new city?", "4462": "Absolutely! It takes time to build relationships, but it's worth it in the end. Have you been able to meet anyone new yet?", "4463": "That sounds like a good decision. It's nice to have something that you can rely on.", "4464": "Exactly! It's nice to have something you can rely on.", "4465": "That sounds like a great idea. It's always nice to take a break and relax. Is there anything specific you had in mind that you'd like to do?", "4466": "That would be great! It would be nice to get some things done outside. Maybe we can both get our to-do lists done this weekend. ", "4467": "I'm so sorry to hear that. It must be very difficult for you to lose him after all these years. Is there anything I can do to help you through this?", "4468": "Yes, it is very sad. It sounds like you had a special bond with him. Is there anything I can do to help you through this difficult time?", "4469": "That's great! What all do you have in your kit?", "4470": "Oh wow, that's a great idea to be prepared. Is there anything else you need to do to get ready?", "4471": "That's so sweet of her! Is there anything else she's been doing to help you feel better?", "4472": "That's so sweet of her. It's great to have someone who takes such good care of you.", "4473": "I understand how important it is for you to be sure that your food is gluten free. Have you had any bad experiences in the past that make you extra cautious?", "4474": "That sounds really tough. Do you have any tips for making sure that restaurants take your request seriously?", "4475": "That's strange! Did you mention it to the waiter?", "4476": "That's really strange. Did they replace them with new ones?", "4477": "Wow, 14 already! That's incredible. It's amazing how quickly they grow up. It's nice that you saved some of their old clothes for a special project. That'll be a great way to keep the memories alive.", "4478": "That's a tough decision. It's nice that you have saved it this long. Do you think it will be special to make something out of it?", "4479": "That sounds like a great way to start the day! I'm glad you're feeling happy.", "4480": "That sounds like a great breakfast! It's wonderful that she takes such good care of you.", "4481": "That's lovely. I'm glad you're both happy together.", "4482": "You can't! It sounds like she's really looking out for you.", "4483": "That must be very exciting! I'm sure he will keep it a secret. Do you need any help with the proposal?", "4484": "That's great! I'm sure he'll do his best to keep it a secret!", "4485": "That's really admirable of you. What kind of support have you been providing?  Is there anything I can do to help? ", "4486": "That's so true. Having someone who believes in her and is willing to be there for her is so important. Is there anything else I can do to help?", "4487": "I'm sorry to hear that. It can be hard to see other people getting something that you want. Is there any way that you can save up to buy the car?", "4488": "That sounds like a really cool car. Is there any way you can save up to get one?", "4489": "That's a great start! Start saving where you can and you'll get there in no time. You can also look into financing options in case you need a bit of help. Good luck!", "4490": "Haha, it's worth a try! But saving is a sure way to get there. Start small and work your way up. Good luck!", "4491": "Oh no! That must have been so embarrassing! Is there any way I can help you with the potty training process?", "4492": "That's a relief! It sounds like you handled it well.", "4493": "That sounds like a great gift! When is his birthday?", "4494": "That sounds great! I'm sure he'll love it.", "4495": "That sounds amazing!

", "4498": "That must have been so scary for you. How is he doing now?", "4499": "That sounds like a really difficult situation to be in. Have you talked to anyone about it?", "4500": "That's great to hear! It's wonderful that you were able to find a way to connect with God and feel His presence. Praise God!", "4501": "That sounds like a difficult habit to break. Is there anything I can do to help you?", "4502": "That sounds like a delicious treat! Have you tried to find healthier alternatives? Maybe something like a banana and almond butter sandwich with dark chocolate chips? That would be a bit healthier and still satisfy your craving.", "4503": "That sounds like so much fun! How old is your son?", "4504": "That sounds like it was a great time! What was his favorite present? ", "4505": "That sounds like a great opportunity for you and your daughters. How can I help you make the most of it?", "4506": "That sounds really fun!

Is there anything I can do to help?", "4510": "That's concerning. Have you suggested that she see a doctor?", "4511": "That sounds really nice. What kind of cat do you have?", "4512": "That sounds so peaceful. Cats really do make the best companions!", "4513": "That sounds exciting! How did it go?", "4514": "That's understandable. How did you feel when you left the interview?", "4515": "That sounds like it must have been a peaceful and relaxing experience. How was it?", "4516": "That sounds wonderful! What did you do while you were there?", "4517": "Oh no, that sounds like it was a bit of a disaster. What happened?", "4518": "Yikes, that must have been awful.

How old is she?", "4521": "That must be really difficult for you. Is there anything I can do to help?", "4522": "That must be a difficult situation. Applying for disability can be a long process. Is there anything I can do to help?", "4523": "How did it go? Did you feel comfortable with them?", "4524": "I completely understand. It can be really intimidating to meet new people and start a new treatment plan. How did the session go?", "4525": "That must be a strange feeling for you! How are you feeling about it?", "4526": "I can imagine. It must be strange. What do you miss most about having them around?", "4527": "That sounds like it was really frustrating.

What countries are they visiting?", "4534": "Have you ever been to Europe before?", "4535": "That sounds like a lot of fun! How long has it been since you've seen them?", "4536": "That must be difficult. Have you been able to get together often?", "4537": "That's so nice that you all make the effort to see each other. It's great that you can stay connected even if you're all in different places.  How long did you all get to spend together?", "4538": "That sounds really frustrating. Is there anything I can do to help?", "4539": "I understand. It's hard when someone you love isn't honest with you. Have you tried talking to her about why it's important to you that she's honest? Maybe she could be more open if she knows how much it means to you. ", "4540": "That's really upsetting. Can you tell me more about what happened?", "4541": "That's understandable. It's hard to know how to intervene in situations like that. It sounds like you did the right thing.", "4542": "That's really too bad. It's unfortunate that people still have that attitude. Have you ever experienced anything like that before?", "4543": "That sounds really disappointing. Is there any way you can still make it happen?", "4544": "That must be tough.

Is there anything I can do to help you?", "4686": "It sounds like she was a great source of strength and comfort for you. It's understandable that you would still miss her after all this time. Is there anything I can do to help you feel better?", "4687": "Yes, it does. It can be hard to accept that, but it's true. Is there anything I can do to help you?", "4688": "That must be hard for you. It's natural for parents to want to keep their children close, but you have to trust that you have done your job and prepared them for the world. It will be difficult, but it's important to let them go and experience life on their own.", "4689": "That sounds like a difficult balance to maintain. It's important that they feel comfortable talking to you about anything, but it's also understandable that you want to make sure they're making good decisions. Have you found any good strategies for navigating this transition?", "4690": "Oh no, that must have been so scary! How did you manage to stay calm through all of that?", "4691": "That's so great to hear! It must have been a huge relief when you knew your baby was okay. I'm glad everything turned out alright in the end.", "4692": "Wow, that's really impressive! How long did it take you to get to that level?", "4693": "That sounds like a lot of work! How long did it take you to beat level 150?", "4694": "Oh no! What did you do?", "4695": "Oh, no. That doesn't sound good at all. Has she been doing this for a while?", "4696": "Oh no, that must have been scary! Are you feeling better now?", "4697": "That's understandable. What did the doctor say?", "4698": "That sounds really tough. I'm sorry you had to go through that. Is there anything I can do to help you feel better?", "4699": "That must have been really embarrassing for you. Is there anything I can do to help you feel better?", "4700": "That's wonderful! How long has she been in college for?", "4701": "That's great! I'm sure you both will be glad to have some quality time together.", "4702": "I'm so sorry to hear that. How has it been for you since then? Has it been hard to adjust to the diagnosis?", "4703": "I'm so sorry to hear that. How have you been coping since then?", "4704": "Oh, no! That must be difficult for you. Is there anything I can do to help?", "4705": "I understand that you must be feeling really hurt and betrayed. Is there anything I can do to help?", "4706": "Oh no, that must be nerve-wracking! Have you given her any advice?", "4707": "That's great. I'm sure she will be careful and return the car in the same condition. Have you talked to her about driving safely?", "4708": "That's great! Are you feeling confident?", "4709": "That's great. What do you feel like you need to do to do your best?", "4710": "Oh wow, that sounds really nice! What was the song? ", "4711": "That's understandable, it's nice to take a moment to remember the good times. What was it about the song that made you feel so nostalgic?", "4712": "I'm so sorry to hear that. How are you feeling?", "4713": "I can only imagine how difficult it must have been for you. Do you have any support systems that you can lean on during this time?", "4714": "I'm so sorry to hear that. What can I do to help?", "4715": "I'm so sorry that you weren't able to be there for her. Is there anything I can do to help?", "4716": "That sounds like a great way to end the day! What did you have?", "4717": "That sounds delicious! What kind of beverage did you have?", "4718": "That sounds really tough. How did you manage to stay confident in yourself?", "4719": "It can be hard to trust people, especially when starting something new. Have you been able to build any relationships with your coworkers?", "4720": "That sounds really difficult. Have you tried gradually reducing your soda intake over time? That might help you manage the withdrawal symptoms while still helping you reach your goal. Are there any other strategies you have tried or considered?", "4721": "I understand. It's hard to break an addiction, but I believe that with God's help, you can do it. Have you tried any other methods to help you quit? Maybe you could replace soda with healthier drinks like water or tea. You could also try distracting yourself with activities when you feel the urge to drink soda.", "4722": "That sounds really stressful. How have you been dealing with the wait?", "4723": "That's a long time to wait. Have you been applying to other jobs in the meantime?", "4724": "That sounds really frustrating. What do you think would be the best way to handle this situation?", "4725": "I'm sure they will. Kids can be forgetful sometimes. Have you thought of a way to help them remember not to do it again?", "4726": "That sounds really tough. Can I ask what was keeping you up?", "4727": "That sounds really tough. Is there anything I can do to help?", "4728": "Oh no, that must have been hard to see. How did you feel when you saw that?", "4729": "That was probably the best thing to do. It's not easy to let things go, but it's usually the best choice. Is there anything you need to talk about?", "4730": "Oh no, that must have been really scary. What did you do?", "4731": "That was smart. I'm glad you stayed safe.", "4732": "That must have been a really special moment for you. How did it feel?", "4733": "It's such a special moment, and it's something you'll never forget.", "4734": "That must have been really hard for you. It's understandable to forget something like that, but it's still hard to come to terms with. Is there anything I can do to help?", "4735": "That's great to hear. I'm sure she appreciated it.", "4736": "Wow, that's really cool! How long has it been since you played paintball?", "4737": "That sounds like so much fun! Have you told your dad about it?", "4738": "Wow, that must have been an incredible experience! How did it feel when you jumped out of the plane?", "4739": "That's great that you were able to push yourself to do something that scared you. What was the experience like?", "4740": "That must have been really hard for you. Did you stay in touch with the dog after it was gone?", "4741": "I can imagine. It's never easy to lose something you love. Is there anything you can do to honor your beloved pet?", "4742": "Oh no, that sounds embarrassing. Are you okay?", "4743": "That's a relief! Do you need any help getting up?", "4744": "That sounds really special. What made you decide to look for it?", "4745": "That's really special. It's so nice that you have something to remember her by.", "4746": "Congratulations! That's amazing! How does it feel to be recognized for your hard work?", "4747": "That sounds like a lot of dedication and hard work. Congratulations on your award, you must be really proud of yourself.", "4748": "That sounds like a great time! What kind of food are you planning on grilling?", "4749": "That sounds like a great way to relax and have some fun. What kind of food do you usually bring?", "4750": "That's great. Have a great time!", "4751": "It's understandable that you wanted to snack on something sweet. What can you do to make yourself feel better? Have you thought about taking a walk or doing something else to reward yourself for being so disciplined in your diet?", "4752": "That's great that you've been able to lose the weight. Have you tried any strategies to help you resist the cravings?", "4753": "I'm sorry to hear that. That must have been a special gift to you. Is there anything I can do to help?", "4754": "That's really unfortunate. It must have been a really special gift for you to be so upset about it. Is there anything I can do to help you feel better?", "4755": "That must have been a bit nerve-wracking! How did it go?", "4756": "That's good to hear. I'm glad she's being careful.", "4757": "I'm so sorry to hear that. That must have been a really difficult experience for you both. Is there anything I can do to help?", "4758": "That's completely unfair. Is there anything I can do to help?", "4759": "That's so sweet of her! It's amazing that she would go out of her way to make sure you were feeling better. Did it help?", "4760": "That's wonderful. It's so nice to have family that cares about you.", "4761": "Oh no! That sounds like it must have been really scary. Did you feel okay afterwards?", "4762": "That sounds really stressful. Is she okay now?", "4763": "That sounds really stressful. What happened?", "4764": "That's great! I'm sure she was relieved. It must have been hard to make it up to her.", "4765": "That sounds like it was a great experience. How did it feel to be back home?", "4766": "That sounds like a great visit! Did you have a chance to catch up with any of your old friends while you were there?", "4767": "That sounds like a great idea! Where are you thinking of buying them from?", "4768": "That's understandable. Skateboarding can be a rough sport, so it's nice to have some wheels that make the ride a bit smoother. Have you considered any other options?", "4769": "Oh, how did it go?", "4770": "That sounds like it was a bit of a disaster! How did your sister-in-law react?", "4771": "Oh no! How is she feeling now?", "4772": "That sounds like the perfect comfort food. I'm glad she's feeling better.", "4773": "That's so exciting! What are you most looking forward to?", "4774": "That sounds like a lot of fun. What are some of the activities you are looking forward to?", "4775": "That's great! How old is the kitten?", "4776": "That is so great that your friend has one. What is her name? Is she a playful one?", "4777": "That must have been really stressful. How did you cope with the anxiety?", "4778": "That's a bummer. Is there any way you can make room for your car in the garage? Maybe you can get creative with the storage space and make room for both cars?", "4779": "Wow, that sounds like he's really knowledgeable! It must have been really helpful to have someone like that to go to for help. How did it make you feel to have someone so knowledgeable to turn to?", "4780": "It's great that you have someone like that to turn to for advice. It must be really helpful to have a pro like that around.", "4781": "How did it go? Did you get the promotion?", "4782": "That's great! I'm sure you'll hear back soon. Have you done anything to prepare for the promotion?", "4783": "That's great! What charity have you chosen to support?", "4784": "That's so great! I'm sure they'll be very thankful for your support. Good luck on Sunday!", "4785": "That's so wonderful! It sounds like you really made her birthday special. How did you make the surprise happen?", "4786": "That sounds like an amazing experience! I'm glad you were able to make her dream come true.", "4787": "Wow, that sounds like a great time! What do you do when you go home?", "4788": "That sounds like a really special time for you. What is it that you enjoy the most when you go home?", "4789": "That must have been an exciting day for him! How did it go?", "4790": "That must have been so nerve-wracking! How did he do? Was he excited?", "4791": "Sounds like you've put in a lot of hard work. How are you feeling about it?", "4792": "That sounds like a lot of hard work!  Do you feel confident that you will do well on the test?", "4793": "That's great news! How did you feel about it?", "4794": "That's great! It sounds like you were really prepared for the interview. How did you feel about it overall?", "4795": "That sounds really nice. What was the movie about?", "4796": "It's nice to be able to look back and remember the good times. What was it about the movie that reminded you of your younger days?", "4797": "I'm so sorry to hear that. That must be really tough. Is there anything I can do to help?", "4798": "That's a great way to manage your emotions. Is there anything else you do to cope with the situation?", "4799": "That sounds really tough. How are you feeling about it?", "4800": "That sounds like a great companion. How long have you had him?", "4801": "That must be really frustrating. Is there anything I can do to help?", "4802": "That sounds really annoying. Have you tried talking to the development team again to see if they can help?", "4803": "That must be hard for you to see. Are you worried about them getting too much sugar or too many toys?", "4804": "That sounds like so much fun! Do you think you'll ever get the chance to visit her?", "4805": "I'm so sorry to hear that. That must have been really difficult for you. Is there anything I can do to help?", "4806": "I'm so sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to help?", "4807": "That sounds really disappointing. Is there anything you can do to recoup your losses?", "4808": "That's a smart decision. I'm glad you were able to keep your losses to a minimum.", "4809": "That sounds like it was really frustrating. Is there anything I can do to help?", "4810": "That's good to hear. Maybe it was just a one-time thing. Have you been able to clean it up?", "4811": "That's great! So what language did you learn?", "4812": "I understand that. It can be difficult to find the time to learn something new, but it sounds like you're making the most of it. Is there anything that has been particularly challenging for you?", "4813": "Wow, that's awesome! How does it feel to finally land an ollie after all this time?", "4814": "That's awesome! I'm so proud of you for sticking with it and finally achieving your goal. How does it feel?", "4815": "That sounds like a great way to spend your time off! Where are you going?", "4816": "That sounds like an amazing trip. I hope you have a great time!", "4817": "Sounds like the perfect way to relax and enjoy your vacation. Have a great time!", "4818": "Oh no! That must have been really frustrating. What did you do? ", "4819": "That sounds really frustrating. Did the airline reimburse you for the inconvenience?", "4820": "Wow, that's a really nice gift! What made her decide to get you something so special this year?", "4821": "That must have been a really nice surprise! What do you like most about it?", "4822": "That sounds like a nice time. How did it go?", "4823": "That sounds like it was really nice. What kind of life issues did you two talk about?", "4824": "That's great! Congratulations! How did it feel to get that raise?", "4825": "That's great to hear! What do you think made them decide to give you a raise?", "4826": "That sounds really stressful. Is there anything I can do to help?", "4827": "That sounds really difficult. Is there any way you can save money in other areas to help cover the cost of a new car?", "4828": "That's good to hear. Is there anything I can do to help you out? Maybe I can help you look for a second job or help you with the car repairs.", "4829": "That sounds like it must have been really special. What kind of memories did it bring up?", "4830": "That sounds like a lot of fun! It's nice to be able to look back and remember those moments.", "4831": "Oh no! What happened?", "4832": "I'm sorry to hear that. It's understandable that you were angry. Have you looked at any models yet? What kind of laptop are you looking for?", "4833": "Oh no! That must have been really frustrating! Did you have any idea it was a holiday?", "4834": "That's great that you got an extra day off! It's always nice to have a surprise day off.", "4835": "Sounds like you made the most of it! That's great.", "4836": "That's great to hear!

Are you excited to see him out there?", "4840": "That's great! I'm sure you have a very good chance of getting the job. When will you hear back from them?", "4841": "That's great! It sounds like you have a good chance of getting the job. Have you done any research on the company or position? That can help you prepare for the interview and make a good impression.", "4842": "That sounds great! What kind of job is it?", "4843": "That's great! I'm sure you'll do great in the interview. Best of luck!", "4844": "Oh no! That must have been so embarrassing for both of you. Is there anything I can do to help?", "4845": "That was really nice of the clerk. I'm glad your pup was able to feel better.", "4846": "That sounds like it was a bit nerve-wracking. How did it go?", "4847": "It can be tough to be on camera. Did they give you any feedback on how it went?", "4848": "No problem. Good luck!", "4849": "I'm so sorry to hear that. Have you talked to your doctor about other treatment options? It sounds like you're in a difficult situation and it's important to find a solution that works for you.", "4850": "That sounds really difficult. Have you looked into any other options like over-the-counter medications or natural remedies?", "4851": "That's great news! Congratulations!

It is wonderful that she is so creative and imaginative at such a young age. ", "4855": "That is great. It's wonderful to see a child's curiosity and creativity in action.", "4856": "That sounds like a lot of hard work! What did you like about the Sega Dreamcast?", "4857": "That's awesome! It's always nice to have something to look back on and remember the good times.", "4858": "Of course. What's going on? How can I help?", "4859": "Oh, no. That must have been really embarrassing. I'm so sorry you had to go through that. Is there anything I can do to help?", "4860": "No, it's not necessarily indicative of a deep-seated problem. It could just be a one-off thing. If it does happen again, though, it might be worth seeing a therapist to explore the possibility of underlying issues. But for now, try to stay positive and don't stress too much over it.", "4861": "Wow, that's really nice of your uncle. Have you tried it yet? What does it taste like?", "4862": "I'm glad it worked for you! It's great to have someone like your Uncle Jebodiah looking out for you. Have you talked to a doctor about it? It's always a good idea to get a professional opinion.", "4863": "Oh, no! That must have been so hard for you. How is your cat doing now?", "4864": "That's great to hear! I'm glad your cat is doing better.", "4865": "Oh no, that sounds like a really stressful situation. What happened?", "4866": "That must have been so stressful. Did you get the car fixed?", "4867": "I understand that you feel like you're being unfairly treated, and I can see why you would want to be able to walk on the moon. Is there a way that we can work together to find a solution that allows you to participate in the mission while also protecting your health?", "4868": "I'm sorry to hear that. Have you considered talking to your family or friends to see if they can help you come up with the money? Maybe they can help you find a way to raise the funds.", "4869": "That sounds like a lot of pressure. Is there anything I can do to help?", "4870": "It sounds like you're trying to be prepared for any situation. Is that what you're trying to do?", "4871": "Oh, my goodness. That's horrible!

Is there anything I can do to help?", "4874": "That's great that you were able to reschedule, but it must have been hard to apologize. How did it feel when you did?", "4875": "I understand why that can be confusing. It seems like the president's tweets are often out of the blue and can be hard to understand. Can you tell me more about what your friend said? ", "4876": "That is an interesting opinion. What do you think?", "4877": "That sounds like it must have been a really special moment! What was your favorite toy that you found?", "4878": "It sounds like you really enjoyed the experience. What was your favorite toy from the box?", "4879": "Oh, wow! What was that experience like?", "4880": "Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Did you get to do anything fun while you were there?", "4881": "That sounds like a really great experience.

What else do you plan on doing?", "4887": "That's really impressive! It's not easy to stay with the same company for such a long time. What made you so loyal?", "4888": "That's really tough. Are you looking for another job?", "4889": "What happened?", "4890": "I'm sorry to hear that. How did she react when you told her?", "4891": "That's great news! Congratulations! How do you feel about it?", "4892": "That's great to hear! What kind of job did you get?", "4893": "Oh no, that sounds really scary. Are you okay?", "4894": "That must have been so scary.

What made you decide to buy a ticket?", "4902": "That's awesome! It's great that you're supporting a good cause and you have a chance to win something too. Good luck!", "4903": "That's great! Who helped you?", "4904": "That's really kind of them to help out with your injury. Beer is a great way to show your appreciation for their help.", "4905": "That's too bad. It must be disappointing. Did you have any big plans for the money if you had won?", "4906": "That's too bad. It's always fun to dream about what you would do if you won the lottery. Have you ever won anything else?", "4907": "That sounds like a lot of fun! How did you like it?", "4908": "That's a valid concern. Have you thought about limiting the amount of time you spend playing?", "4909": "That's really frustrating. It's important to have secure elections, and it's disappointing that our politicians aren't doing more to protect them. Is there anything you can think of that might help? Maybe writing to your representatives or attending a rally?", "4910": "That's really frustrating. It's hard to understand why our politicians are so unwilling to take a stand against this kind of activity. Have you looked into any organizations or initiatives that are trying to fight Russian hacking?", "4911": "I'm so sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to help?", "4912": "That's a long time. It's understandable to be upset. Is there anything I can do to help you?", "4913": "That sounds really frustrating.

Is there anything I can do to help?", "4916": "I'm so sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to help?", "4917": "That must have been so disappointing. It's hard to watch something you had so much hope for slip away.", "4918": "I understand. That must have been really disappointing. Is there anything that you can do to help you feel better?", "4919": "Oh no, that doesn't sound very pleasant! Have you ever experienced this before?", "4920": "That's a good idea. If it's still bothering you tomorrow, it's probably best to get it checked out.", "4921": "Wow, that sounds like a lot of fun! How was it?", "4922": "That sounds like a great experience! What other tricks did he do?", "4923": "That's great! How did you hear about the job?", "4924": "That's fantastic! Are you feeling confident about the interview?", "4925": "That's great! What kind of test was it?", "4926": "That sounds like a great way to celebrate your accomplishment!", "4927": "That was really thoughtful of her. Does she do that often?", "4928": "That's so great to hear. It's amazing to have someone who cares so much about you.", "4929": "That must have been a big adjustment. How have you been handling it?", "4930": "That must be so hard. Do you still get to see them often?", "4931": "Wow, that's a lot of money. How did you manage to pay for it?", "4932": "That's so generous of her. It's nice to know that you have family who are willing to help out in times of need.", "4933": "That sounds like a lot of work. How did you feel after that?", "4934": "That sounds like a really nice moment. I'm glad you were able to take a few minutes to enjoy it.", "4935": "That must have been really hard on your family. How did you make it work?", "4936": "That sounds like such a relief. It must be so nice to have him around more. How do you two like it?", "4937": "That's really nice of them. How long did they let you use it for?", "4938": "That's really nice of them, it must have been a huge help for you.", "4939": "I'm sorry for your loss. That must have been a difficult sight.", "4940": "I'm so sorry for your loss. It's hard to lose someone you love.  Is there anything I can do to help?", "4941": "Oh no! That's terrible. Did you call the police?", "4942": "I'm so sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to help?", "4943": "That's amazing! I'm so proud of her! What's the story about?", "4944": "That is fantastic. Congratulations to your sister. I'm sure she is very proud of her accomplishment.", "4945": "Wow, that sounds amazing! What did they do?", "4946": "Wow, that's amazing! How long are you going for?", "4947": "That's great! How has it been going so far?", "4948": "Wow! That's so exciting! How many kittens did she have?", "4949": "That must have been so hard for you. Did you find someone to take care of them?", "4950": "That is great to hear. It's always reassuring to know that our pets are in safe and loving hands when we are away.", "4951": "That's great! How did it go?", "4952": "That's totally understandable. It can be really overwhelming for a pup to be around a bunch of other dogs for the first time! Did you try bringing him back a few times to get him used to it?", "4953": "That must have been really stressful for you. Is there anything I can do to help?", "4954": "That's really nice of you. I'm sure he appreciates it. It's easy to forget things once in a while, no need to be too hard on yourself.", "4955": "That's great! What made you decide to go back?", "4956": "That's wonderful to hear! What made you decide to take the plunge and go back to school?", "4957": "That's so special. What did you find in the box?", "4958": "That must have been really special. Did you find anything in particular that stood out to you?", "4959": "Wow, that's great! How long did it take them to finish?", "4960": "That's great that you didn't have to wait there. Was the service good?", "4961": "That sounds really difficult for him. Is there anything I can do to help him?", "4962": "I understand. It's hard when you can't do anything to help. Have you talked to him about it? Maybe talking it out will help him feel better.", "4963": "That's really nice of them! Do you have a long flight ahead of you?", "4964": "It's always nice to have friends who are willing to go out of their way to help you out.", "4965": "Wow, that's really shocking! What are you going to do now?", "4966": "I know, it's so disheartening. It's hard to know who you can trust these days. It's a shame that someone would do this, especially for such a long time.

How long were you together?", "4968": "It sounds like you had some great experiences in both. What was your favorite part of college?", "4969": "That must be really tough.

Maybe try to put your keys in a designated spot every time you come home, or get a keychain with a tracking device on it so you can always find them. Good luck!", "4973": "That must have been a surprise. Did you two talk or did you just leave them to their own devices?", "4974": "That's really nice that he's found someone he likes. I'm sure it's nice to have someone around he can connect with.", "4975": "That sounds really uncomfortable.

Is there anything I can do to help you?", "4990": "That's very admirable. It's not easy to be alone, but it can be a great opportunity to grow and learn more about yourself. Is there anything I can do to help you with this transition?", "4991": "That sounds intimidating! What makes you feel unqualified for the job?", "4992": "That's understandable. Have you tried any relaxation techniques before the interview? Deep breathing, positive affirmations, or a mindfulness practice can help to reduce anxiety.", "4993": "That's understandable. Moving to a new place can be a stressful experience. Is there anything in particular that's making you anxious?", "4994": "That sounds like a great move. Is there anything in particular that's making you nervous?", "4995": "Oh no, that's terrible. Are you okay?", "4996": "I'm so sorry you had to witness that. That must have been really tough.

What happened then?", "5026": "I'm so sorry to hear that. That must be really hard for you. Is there anything I can do to help?", "5027": "It sounds like you're still struggling to come to terms with the breakup. It's natural to feel a bit of jealousy or envy when your ex starts seeing someone else, so don't be too hard on yourself. It might help to focus on the positive aspects of being single and the things you can do to move on from the relationship.", "5028": "It's understandable that you still have some mixed feelings.
