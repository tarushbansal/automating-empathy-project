If you love the outdoors, there is a lot to do there!", "No, i havent, but wish i did.", "I haven't checked recently to see if they are. Do you have a favorite band or musician?", "I'm one of those people who have a hard time narrowing down to a favorite. So i enjoyed several of them. Do you like football?", "I do! i prefer to watch it live, but if it's on TV, I only watch big games like the Superbowl.", "Do you have a favorite team? Or any team as long as it's football.", "I watch Alabama games, but I also like the Greenbay Packers. ", "Nice! i became a fan when a friend's brother played with them.

I can help you if you want.", "Ask people around if anyone has seen anything suspicious?", "Try looking for clues in the area.", "Great idea. And if it does not work, just call the police.", "Why though? Police is there to help us.", "Reading and playing video games mostly. What about you?", "It makes me feel younger looking than my family members, like my mean sister-in-law who doesn't like me.", "Yes, that's a valid perspective. I don't really need an escape because I have never had to work a day in my life.", "If I had to, I would! Working since age 16 sounds like a LOT. Maybe this is why my sister-in-law doesn't like me, because I don't work?", "I never want to be dependent on anyone - ever! It would be like prison.", "Fortunately, my great great great great grandmother left money that has supported all of us.", "I actually envy you. Maybe I can try my hand at this working thing, and it will take my mind off my sister-in-law.", "It is just an expensive lesson. No failure is final I am sure you tried.", " Three and 7 grandchildren. I can empathise when things do not go as you expected.", "Every stage has challenges but we have enjoyed them all.

I adopted her as a senior dog.", "I just failed at fostering a deaf and partially blind Aussie.  He's my boy now!", "Thank you!  I needed him as much as he needed me, I think.", "I usually go hiking alone. I just like to see nature, see all the trees.", "Oh, definitely. Though if you'", "Yeah. It's really inspiring. I'd like to try to paint or draw it sometime but I don't think I'd do it justice.", "I sometimes try to paint along with that Joy of Painting show but I'm not as good as I'd like.", "I'm in accounting. It's kind of intense sometimes so I look for fun ways to de-stress on weekends.", "Hence the hiking and watching art shows. Bob Ross is super calming, ever watch him paint?", "He's been a favorite of mine since I was a kid.", "You should. I've been a few times and it's very impressive.", "I would love to go someday.

Pretty silly stuff.", "i think any time away is a plus, no matter how far or close.  ", "Not recently.

South of Dubai, if you're familiar with that.", "I love swimming so the beach would've been great!", "Good for you.  You don't need to be around people like that.  You'd probably have more fun without them.", "What will you be studying at the academy?", "Oh wow....that sounds amazing.  The only interest I seem to have is online shopping.  LOL", "Yes, that makes sense.  I'm excited for you.", "You will be great at it, I'm sure.  Are other friends not as excited?", "You should try it, it's a lot of fun. Quake improved on Doom by offering full real-time #D rendering and even had early support for 3D acceleration.", "No, I don't listen to too much music. I watch TV. I like Supernatural.", "True that. I went to my fave sushi place last night and wore my red dress with red lipstick. ", "Yes - and my convoluted point is that sushi is easy to eat on a date! I only order the veggie rolls. ", "That is funny! Do you like Indian food? ", "Yummy! Now, I am getting hungry. What are you having for dinner?", "I think I may have some Chex cereal. I feel best when I don't eat gluten, though I slip all the time.", "What does that mean? :) Head on a swivel? Good one! ", "Yeah, it's all good. I like it on just about anything. Have you ever tried the donuts with bacon?", "I have! It's sweet and salty and the one I had was caramel, so it was smoky and just delicious.", "Oh, I wish I could eat out more! ", "There's a local diner here where I live called HomeTown. They have the best onion rings. What's yours?", "Ohhhh, I love barbecue. I used to do the KCBS BBQ competitions!", "You are going to love it!  It's a place for happy people (I am a happy person myself!)", "Not at the moment because I can't use it very well.", "Yes. I have one installed but I think I will practice and take some lessons too.", "That sounds like a good idea. I should keep that in mind for when I have my own children.", "No. Not right now, I don't feel ready, want to get more education.", "Absolutely. And I would think it costs a lot to feed and clothe them. Does it cost a lot?", "Especially if they intend to go to college? Education is expensive and hard work.", "Then, I wouldn't feel bad about it. Are you a vegetarian? I am.", "I love Italian, Indian, American - You name it. But I have to limit my carbs.

", "I love apple pie also", "That would be great", "That is awesome I wish I had more time to bake", "Yeah it can be hard to find time to sit and eat with family", "Some times I find I eat while writing or playing video games.", "Oh no did it not go well?", "Public Transportation, I have. But nothing like a transcontinental passenger train", "Agreed, that would be badass. Have you ever traveled anywhere by train?", "That sounds like a heck of a trip! How long was the ride?", "How neat! Did they give you the whole ride or did you have to switch off?", "Very nice! I always though railways are a very safe land transport system. Would you agree?", "I'm glad you agree! Where are you from?", "Well, because I work from home, designing video games, I need family contact. :)", "Also, my Mom is my best friend, so that makes it easy. Do you have a favorite video game?", "Oh, I started with Donkey Kong! What did you do today?", "Oh, that sounds divine! Today, I worked, and now, I may make some chicken tikka. :)", "You are after my heart! I LOVE CHICKEN KORMA. I am American!", "Just copied that down. :) Thanks! Should I buy an Instant Pot? That sounds easy!", "Losing a job can be devastating. How is he handling it?", "I'm glad he's taking it well. Yes. I got really depressed, but I found that getting outdoors was really helpful.

Got a favourite song by them?", "That is a hard thing to go through. If I could turn back time, I would never have accepted my last job.", "Well, my manager was very controlling, and I have a tough time with that - being controlled. How about you?", "Are you employed?", "This sounds so hard for you. Does your husband have any good prospects? ", "No, I am single - almost married three times, though. I think my control issues run deep!", "If I meet the right man, definitely. However, I am at an age where most of the men are carrying heavy baggage.

I like classical music too.", "That's great, you are going to love it and I hope you get there.  What else is on the bucket list?", "For now I'm good, off the bucket list.  Mountain climbing is worthwhile, but expensive, and after a summit need to recover.", "Driving IS frustrating.  I walk a lot, allows for my mind to think.

Did it sound like a person?", "That is certainly understandable. Do you have any pets? My dog is always a source of entertainment like that", "Wow, that's a lot of pets. Do they all get along with each other. My dog is definitely a loner pet and is best with only people.", "My dog also acts as a protector when I am out on walks with him. I would love to own a cat one day, but I'm allergic to them", "I seem to have an affinity with them though. Whenever I go over to a friend's house they get all over me.", "That sounds great.
