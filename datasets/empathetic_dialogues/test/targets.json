How long will you be staying?", "Yes I agree, she was so happy when she found out the job was hers", "She wasn't really fired, her position was no more.

What kind of puppy did you get?", "Thats a nice breed of dog.  I just went on a camping trip with a relative who has one, they are very loyal and smart of course.  Was he/she your first pet?", "that's good! you should be proud of yourself", "that's great! i hate when people cheat", "I can only imagine having to wait at the table alone, wondering if she'd show up. At least, it sounds like, she finally arrived.  Did she specify a reason for being so late?", "That's good. I can somewhat relate. I think the longest I've waited on someone was a colleague who was supposed to meet us at happy hour, and ended up getting delayed by our boss for 45 minutes. We were glad she made it out, but I did feel worse for her than for all of us.", "Ahhh! Me too, there is so much that can be done on the weekends!", "I understand that! I have a bunch of pet snakes that wake me up thru the night!", "Actually that has happened to me, during Thanksgiving", "Im from NC mountains, it can be tricking driving when the snow is latying fast", "That is a smart idea.

My son was terrified of tornadoes because of that darn movie, and we don't really even get tornadoes where we live! Did you ever live through a tornado?", "Aw, poor little thing! How did you overcome this? Or, are you still afraid of them?", "Your mom sounds awesome!  Wow, what a cool thing to say!  ", "Yes! THAT I feel good about! Making a point to use it as an opportunity to talk. I've definitely used it when it comes to the way others might act -- emphasizing that it's not about *them*, it's really about the person and where they're at.", "I do look at that as a strength, in anyone.

It stresses you out when you don't need it to.", "Yeah, everyone just seems miserable, so it kind of drags you down, too. But it's a necessary evil.", "that is why I am scared to have kids, that sounds terrible", "that seems to be the case, you win some you lose some I guess", "Who would that be?", "I love seeing mine too. I know how happy that must make you feel. Mine are local.", "thats good to hear.  my kids will returning to school soon as well.  I cant wait!", "thats cool", "Every little accomplishment counts!

Did you pass your exam?", "yay! congrats! that's really awesome. you should be proud of yourself", "That's really exciting! I would be so happy about that. ", "That's what I would do too. Do you have something in mind? ", "Forget him. Get yourself a real man.", "If he really loved you, he would pay attention to your every need. Kick him to the curb.", "Be positive. Don't deviate your mind while driving. Concentrate completely on driving. You can.", "Sorry to hear this. Hope you'll get out from this fear and become a good driver.

Whats going on?", "I work from home too.  Its so nice to be able to do laundry and things on my breaks.  Im so productive around the house", "and I can stay in my PJs all day long!", "Yeah, of course I can! That sounds heartless. Maybe that shows you who your friends truly are, and you should maybe look elsewhere... Could be a wake-up call.", "Oh, I misunderstood! I thought you meant you weren't invited to one that you later found out about. Hah! Then I guess the wake-up call is you have really good friends! So, you like surprise parties then? I never did.", "Owed money to my mother in law for something, $15, she reminded me in a less then nice way.", "Exactly, especially since she owes me a lot more of something being paid over time.", "I have been there many times.", "I love going to the Spurs games.", "Wow that is a long time ago.", "Yes, where did you go to college?", "That is so disgusting.

Thank you", "Why Thank you!", "THanks for being so understanding!  I feel a little better now.", "I did! The company does something that I actually like -- a panel interview vs a series of one-on-ones. Have you ever had an interview like that?", "It just means you're in a room with several representatives from different parts of the company. To me, that helps it feel more like a conversation -- and it's more time efficient too!", "There are some bad parents out there, that's for sure. Is it hard to be a parent?", "Lol, that is terrible. She should have changed his diaper before leaving the house what the heck...", "That sucks. Maybe it's time to get new friends?", "Don't worry, it will get better.

Happily, it hasn't affected my ability to trust -- just inspired me to be more truthful with myself and others ;-)", "I love reuniting with old friends, helps me remember and appreciate the good times.", "I bet that was a long time ago!", "I was very excited with my result.

Either one is a little sad to be honest.", "It's like losing a family member :(", "What happened to him? Are you guys roommates?", "That is very bad. Unemployed individual can be very frustrating to deal with", "How did they lose so much weight compared to you?", "Maybe it has something to do with your diet ?", "Getting out of town and way from all of everday life's struggles always sounds like a great time.  Did you leave you cell phone at home while you weer away to 'really' get away from everything for a minute?", "That sounds like a really relaxing time, I'm jealous.", "No refunds for a cancel 1 week before? That sounds like a total scam! I would be furious. Did you ever find a way to get your money back? Because that does not sound legal!", "I hope that you win your money back and then some, you really deserve it after all of that upset!", "Lovely.  What did you do together?", "Sounds like a great time.  What has brought that memory back up again>", "That must feel lonely.  You should go out and try to meet some people!", "Good deal!  Hopefully then you won't feel so alone!", "That is frightening! especially if you didn't know whether it was a harmful spider or not! What did you do?", "Oh, so you were able to get that spider away from you! Good job, hopefully that won't have to happen to you again!", "Summer is not over until Labor Day! We still have the whole month of August!!", "Summer can be over in July for teachers sometimes.

I really hope he doesn't win in 2020.", "He's like an angry child trying to make everything about himself!", "Dang, that sucks. MAybe they can visit you instead?", "Ah, gotcha. Well I hope you heal fast!", "I guess you don't live in Alabama? Was it overall a good trip....or challenging? Or both!", "Well, if the drive was the most challenging it sounds like a good trip! Too often it's family dynamics that are *more* challenging -- and not so easily taken care of. ;-)", "That is the worst!! I know that you must have been very frustrated with your teammate.", "There have been a number of times where this has happened to me too. I hope that doesn't happen to you too much in the future!! :)", "I hate bees and wasps so much.

We had a fine time, but I sure am wondering about my friendship!", "Could be. I just feel he was being rather inconsiderate, which is not something I'd expect of him.", "Kind of what I was thinking. I won't be arranging to meet him again for a while, that's for sure!", "I bet. How much did she win and did she offer to share?!", "That's a lot of money, to me anyway. Perhaps she's got a lot of debt to pay off, or perhaps she has kids to take care of?", "Good job! You must have worked hard and prepared. Or are you just naturally really smart?", "Well done! You should be proud.", "If I'm understanding you correctly, they're going to clean it up, right?", "Wow, that's fantastic news indeed! How long has it been derelict?", "Well, I'm in a wheelchair, so can't move too quickly. I just sat looking at them, trying to figure out whether I could reach the broom at the corner of the porch.", "Well, that would have been an option. The person came right up to my porch and said \"Good morning. Can't sleep either?\" It was my friend and neighbor walking her dog and I didn't recognize her with all her winter gear on. Scared the daylights out of me!", "That's sweet. I'm sure she will adjust in time. Have you ever personally had to make a move like your daughter did?", "No, I never have.

Soon you'll have enough money to buy a new house.", "Exactly, it feels great when your prepared for the unexpected.", "That's fun.

They have some really cool Roller coasters.  I hope you have a great time.", "Ive been to the one in Tampa.  They have this new coaster that rotates forward and backward and spins around.

The entire roof will definitely have to be replaced.", "Yes, insurance will cover it thankfully. I am very lucky.", "Wow, you remember your friends from grade school? Maybe if I saw them again those memories would come back.", "Well, I hope you had a really great time. It sounds like you probably did!", "That sounds like fun, do you have a big family?", "Yes I understand, I have a big family so it's hard for us to all get together at the same time.", "Ive never been to one of those.  Is she really young or is she like a professional dancer?", "thats awesome.  I wish I would have taken dancing lessons when I was younger.  Im a horrible dancer", "yea you're right.  Maybe ill look into some classes and give it a shot", "Aw, that's so nice of him! Does he live far away?", "That's a great son. It's always nice to be able to rely on people close to you to help out when needed", "Yeah I have had that experience. One was so bad I left before getting another job. Don't recommend doing that, lol.", "Stick it out until you have a backup. Your bank account will thank you!", "Yes, it went straight to the outside trash container. I was very surprised that my entire refrigerator didn't smell bad.", "Thanks for that information. I'll try it out.", "That sounds wonderful! What type of store is it?", "I love that! It must be so much fun to curate the types of things that go in to the store. Do you help out or work there?", "I'm sure she *loves* having both your presence and your support!", "Wow, I can't imagine how you felt living in Hong Kong. That would take some serious adapting.", "I am so happy that you found that expat community. I have often thought about moving abroad, and I'm glad that you adapted well.", "I think I might. It sound exciting, and I thank you for the encouragement.", "That's unfortunate, but I'm happy that you have a good support network to help you out.", "I hope you recover well and I'm sure you will with good support by your side.", "We're living with it. And it's dividing us as a society. I truly hope that the upcoming months will bring big change. Definitely working for that!", "Me too! <fist bump> ;-)", "Wow, that's a good amount of time. Is he usually so secretive?", "Ah, maybe he just wanted to make sure it was going to work before he told anyone. ", "It should be harder to get a license than it is.", "It's as if some people think they are the only one's on the road.", "She passed two days after Christmas. She was very sick during the whole month of December.", "I will, and thank you so much for the encouragement.", "Please don't ever give up. I would definitely work harder to find a job by networking with friends that have jobs in different places.", "Go ahead and post your resume on as many job related forums that you can. I think it's great that you're trying to find other ways of making money too. You are a go-getter, and don't ever give up!!", "That is awesome. Do you know what she wants to study?", "As long as it is something she enjoys. I am sure you are very proud of her!", "it has been really busy even for me at work , i feel your pain", "I know right ? unfortunately for us those are the perks of growing up lol", "Oh I don't think I could do that. I have a fear of falling from high places. ", "I think I would pass out from fear lol.", "I think the chances I take should be directly proportionate to the consequences of the actions.", "That is interesting. Do you miss meat or dairy at all?", "That is good to hear. I wish you the best of luck with your new diet.", "oh man that sounds like serious stuff ,and it sounds really scary as well hope everything goes great", "That's terrible to hear. Were you eventually able to be there?", "That's great news. I don't know what I would do if my mom passed.", "Me too. I'm glad everytihng worked out in the end for you.", "Not very often. She lives about 7 hours away driving time.", "It was blue with white racing stripes. ", "Same here, they are pretty expensive.

What is your favorite meal?", "Me too, do you have a favorite flavor?", "when that happened to me i watched a lot of movies , for some reason the sad movies made me cry, but just be strong and patient one day you realize you can do better or find someone new", "it happens to the best of us, and i totally understand where your coming from , spend some time with your friends or loved ones ", "What did he cook that is such an exciting way to spend your day with your papa.", "That sounds so delicious I would have loved a plate of that food any deserts ", "Thank you, I am so excited. It has taken 3 years of hard work to earn this promotion.", "I work in the military ", "That is so exciting! Such a fun time in life to watch them discover new things and always be such a surprise with what you didn't know that they already knew! ha ha, that's a tongue twister.", "I do!  An 8 year old daughter and 5 year old son.  They are my life as well so I totally get what you're saying.  How old is your daughter?", "Where are you going", "Oh wow, I hope you have fun", "Happy Birthday!!!!  Did you have a nice time?", "I love sushi.  Did you get a spicy Tuna Roll?", "Sounds good.  You have some generous parents.", "Very nice, wind in your hair, exercise, and fresh air.  Did you have a good time?", "I am actually home bound, but I love to live through other peoples experiences.  My wife and kids go out and bring back stories of their adventures.  I love it!", "I know how you feel.  I moved away from my family and friends this summer.  Do you have family nearby at all? I often feel lonely when I'm watching a movie by myself but then I remind myself that I'm loved by a lot of people.", "You are so strong!  Please thank your husband for his service and thank you for being his support, no matter the miles between you.  Take care of yourself and get out with friends when you can!", "Ah -- thank you! Definitely aware of wanting to live life to its fullest. We've recently gone through a tough time, so it feels lovely to focus on adventure again.", "Bless you! What a *relief* and how impressive!

Did she take it well?", "That's really awesome that you supported your friend!", "I'm sure he really appreciated you support too!", "Aw, I'm sorry. I know this isn't the best solution, but have you considered listening to funny podcasts?", "No problem! I know you can't always fix everything, but it's worth trying wierd ideas every now and then", "Oh wow, I love that kind of sauce", "That isnt long at all", "It is always good to keep our skills up to date. We never know. It could also help for a promotion also.", "I hope you get your promotion.", "Oh man, your life is about to get so much more hectic. I feel for you. When my first was born, I was just as pumped, full of naivety and positivity. I felt like I could take on anything coming my way. I was exhausted after two weeks. It's such a long ride until they're able to even remotely look after themselves.", "I know you have a lot of work ahead of you, but I'm sure it will be a rewarding feeling that will be unmatched for the rest of your life. As a man, I can't imagine what you'll have to go through, or what you will enjoy, but I really commend all women everywhere for the strength they give when having a child.", "Did it scare you?", "Yes, a little bit. When I was young, I didn't like that much scary movies.", "Whats your favorite team?", "Well for me, in the NFL I like the Cowboys and college its Alabama too.", "That's pretty cool.

I hope the repair didn't cost you too much! ", "Ah I see. Something similar happened to my brother too recently while he was picking me up, so we were stuck at a coffee shop parking lot for several hours. ", "Well at least you put in the effort. What grade did you end up receiving on this test?", "That's great! Hard work pays off I guess.", "Oh I'm sorry.  How are his family doing?", "It's pretty hard to deal with.  One of my friend's buddies died in a car crash as well.", "Woah, that is huge news. How are you handling the news.", "I am happy to hear that you will be ok. Enjoy having no kids while you can!", "That does not sound fun. What did you do to prepare. ", "That is very smart thinking!", "How old were you? If you were a kid, that deserves a pass!", "You live and you learn, at least it was a petty crime and nothing serious!", "That's sweet of you, the flu is a pretty gnarly sickness to go through. You sound like a good friend!", "That's good, at least he is getting better, he'll survive!", "There's nothing wrong with that", "You should celebrate too. I would", "That is always disappointing. Did you have a good time with your friends anyway?", "Sounds like you guys know how to have fun no matter what. You have good friends. ", "I too feel the same. What did happen at last?", "Yeah, very good to hear! congrats!", "Eww, I hate neighbors that have no class.", "Maybe you should start a petition in the neighborhood to kick her out.", "How awful!

I wish I could see a pic of it!", "Oh he will be, but enjoy it, only babies once", "that's a pretty long date! Where did you guys go?", "That sounds like a fun day! My wife and i used to go to movies a lot!", "That's terrible.  Was he already very sick?", "Im sorry he went through that.", "Those were the days right. I loved those paychecks no bills.... can we go back to that? ", "Yeah and I bet it was like a whole 100 or 200 bucks and we were probably feeling like a ceo. ", "How does that make you feel? Is that a dealbreaker", "Ah, I guess you have to save money somewhere", "Oh no I am sorry to hear about that, were you together long?", "That's good make yourself available and open for others and you will find the next relationship", "That is embarassing, but a good story at least!", "That is for sure, you can always count on parents for that", "IT does go fast. I was just changing my daughters diaper and now she is in junior high!", "I miss being called mommy. One day you'll be called grandma", "that is embarassing, but were you at least okay?", "Well maybe they found that endearing in a way!", "maybe like 19, but i felt bad after so i invited them to dinner", "Yeah i told them as well", "i'm sorry to hear that. i know exactly what you are going through. My brother tragically passed away 2.5 years ago. He was only 32", "I know how hard it was for you. My parents and my brother lived in a different country so i couldn't even go there at that time to be with them.

Guess I know better for next time.", "that is awesome. sundays are usually my veg out days.", "mine is going crazy with mosquitos", "i tried to trim my tomato leaves yesterday but i got bit up so bad i ran back inside", "What does your husband do for work?", "My uncle use to be an iron worker, so I know exactly what you are talking about.", "That is VERY understandable. Emotional affair is still a betrayal. ", "Well it's nice he is kind but yes that is a little strange. Women can usually take that as something and try to get with your man. ", "Art, she was accepted into a special program for high school.", "Mostly drawing. And she's in advanced level classes in most subjects.", "That is terrible.  I don't know why teenage boys can be so mean.  What did you end up doing?", "That's good that she has a big brother that can defend her against the bigger kids.  It is just terrible that a teenage boy would act that way to a 10 year old.  No excuse for that.  I hope you don't have to deal with it again, though.", "Retail, but he's working nights at a store really far away and it sucks", "We are hoping with in a few months.", "Hey that's awesome!!!  What are you planning to buy with it?", "That's an awesome, very adult thing to do!  Congrats!", "I don't like them either. It makes me sick.", "Oh my gosh!

It's difficult waiting, and not knowing!", "He is a welder and iron worker, so he works very hard all year long and does extensive amounts of travel. He has earned it!", "that is no good! you need someone to be there and take care of you.", "I have never been married, so i cant imagine,  but I would want to be with my spouse every moment of every day.", "It is so hard and so rewarding to see them grow up. ", "I bet.  I really want to hold on to mine forever, but I know that they need to grow up.  I hope you are still able to make memories with yours even as they are getting older.", "That is pretty scary. Did you find out where it came from?", "Smart move. You don't want to get involved in a gunfight. Glad you made it out safely.", "So sorry to hear that.. May i ask how did it happen?", "How sad.. Feel better knowing that he is in a better place now buddy", "Wow. Congratulations! Is your new job near home?", "Oh, that's awful. What did you do?

I bet you cant wait to move in.", "Really?", "So sorry about that", "I know how you feel. I'm working right now :(", "Can you blame her?   I mean, if i didn't have bills that's what I'd be doing.", "Isn't that the best!  My 3 year old the same thing!  I couldn't be happier or more proud!", "She may be a natural artist!", "I see.. did they complete them?", "Well, we were kids once too.. We can understand their point of view as well. Glad you got to spend quality time with them though", "Thats really cool! i hope you get one very soon buddy", "Yeah, i can understand how that can be frustrating. Dont worry, things will fall in its place soon enough", "awh memories, what were they of? ", "so cute, i love those memories i bet it was beautiful.

I hope you find someone very soon..", "I can understand that. I don't get nearly as many birthday wishes as I used to. I guess it happens as we get older.", "I agree. I think they think we don't care about our birthday so they don't care either. But they are wrong.", "Oh! I am so happy for you. Congratulations. What was the job?", "That sounds very interesting. I'm sure you will do great. ", "What happened??", "Holy moly! That would have scared me too! Did you kill it?", "That is understandable.  Such an experience can be tramatic.  Did you eventually learn?", "My wife had a similar experience, she still doesn't drive.  Good for you for overcoming it.", "That sounds miserable!  Did you do it yourself?", "At least you saved money doing it yourself!", "Oh wow! that stinks. Im sorry", "I bet it was. At least its over now ", "I bet.  I was the same way.  How did you guys meet?", "Nice.  That's a relatively unique way to meet.  What store?", "I would be furious.  What did you do?", "What was the outcome?  Did the professor believe you?", "That's awesome!  What kind of house is it?", "That's gonna be a lot of fun, but a lot of work.

Be prepared to kick it's butt and get good grades!", "Always put your school first, you will be thankful you did later!", "Whoa that's exciting!  What kind of car we looking at?", "That's a really good/safe first car.", "Thats awesome!  What kind of car do you want", "Well I really hope you are able to save up and get it soon!", "That's annoying, I hate how little attention most other drivers pay on the road.", "I'm glad that you are okay!

Gotta love dads and step dads!", "Oh that sounds disgusting! ", "I hope he gets that taken care of!", "It's awful. I really wish far more resources were put toward mental health facilities and counselling in this country!", "Most definitely. We actually need these resources to get mentally disturbed people off the streets and get them the help they deserve.", "There's so much we could be doing to help those in need and yet our politicians (on both sides!) are off helping the rich and corporations - it's disgusting.", "Oh no. I'm so sorry. Can you video chat with her?", "How wonderful. That's what's important and makes life meaningful in my opinion.", "Wow! That is insane, too bad you didn't bet with those kind of odds.", "That sounds like a great time, one of those nights you always remember!", "That's true.  I was a little startled b/c I don't remember changing classes for things until 7th grade.  Just a reminder that kids grow up so much faster now.", "That's true - when I was in kindergarten, we only went for half the day.", "It feels good to get everything together, doesn't it?

We have our own traditions now, but the good old days will always remain just that!", "It's funny, we always remember the successful, fun times and forget about the not-so-perfect things. Must be our minds' defense kicking in! ", "I know that when just the 4 people in my family do go out, it runs us about $65.  So we do it very rarely, it wastes a lot of money.", "A week!?

I've been watching him play for a while now and it's such a fantastic feeling to see him win - and in his own country too!", "Thank you - he'd appreciate it.

It is an amazing sport.", "There is Skydive Orange and Virginia Skydiving Center.  I grew up near Richmond!", "Nothing wrong with that. I'm definitely with you on the organizational front.

She wore a hat for almost a month when she left the house.", "Well, like I told her, it will grow out, it will just take time.", "That doesn't sound good.

What was wrong with her, if you don't mind my asking?", "Well, I'm really glad to hear she's recovered. Stomach bugs are awful - they really take their toll on you.", "Why was it boring, nothing exciting to do where you live?", "Ah yeah, that sucks. No time for anything fun.", "What kind of operation is it? I'm unfamiliar with weight loss surgery.

I still feel pretty introverted, but since coming to college, I've been forced to socialize more, and it's help me at least \"fake it until I make it.\" I still prefer to be alone a lot of the time, but at least I can somewhat manage without making myself look dumb. Maybe you can just think of some topics/things to talk about to have in the back of your head for the times when things get quiet?", "I hope it goes well! If it makes you feel any better, most of them are probably just as nervous and are looking for any excuse to relax and let their guard down, too. Good luck", "Not that particular one, no.

One that actually died and one that was miraculously saved.  It was a dark and tough time.  Did that happen to you recently?", "I am soo soo very sorry.

Just gotta pass those exams!", "Aw, that's awesome, did it bring back memories?", "Yeah, it's always nice to take a look back and reflect on the early days.", "Nice! Who did you go see?

I really didn't expect him to say that - we don't know each other that well.", "Very true. I do pet his dog when I see them. Perhaps he recognizes a fellow dog-lover!", "That doesn't seem fair.

What kind of things do you do?", "aw man that sucks how come he gets to get one but not you", "well after a certain age parent's start to treat children differently lol", "when does she return?", "well thats good", "Did you go running like crazy!?

I'd never have the guts to do it so kudos to you.", "That kind of stinks. Sorry to hear that! Well, at least there are worst things to forget outside.. Maybe this is an easy learning lesson!", "I didn't even think of that! That's one thing about tea with me, that I've never gotten into it because you get it and it's so hot, so you have to wait forever to drink it. You set it down and then ultimately forget it!", "Nervous. Surgery is a big step and I'm afraid something will go wrong.", "You're absolutely correct and the hospital's one of the best in the country. Still, I fret about it.

I was humiliated,lol.", "I am so sorry to hear that. Was she able to go surrounded by you guys?", "It's hard to lose a family member like that. You guys should take some time to grieve.", "Where did they go?", "That sounds like so much fun!", "Stomp around at all times of the day and night, screeching into their cellphones and playing loud video games. What do yours do?", "Eww. Yes, it is loud. Who would live in an upstairs apartment with a small child? That's nuts!", "Oh wow, I bet you can't wait! I remember when I had to spend a summer overseas and it was awful to be away from my husband.", "Well, she'll be back soon and you'll have loads of catching up to do.

Odd how being alone can make you paranoid.", "I would go mad, were you away at college or in the service?", "That is great, I am sure he misses you and will be so happy to see you. He will smell you coming and know your there even before you get in the door.", "I hope so should be home really soon.  Can't wait to hear all about it.  IT goes by to fast!", "I know my oldest just graduated,  It was like it was over in an instant!", "Did it turn out how you expected it", "I'm glad to hear... Weddings can be stressful", "Maybe put the poop back on your neighbors yard?", "Its the only way to get them to learn", "Yes it is and he is so devoted to God and living for Him.

I cleaned it up pretty quickly.", "Oh yeah? Did you go give it a try?", "That's a shame. I hate it when a place doesn't live up to the hype.", "If things got a bit much I'd excuse myself and go elsewhere.

I hope you are feeling better about it now.", "I bet. Losing a pet is much like losing a loved one. It gets better but still hurts sometime.", "Yeah, and it's one he really wanted and enjoys. I'm really happy for him, but would have really liked to see him.", "I hope so. We always have such a good time and like a lot of the same things. Oh well, some other time.", "Yes, it hit our whole family very hard. That was in 2013, and sometimes I still pick up the phone to call her and tell her something.", "Thank you.", "That must have been a little bit of a roller coaster. That's kind of why I'm not wild about cats, is because they're so independent, and the outside cats can just go hang out somewhere for days and not have a care in the world about you. But I guess that suits some people.", "Oh man.. so that was REALLY a roller coaster then. I'm so sorry.. I hope you're not overwhelming yourself with guilt about it. It sounds like something you could not have any control over.", "It sure is! Good on your nephew - it's a great sport. And good for you, too. It's all too easy just to sit back. I have to force myself to do physical therapy so I can walk again!", "Just the thought of getting back on the golf course is enough to get me off the couch, lol.", "I did not for many years, but my brother convinced me to tandem with him to celebrate our mothers remission.", "I think when my children are grown that I might, I would need to feel secure with the abilities of those in charge. You are putting your life in their hands.", "I am, I have been watching all my favorite movies. ", "I am, I think my wife is getting tired of all the time I am spending watching movies. ", "That sounds horrible. I would not have been able to sleep after that.", "How terrifying. I hope you were able to find and kill it.", "Well, it's okay to be a bit nervous. Interviewers will understand that. You only have to halfway reign in it in and you'll hit that happy medium that's good for a workplace interview. Where are you applying to?", "I bet you have a good shot at it! Good luck", "I told my husband. The dream made me miss my best friend from high school.", "I actually sent her a message through facebook.", "I guess that's a good word for it. ", "Yeah, he is such a cutie. I have been playing with my new pup the rest of the day. ", "It is, a day I will always remember. I named him spot, because he has a funny looking spot on his back. ", "I may buy it still, but I have to save up more money now.", "I hope so. I as so exited to be able to get it.", "It was sheer greed, I'm afraid. I know everyone has their moments, but I really shouldn't have done that.", "It certainly was - German chocolate is delicious!", "Oh no, poor baby", "Yes cuddles will help", "That sounds really fun. Can you still remember some of the routines?", "Yea that is a long time. You should reach out to some and see if they are on social media.", "I've been around the game all my life and just love both playing and watching. I'd imagine that, if you don't play, it would be pretty boring!", "I think it's the format of this tournament that gets me addicted. It's not like regular tournaments, in that teams are playing against each other.", "Yes, I was able to make her feel better, and her daddy made her laugh. But my mama bear side came out, and I was ready to confront some people.", "Yes, they did.", "Oh my god! what did you do? did you tell anyone?", "LOLOLOL the cops probably had a good laugh about that.", "They're filthy, ignorant bullies. I would sentence them to life in prison, without parole!!!", "More laws need to be passed so they can be prosecuted. So many states have nothing on the statute books.", "It ended up just being a raccoon rummaging through our trash. But at the time we thought it was someone trying to break in. ", "It would be, I worry for the safety of my family. ", "They can, but he was in a real bind and I was able to do so. I know he's grateful for the loan, so I reckon I'll be ok there.", "Even part would be ok. He needs to get a bunch of savings together so he doesn't find himself in that situation again.", "I bet that was scary. Did he surprise you with something?", "Ahhh. How nice. You are lucky to have such a thoughtful husband. ", "Does it look like a space ship?", "I have never seen a drone flying around here. Even in the day time", "What does she do?", "Wow, I would just tell her its private. Sounds annoying", "Over the summer, he started acting strange so we took him in for testing.", "A border collie, he was a great doggie.", "Oh no, have you been able to calm yourself down?", "I can understand that, I think I would be a mess too.", "That does not sound plpeasant at all, maybe they should relocate those who are staying there.", "Hopefully no one was injured at all from the accident?", "I did, two days after packing it we had a blizzard and my tire went flat out in the middle of it. I would have been very unhappy had I not packed it.", "I was, and happy to have water, granola bars, and an extra cell phone charger!", "Thank you, I have been compiling  data for 5 years, my brain is totally absorbed by it.", "Criminal and social justice.", "Do roller coasters scare you", "I used to be afriad of heights too", "That's a bummer. Maybe next time you can join them.", "Sound like a Netflix weekend then. Hope you got a lot of work done.", "Exactly, and they never demand anything from you. When my golden retriever Louie died a few weeks ago, I honestly thought I would die too.", "Thank you, that's good to hear. I find it pretty difficult to continue on most days...but I suppose it's starting to get easier.", "It's the worst waiting for vacations! You want the time before to go fast but then it to go slow during. Never works out that way, unfortunately.", "That's great! I'm glad you had a good time. I've never been on a cruise before but it sounds like I need to try one out!", "And how is she doing now", "That is awesome.  Sometimes a second opinion is all you need", "aww that's too bad.  I hope you got some solid netflix in at least!", "bummer.  Well I hope you get a chance to do that soon!", "Oh that sounds fun!", "That isn't good at all, glad you didn't have an accident. ", "Did you find any good companies.", "Did you have alot of accidents that can jack your rates up.", "It's okay! Try to rest on the couch and that might help!", "I know that feeling all too well. But don't get down on it, just try better tomorrow.", "That must have been scary.  Is that the first time it has happened to you?", "Are you able to do anything to prevent them?", "We have been driving around all evening looking for him. He really is my best friend.", "We will have to go there next, hopefully he is chilling there. ", "Aww, I'm sorry to hear that.  Was it a bad break up or did you part on good terms?", "That's really odd.  I wonder why they didn't have the courtesy to let you know that they'd lost interest or whatever the case may be.  To just cut off contact seems a little rude.", "I will, you never know when someone else is in need! ", "It is, I have been so blessed in my life! ", "How exciting, is he a non-traditional student?", "That is really good, speaking from experience, all military men and women should get a degree.", "No poisoning, but my burger had a long hair in it, so I couldn't eat it.", "So gross, that is certain.", "Oh no! I hope you did not burn yourself.", "Hopefully you were wearing dark clothing, coffee on light colors stinks!", "I went for a drink downstairs, and the back door was wide open. I didn't sleep a wink and kept my phone and a big knife with me the rest of the night,lol.", "I really was, and I'm supposed to be the grown up, but I got my daughter to lie next to me.", "Ugh that's so annoying. What are they even barking at?", "Yeah, that would drive me crazy. Sounds like the neighbor needs to control their dogs.", "I do that all the time, no big deal.", "What kind of pizza did you eat?", "That is such a relief, it is so nice to have money saved up in the bank. ", "Oh yeah, retirement will come before you know it, it is good to be prepared! ", "I am teaching at a small private school, so I will be teaching all the subjects for 3rd grade. I am pretty excited, just nervous. ", "It really is, you are molding their future! ", "That sucks, will she not let you see the dog at all?", "Yes, that is probably a positive.", "They don't want to. I lost mine or it was stolen. But all my autopay bills are at a standstill and the companies are not happy about it.", "It is, to say the least. But at leaast it will be over at some point.", "oh that is awesome. what does she do?", "that is great. my sister is an account too. she's also the office manager.", "Congrats to your friend! That is an amazing accomplishment.", "I would be proud of her too! Hopefully her success continues.

But I made an 84 on my physics test and need an 86.", "Hopefully, I don't even understand how others get all A's.", "Thats awesome, can we trade?", "That is a really good idea.

Finding a gig is so difficult, I'm glad that it is working for you.", "5", "That is fantastic. Any good new lately?", "That is an amazing feeling. ", "did you go to the doctor", "yuk for sure", "I certainly would have liked to, but I'm lactose intolerant! If I had eaten it, I would have been so miserable that there's no way she would've mistaken it.", "She probably did, during one of those nights when she stumbles into the apartment at 3am, drunk, with some random guy she brought home from the club.", "Either he ate it, or she did and she just doesn't remember doing it. All I know is that I didn't do it, and I'm about to hulk out!", "You will be fine. Its going to be hard but dont beat yourself up over it.", "Then it sounds like you are already ahead of most new fathers. ", "That would be pretty cool to see, but you should know that typically most cats swish their tail when they're annoyed or angry! It didn't attack you, did it?", "Ahh, okay. Yeah I don't know. It might have also been scared or feeling like it had to protect it's turf. But still, that's neat to see and not an everyday thing!", "Nice, I guess the only times I was nervous to take a test was when I wasn't prepared, but there's only so much preparation you can do until you just have to trust your brain or whatever", "Wow! You must have like every technique in your toolbox to go for that goal", "i bet it does bud, I know the feeling. So how do you deal with it", "yes i know, good memories do help. every relation is a new chapter in the book called our life.", "sometimes they cant avoid it ", "ok", "Uh oh, did he destroy something? Sounds as though he misbehaved a bit.", "2", "Oh god. Was it big?", "Well, maybe look at its lifespan? Maybe it'll die if you end up not finding it.", "what does she draw", "thats awesome", "Kayla sounds wonderful! How long have you guys been friends?", "Finding someone like that is rare. Take good care of that one!", "It's stage two. I think I'll be able to beat it because I'm otherwise in great health, and it hasn't metastasized or anything. I just wasn't expecting to have to deal with this incredibly difficult time ahead of me.", "Thank you so much for being supportive. :)", "Not a chance! I was too scared to go out, and I didn't want to peek my head out to talk to the police or anything when they showed up. I honestly thought someone might have barged into my house and started trying to shoot me.", "Only the couple of hours before the gunshots woke me up. After that, no way jose.", "Seems to have, yeah. He has a lot less neck pain now than he has this past year, but that's happened during his previous neck surgeries as well.", "Yes, hopefully he does, because this was one of the last neck surgeries they were willing to do before fusing his neck completely, not allowing him to be able to turn his head anymore.", "I'm so sorry!  Don't lose hope though. I know some science based nutrition that helps you overcome and kill it going high nutrition plant based vegan.  Look up Dr. Joel Furhman.  It'll save you from all the meds that hurt your body.", "I know it must be overwhelming you but coming from someone that is fighting chronic epstein barr virus and Lupus, it will change your life.  Check out HIV and going vegan on youtube and thebody,com and so many other resources.  You might be able to reverse it and it wouldn't even be a concern for having kids.  You take care and have hope!", "Sounds like you're feeling nostalgic.  What games were you plaing?", "I've never played it but its supposed to havea bunch of old game characters in it", "Oh, how did it go?", "I'm sorry, I am sure you will be ready next time.", "Wait, why would you be annoyed by that? That's amazing!", "I think you need to look at the bigger picture, though. Someone cured a disease that has caused so much suffering for so many people. Though I suppose to can be both excited for the discovery and jealous at the same time. The two aren't mutually exclusive.", "What movie did you see", "Yeah I have heard bad things to be honest", "Wow. Does he usually do stuff like that?", "Damn well, he's gonna have to learn some boundaries with that.", "It is indeed unfair, they shouldn't have done that", "you are right. But hey people just do what they want to!!", "I bet that was awkward", "I guess that happens sometimes, did you finish the game", "Yeah, tell me about it! I trusted her to only cheat on me with other men, but I just don't know how I can deal with this betrayal!!!", "Not like this! She assured me that she wasn't that type of girl, and I was stupid enough to believe her.", "Yes indeed! what did you do?", "You did great! Family comes first. And you gave him your support!", "No no, see, it was the first grade below an A that he's ever made. I honestly thought I had the next Einstein on my hands. Now I guess I'll have to settle for...above average, I guess. :(", "He seemed fine about it, which is weird because he's always been so proud to bring home straight As. I'm really hoping he does turn it around next year. I also hope he's not on drugs or something. I suppose we'll see.", "Wow, is that true? That's pretty amazing! I'd say science should know about your dog.", "Wow, that surely is incredible! Even the accent too? And intelligent! The full package!", "Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well. I would relish the opportunity to eat alongside you one day at the troughs of battle. Be warned, however: only those with the strongest of stomachs have ever dared to challenge me!", "Hmph. Well, you should check the by-laws. Major League Eating Official Rulebook page 42, section 4.2.b strictly forbids the usage of cyanide as a food enhancement. You must eat the food as is. So I'm afraid I'll have to report you to the governing board and get you disqualified.", "That is so nice of him. Are you feeling better?", "That's good to hear. I hope I meet someone that will do that for me.", "Yes, it definitely did. It reminded me of a simpler time, before she abandoned our family to join the local nudist colony. Oh, I do miss her though. She was just the best!", "I'm just saying I respect her life choices, but she was a great mom while she was around. I think she's brave.", "That's a tragedy! What ever did you do?!?!", "Serves her right! These animals can't go around thinking they can poop on our things!", "Holy moses, he must be as smart as me. I solved that thing in five minutes last week. Child's play.", "Yeah, that's what they tell everyone because, in reality, they blew all the prize money on the very same thing themselves. I was pretty peeved that I couldn't even get a dime bag and the sleeziest of hookers.", "Ahh, that's too bad, did you mention it to your boss?", "Oh I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe next time!", "I bet. That is so sad. I am so sorry.", "I bet! I hope they can find peace soon.", "Time will make it better. You just have to move on.", "Better to find out now then move in and invest your time. Trust me it's worse.", "Really? What kind was it?", "Oh I love apple pie with ice cream, it's such a good combination", "Nice, I wish I could get a pair of those shoes.", "How much did you pay for them?", "I love a warm fire outside while camping! Sounds like a great time.", "Yes that sounds like a wonderful way to sleep.", "That sounds like it could be quite a scary experience.", "Oh yeah that's a bit dangerous. Candles are good to have on hang.", "Why are you worried?", "That is true but Dubai is a bit better", "Oh no! Was it still there when you went back?", "You never know these days. Luckily there are cameras everywhere.", "why? are you having financial problems?", "oh god , that sounds horrible but at least nothing bas happened to you!", "Oh no, what did you do to stay cheerful ?", "Sounds good, when she got back I hope you schooled her on Halo ?", "what kind of health problems ?", "i'm glad you feel good today!", "Ahh, then you know exactly what I mean. I don't see a single thing wrong with my plan. I'm not sure why everyone is so worried about North Korea or Iran or Russia or something when it's just like...get a school desk. It's not hard, people.", "Actually a genius, I love it. Parents and teachers tried to tell us that going to school would prepare us for the world. We just didn't know how right they were, did we?", "That's normal. Try to just be your self. I'm sure it will work out fine.", "Amen, me too.   I hate my current job.", "Me too. I live in a first floor apartment and it gets so dusty. Now I'll be able to clean the carpet and the couch! Funny how some strange things lift your spirits.", "Hope so. I'm moving out of this apartment and into another one in a few weeks, so I want it to be really clean.", "That's good. I know that would be difficult.", "That is great. I am sure you are proud and you should be!", "Not really, but my current upstairs neighbors are awful and I feel it'd be worth moving just to get away from them!", "Lucky you! And you're bang on about the 3am parade - sounds like a herd of elephants. Maybe I should speak with the current tenant of my new place before moving - just to see how the neighbors are.", "It has been amazing! We have enjoyed every minute of the last 2 years. My kids are seeing and experiencing things that they may have never been able to see or do. ", "Thank you! We have had so much fun an dI now realize that I had nothing to be so worried about lol.", "Yes I feel like that every time I look at old pictures!", "I agree and time jut goes by too fast!", "Do you reach out to your friends from your childhood?", "Exhaust all options, social media is a big way to stay connected", "It was a carpet/upholstery cleaner and is quite heavy. I'm disabled, so wouldn't have been able to carry it. They don't normally do deliveries, so I thought that was really nice of him to do that.", "The service they provide is so considerate and thoughtful. I'd probably move out of the complex if it wasn't for the staff!", "Nice do you still keep in touch with her", "Well if you stay in touch then I'm sure she'll come back...but in the meantime try to take your mind off her or get involved in something fun so you have cool stories to tell her", "Lots of things. I like historical novels and legal dramas best. What about you? Does reading give you a sense of relaxation?", "There's no finer book to help you in distressful times than the Bible.

What are you going to do with the money.", "Don't spend it all in one place :)", "Putting it away for a rainy day is the best bet.,", "Haha, that's a nice way to enjoy a sad moment, how are you feeling recently?", "I'm happy to hear you're doing better. If you feel that way again please reach out.", "Oh my, you must have been annoyed with your cat. I guess he just wanted your attention.", "Aw he's just a kitty after all. I'm sure he didn't mean to make you mad.", "What prize was it, or what was the competition, rather? I'm interested to know, but don't want to pry, if you don't feel like saying.", "Ah, gotcha. It's good to see that you tried and that you care that much. Most people are too lazy or scared to compete in things, myself included. I hope you continue to do the things that make you competitive and interested.", "Was it any good?", "Sometimes the cheap things are the best", "I bet it is! When my grandma was alive it was so heartbreaking to see her in pain. She broke her hip right before her death and she just couldn't recover", "i hope she will recover soon. Stay strong and think positive", "Kazakhstan. I miss it and i miss my parents and friends so much", "not bruno but borat lol such a stupid movie. I honestly can't stand that actor and his toilet humor", "That's great that they accomplished that and even better that you recognize their achievements.", "OK I didn't realize that they may have gone after you were born as opposed to before.", "aren't you afraid of the wild animals that will be roaming the area?", "That sounds peculiar. I've never known a dog with such finesse, yours may have talent.", "That's really cool, it makes me want to consider getting a dog.", "what did she do ?", "wow that was nice of her", "What kind of gaming is it?", "That's sounds interesting!", "I have been instructing for 12 years but skydiving for 25", "You shoudl definitely try it!", "Considering I've been using a walker for the past two years, yes it is.

What are you bidding for", "Archie? marvel? dc?", "Sometimes dogs just bark a lot. Did anything happen?", "Thank goodness. I'd be scared, too. You can't really know whether a dog is harmless or not sometimes.", "It has, what did you see that impressed you?", "They're more powerful than that. More like an early 2000's computer.", "What did i tell you about doing that. It was a chocolate cake right?", "Ok, at least it was the right kind of cake you liked. But still not a good thing.", "That is really great.  You don't find too many people willing to help others financially.  Do you have a really good job?", "It's good just to have enough these days.", "Which film was it?", "I haven't heard of it, sounds interesting though.", "Nice! You just don't expect it in a rural area. Well, I didn't anyway. We have large grocery stores and a little (but very good) organic grocery store. Quite incredible.", "I find it hard to believe, myself! This is the rural south, yet there are fine dining restaurants, the aforementioned store, really good independent stores selling all sorts of stuff.", "Really? It doesn't bother me at all. I wonder why you feel that way?", "Well, most people have intense likes and dislikes. Personally, I can't stand cigar smoke, but some people love it! I guess in your case, you need to scrape the food off the plate first.", "I can imagine they are a right pain to pick up after!", "What an annoyance!", "Oh me too. I'm not a driver but that is so annoying.", "It can be really dangerous too", "That is terrible.  Was it dead or just injured?", "That is true.  I would hate for people to be shooting things that close to my house, too.  Do you know who it was?", "What's been holding you back?", "That's a tough decision to make. It's good to try new things sometimes and I'm sure the waiters can recommend you a nice meal you'll enjoy based off your preferences.", "About once a week. Her husband works in the store, so he brings her food in regularly. It's such a pleasure to find such a thing - I missed my Indian food!", "Well, my uncle's Indian and his sisters and mother taught my aunt to cook, and she taught me. But I'm disabled right now so can't cook much. This is such a find!", "That's awesome!  Have you gotten any better yet?", "That would be cool.  Hopefully the hard work will pay off", "Urgh that sounds like the worst! How early?", "So inconsiderate! It reminds me of my neighbours doing building work one morning at 6AM!", "Me too! ", "How many times do you need to tell them!? :(", "I tend to believe that those who have Biblical faith do have a certainty, that God will bless them despite circumstances. ", "Oh really, when are you going to go see her?", "I hope you have a good time at the concert, and she sings all the songs you're looking forward to.", "It really was - I can't wait to move in! It's a smaller apartment, but quieter (I hope!).", "You'll get there. It really is nice to have your own space. Do you live at home?", "Good for you! Start saving your money now - believe me, you'll need it!", "Those are my nightmares. They are so big where I live in the South.", "I would immediately start spraying bug spray all over. Those things terrify me. ", "I put music on and open the window. Otherwise I'll disappear into my own little world, and that's not a good thing to do when you're driving!", "It really helps to pass the time, not to mention it can calm you down. And the drive's quite easy and very pretty, which help.", "Thats awesome.  What kind of computer are you getting?", "very nice.  Id be super excited too.  Have some fun playing with it", "It helps me a lot as I'm disabled and it can be quite difficult. Anyway, I hate grocery shopping!", "Ugh. And don't even get me started on \"mini-shoppers\" racing round the aisles screeching! Much better to have someone else buy for me!", "I haven't heard of that movie. What's depressing about it?", "Oh dear. I think I'll give it a miss - I cry at the drop of a hat! You should watch a comedy next, just to cheer yourself up!", "ohhh cute!! i am so happy for you, smart boy!", "a rare one, i hope he goes a long way and maybe even be the next Einstein we need", "What did you do there?", "Sounds painful, did you have to go to the doctor?", "oh god, that must have been the worst way to wake up in the morning", "oh, do you have any revenge planned?", "That is really scary!  What was it?", "Yuck!  Stay away from that guy!", "I love all over Italy, but I also loved Germany and France and Spain.", "Yes it was truly an amazing time meeting people from so many different cultures", "Lol! I thought you were going to say MESSY! Good kids!", "So true! Maybe they want something or they did something bad and are hiding it lol", "Lol ;) Well enjoy the clean house, don't worry about the rest!", "I found it using the Internet.

I have been there before. It was really sad.", "It is sometimes for the best but that doesnt always make it easy. ", "How did you do that? Naturally or with chemo?", "I bet! Look in too Chlorella and similar to get rid of any toxins from the chemo :)", "oh yeah? where you planning to move to?", "oh that's a very good reason to go, i am happy for you ", "this is what you need to do, get out of your car and go give them a beat down that they need", "yea but it will feel better if you take action", "I have been thinking about moving but I have lived here for over 30 years. The area has changed so much.", "My fear is that I wont find a safer place. Not much money to find a good neighborhood to move into.", "Cool! That sounds like a great time!", "Wow that's pretty deep!", "Wow, that had to be quite a surprise.  I hope you like them", "Well thats good.  Hopefully it was a good party!", "What brand are they?", "That is crazy did you go return them maybe?", "and what happened?", "how long is a marathon?", "Are you nervous?", "Good Luck!", "Oh no! I hope no one took it!", "Did you go back for it and get it?", "Wow ! thats quite an accomplishment. How long did you have to practice to perfect that ?", "Fantastic ! When you get older, your memory tends to play tricks on you lol", "Oh really? Any interesting ones?", "That's awful! Sounds like it might have caused you some trauma unfortunately.", "Did you catch the person after?", "That is unreal, what did you have in the bags?", "oh my gosh. what happened to him?", "i bet is was. are you ok?", "Oh my god, that is a LOT of weight!", "That's really cool, I honestly can't even imagine someone lifting that much!", "I've been to one before with my girlfriend, what an amazing experience eh?", "Aren't you the luckiest?

It's good to treat yourself some times.", "You will just make sure you have your nice new shirt on with that cool necklace and you will be all eyes lol.", "It could be a medical problem. Make sure its checked out.", "Ohh I see. That is super annoying. Hopefully she gets over this phase and they get along.", "You must have really proud of yourself. Its good to acknowledge your own achievements from time to time.", "I agree, which is why getting into that position can be so gratifying. Hopefully you maintain that level of hard work that got you there.", "oh that sounds nice", "sounds like a great time, hopefully its not too hot out there", "That sounds like heaven to me as well", "I have a cat too close to me, they are the best", "Oh thoughtful ! Did she enjoy playing with it ?", "Its quite wonderful to share your childhood memories with your children isn't it ?", "Congratulations.

I hope your coworkers went easy on you about it. You must've had a lot of static electricity.", "How awful!  Do you know who did it?", "Yes at least there is that.  But it must be really scary to deal with someone willing to go that far.", "It must have been a very difficult  speech, specially since I imagine you were really sad and moved.", "Of course,  do you feel prepared to do it then?", "Yes I do.  Its a fun job.", "Yes I am a skydiving instructor so it is fun", "Yes I love it", "Yes! Thank goodness. They didn't cancel. I just got home much later than I had hoped.", "Absolutely.

What happened?", "Is he okay now?", "Yes, I prayed about it multiple times, and by the last night, I was able to feel the Spirit move and I was able to praise and worship too.

He is all knowing and I'm just so thankful that he cares about me.", "I've never done that but i know plenty of people who do that.

I was very nervous", "Next week I think", "Oh, I would love time away like that! How did you enjoy it?", "That sounds wonderful! My body is craving something like this. Thanks for the inspiration!", "Oh no, did they do something embarrasing?", "That's absolutely disgusting!", "Did the two of you have fun?", "That's awesome. My son has a skateboard but can barely stand up on it.", "I am sorry that you are out of work.  Have you had any job interviews? It is good that your father is able to help you during this time.", "Well, I am glad you will hopefully get some disability income.  It sounds like your dad isn't the type who expects to be repayed.  He sounds like a great parent.", "Did everything work out ok? How did you like them?", "Oh, me too. I don't even like to sit in the waiting room.", "Interesting, are you feeling OK having less bonding time?", "I see, I imagine time will start to fly once you take up a new hobby, or school ends for the day.", "Same. I wish I had just stayed at home instead of spending all that time on the road.", "That is true, I guess there is that to be thankful for.", "Ew, that's always the worst. What were you getting?", "That's always the case! So annoying. I love the self checkout options. I wish more places had that.", "Oh no! I am sorry to hear of your loss. Are you taking it ok?", "Yeah, funerals are really sad but they can make one appreciate life so much more.", "Wow i'd be jealous", "Same.

I get more irritated finding out she lied about it.", "Oh, I've tried...", "Yikes, that doesnt happen too often in today's culture.  Did you say anything?", "That might be for the best.  Were they arguing about her color or something else?", "Thats really annoying. It would be great if people would just let other people be.", "I'm sorry you don't get to see her much. I don't see mine often either. I'm sure it did make you sad.", "Yeah, I understand that. I live about 45 minutes from mine and everyone is so busy all the time. Maybe you will be able to see her soon.", "Great! Are you home all day or do you just get them off to school and then head to work yourself?", "For sure! I bet it was nice to have the hosue a little more quiet too.", "Oh that must have been torture! Is everything alright?", "I can imagine. Glad you are ok though! :)", "It really is. The worst part is that they had arguments in front of him, while he was sick, about who should get what. I wish they would have spent that time just loving and comforting him. That's what my husband and I tried to do.", "Yes, the whole situation made me mad then and mad now. There is nothing I can do though except pray about it.", "ah, you must have great memories than", "you know today's events are tomorrow's memories", "Blue catfish, they get so huge. I have a secret recipe for stink bait that works well!", "Oh I will, fried catfish is so amazing. Especially beer battered!", "Well with some locals at the local brewpub", "Yes I think I will do well even though I just learned last week how to play!", "That is ", "That is so nice when family visits.

It is getting kind of scary!", "Yeah, really don't want to deal with a flooded home! Would not be good for my family. ", "No, I ended up just suffering through it and eating it. ", "Yeah, I am afraid to return things. The clerks kind of scare me. ", "Do you feel any less nervous?  Job interviews are always nerve-wracking ", "Either way, as long as you feel a little bit better it was worth it.  I'm sure you'll do great!", "Nothing beats cookies made by grandma. Except for the oatmeal ones. Too healthy haha. ", "Only if it has raisins to sweeten them up!", "that must be a cute picture", "so young and ready to conquer the world", "What video games are the two of you playing?", "It's always amazing how quickly kids pick up on new skills.", "I do!  I've loved that particular brand for years - to me it's the best out there.  But I guess there's quite a few people out there besides me that have a real love for it!", "Oniony gold!  That's a very apt description!", "It is!  I'll actually be the manager of the entire office, and not just the one section I was in!", "I try to.  But I'm glad all the effort is being recognized!", "Wow, that's really exciting! Good for you, you must be nervous. ", "That's great, what kind of work are you in?", "Well I really hope you get it. You're right, you did what you could. ", "I have a hard enough time understanding man's inhumanity towards their fellow man, but towards animals who can't do much to defend themselves?  I hope they put those people *under* the jail!", "Where I live, they're only now starting to toughen up the animal cruelty laws.  Even so, they lag far behind a lot of other states.", "Was that a good day for you?", "That's amazing! Sounds like a beauty day! Are you English?", "Oh, but I bet you appreciated it!

I called my friend who said she was dehydrated and we did what we could, but her motor functions quit and she passed away in her sleep.", "And that kitten knew she was loved.

Back when the only buttons on a controller were Start, Select, A and B!", "Oh no! Hopefully you are able to get it sorted out. It's hard to keep up with all the fees for kids schooling.", "Sounds like a headache, i know the feeling. I got a letter saying i had a few days to purchase a purple shirt from my daughters school. Good luck!", "That would be rough.  Hopefully youre in a better spot now!  Thats awesome you had family to help you out too!", "I bet they do!

I've considered it.", "Only if you are choosing that, over real tangible moments with friends or outside people.", "That would take a miracle , or have some major money backing it.", "Take some small steps and vote in other things for people with the right values, not just pandering to the ignorant.", "For 4 years.

I hope you can find comfort during this difficult time.", "You will, and that is what gives us the strength to face tomorrow!", "Happens to everybody. My girlfriend, who is the smartest person I know, has had to make 5 duplicates of her car keys because she's locked herself out so much. She's so forgetful because she's so efficient and on top of everything else important, that sometimes she misses the small things. Maybe that's true in your case, too!", "I've heard some people place theirs in a bowl near the front door as soon as they come home, or they stick it in the fridge with their lunch.. silly things to make sure they can keep it together.", "Wow.

Sorry for your loss friend :(", "Never too old or too manly to snuggle a stuffed animal. My mom said I used to carry this blanket with me when I was a toddler, everywhere I went. I wish I still had it. If I did, I'd consider using it again, or at the very least passing it down to my own kid. What's the harm, you know? If something gives you comfort and doesn't bother anyone else, there should be no shame.", "Well, if I were you, I'd keep it up, whether or not my spouse laughed at me, or a new girlfriend/boyfriend, whatever.

That is really creepy, why is he in your backyard?", "Yeah, that's illegal I think, they need to at least knock or ring the door bell!", "I am so sorry to hear that. It can't be easy for you and your family.", "No doubt it will take time to process. I wish your family the best. Stay strong my friend.", "What shows are your favorite? That must be nice.", "Must be nice, got any nice snacks?", "Good choice. You're health is more important than some grad degree. ", "I think nowadays employers just want experience. So it should be easier once you have that. ", "Ah, I hate when that happens! How embarrassed were you?", "Sorry to hear that. Hopefully you're not seriously hurt!

But it's so great that she loves school.  I hope she loves learning her whole life.", "What went wrong?", "That is all that matters, its about the love.", "I understand. Did you told your friend?", "Wow, it is terrible.", "Did you go see who it was?", "No that's scary stuff.", "That is great. What is it fun?", "That is always difficult.", "I am single and never been married. I assume arguments are part of marriage.", "Im bad at giving advice especially to people I dont know. Im the opposite. Im too mellow. And that sometimes gets me in trouble.", "In some ways that is a bit funny but it certainly can be a scary time to come home alone to an empty dark house.", "I hope you aren't still scared of your shadow?", "I don't think you should feel too bad about missing one day!  It sounds like you're generous regularly.  I get it though.", "It's hard to see people and not be able to help.  You seem really giving!", "Children are a beautiful thing for us parents. What a great memory you have of that. ", "Thats perfect, a boy and a girl thats what most people want. congrats. ", "Just that all people should be given an equal chance in life and that no one type of person is better than another, just because of their religion or skin color, or where they come from.", "They believed that people of their religion where better than everyone else and were going to heaven, while the rest of us are left at the gate! That's one of their beliefs anyway. I don't agree with that, but chose to keep my mouth shut!", "What car did you buy?", "Jeez. Where do you live? I dont remember any state Ive been to with bad drivers.", "Good luck! My sister-in-law has been with weight watchers for a while now. She loves the camaraderie and how everyone encourages each other.", "You'll reach your goal. You just have to make small adjustments which'll sustain you throughout your life.

My poor husband had to sit every single night and test me. He's American and he didn't think he could pass!", "That must have been nice. I keep cards too.", "Of course not. There is so much paper in this house. I keep cards, photos, school projects. Everything. We arent here forever", "I found lots of things to pass down when my grandmother passed. I think they passed down their hoarding to us lol", "Lol. Me too!!", "It had been raining , so I ran across the parking lot in to the store.

That must make you feel special. My mom is dead so I understand how you feel.", "I am happy that your mom is still around.

Waiting for results can be very stressful - everything's out of your hands and all you can do is wait.", "I just feel so embarrassed - she never forgets my birthday. And my husband was away and didn't remind me :( ", "You're right. She's a very forgiving person and I've never forgotten before.

Just make sure to shave first.", "Oh man, I did too.  I still do every once in a while but only when I'm having trouble sleeping.

Are you getting a car soon too?", "Definitely, especially when you get really hungry at night. I love a good drive thru", "That is awful. I've had it happen to me once before.", "I sure hope so, too! It is a lot of work to get it sorted out. ", "Yeah... that seems like a hard gig, especially in today's day and age, where everyone's so wary, and especially since there's not often people at home during the day. You have to have good people skills to do that job, though. So, you at least probably have that going for you.", "Ah.. yeah, I'm sorry you had to run into that kind of problem.

", "That is awesome, what degree are you working towards?", "I can imagine, waiting sucks!", "That's kind of odd. I probably would have tried to take a swing just out of pure instinct. What was the reason they wanted to wake you up?", "Hahaha.. that's kind of goofy in a way. Yeah, sometimes nothing good can come of people trying to get your attention randomly in the middle of the night. That's probably the wisest choice. I probably wouldn't be able to act that good enough to pull it off.", "Ouch!  What did you take?", "Was it an awesome keyboard worth getting in trouble for?", "Congrats! Thats so exciting do You fel ok?", "YAY! good job! He/she is going to be beautiful", "I still think it is, i always get so excited", "yep thats one of the things that make it so nice", "Oh wow that is weird.

I hate hearing about children having tragic childhoods and not being able to just simply be a kid. But at least she'll have a good perspective and appreciate life more.", "Even if she does, it will help make her a well-rounded, relatable person. Usually these things help ground kids and give them character. But maybe you're right, if she moves on from it quickly, that's great too!", "What had he made in the world?", "That's super cool, I played a few years back but eventually quit.", "I am really sorry to hear that.
