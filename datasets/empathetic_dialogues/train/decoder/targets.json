Because it bothers me how she acts single on social media, and it confuses me as to whether she wants to be with me, or is just trying to live a different personality online.  Because she talks to me and is all lovey-dovey, then gets on social media and talks like I don't need anyone and talks about how hot guys are.

Where do you go?", "I think if you stay calm you'll do fine.", "Yeah, I have a friend who has gone through the same situation. She just wants whats best best for her kids. I hope things get better for you.", "It doesn't mean you are fat or overweight. Everyone is different.", "Are you from New York area. I'm a little farther south, but I do like them for sure.", "Yes. They underpay.", "I see. Well, maybe the weather is calling for some in the near future? I like sunshine, but know we need some rain too, hope you get some soon.", "i'm sorry to hear that!", "Sorry to hear, I really hope that it doesn't cost to much to fix that up.", "That's really odd, and unfortunate. Thankfully there are many more girls that would match you better :) Don't lose hope!", "Acting as a 'mentor' in these situations is always fun and it makes the whole experience better!", "What went wrong with the pizza you were trying to make?", "I am sorry to hear that.

They are like parents but more fun.", "Wow that is sad, I hope you get that fixed", "Oh I see, well that's still nice!", "That is so great, I hope you have found some healing and closure to the difficulties it caused when you were younger.", "I can understand that. It's hard to say goodbye to a friend, I hope you can stay in contact with him.", "That might be a good idea, even if just to clear you conscience of the guilt.", "Crazy they wont even eat vegetables but they will eat rat poison.", "Ah, yes, the lucrative writing career.", "Oh, nicely done, thats impressive!", "I bet that is a terrible feeling of betrayal. Friends should be more trustworthy.", "I'm glad to hear it turned out okay.", "I was in a accident years ago and found glass coming out of my scalp for weeks. So I know how it is.", "Strange they ask you to pay for college, but offer few choices.", "Yeah, it's a good thing that you have a lot of time for other more important things now.", "Although I still deal with stress occasionally, I know exactly what you mean.", "I can see that, i had my first beer at 13 due to my brother but knew it was wrong at my age.", "Remember that the universe has a perfect timing for everything. Being with someone isn't everything, be comfortable and enjoy your own company and love will come when you least expect it :)", "That is surprising. Usually these things are a popularity contest.", "I get that, but it was bound to happn at some point", "No way -- THAT'S the best. Paid for (I'm assuming) *and* running.

But sounds like you worked hard.", "I graduated that year too! Cool to see that you were as excited as he likely was.", "I undertand that. People are crazy like that, I never understood it", "I bet it was, to catch up after awhile, few things really compare", "I hope so too, and I hope that you don't have to deal with anything like that anytime soon.", "Sounds like you got your priorities straight good man.", "That is what matters, best of luck using it friend!", "I am sure that you two will have a happy and loving life together especially if she reciprocates your desire to never cheat.", "When did she move out there?", "It is always good to work out but start slowly since it has been a long time since your last work out.", "The question is, did the woman at least do a good job ( from what you could see)?", "Yes, you hear stories all of the time about people being rejected to find out that it was a blessing in disguise", "I am glad to hear that, I hope they work out for you!", "LOL It really shouldn't be funny but for some reason you are making me laugh! I guess that will teach them to leave their lunch sitting around! haha", "All the best for your future and your role aswell!", "The odds must be astronomical, almost like winning the lottery.", "Yeaah they really were, number 12 killed it with that goal", "I am in that boat at times where i live.", "Yes, those are awesome feelings, I crave that all the time", "oh darn thats just abit rude and unnecessary.

Surely there is another way", "What was the issue that plagued you?", "Why did he get the promotion over you?", "I've heard great things about Reddit but have never actually signed up myself!", "I would be too! That sounds like a real inconvenience.", "Always, it is. And it sounds empty to say it will all work out for the best....but it will! In the meantime, are you applying/interviewing for other positions?", "I see where you're coming from.", "Wow that's neat! Crazy to hear he lost then as you said.", "Oh, okay, well I watched a documentary about healthcare in other countries. I understand that doesn't apply here.", "I'm sorry to hear that.  I hope you make a speedy recovery!", "That is nice! I wish I can go to those countries", "I wish you all the best pal ! You will surely rock !", "You konw, sometimes consulting  a psy is a good investment. Dont be afraid to do that.", "Huh, I see.

That, and time. But still -- it's difficult!", "How often do you play?", "I hope you were able to get it turned right back on in order to have directions to get where you were going.", "Yeah, sadly our world leaders are too focused on flexing instead of working towards creating a world that is sustainable and liveable for our grandchildren's children", "I would have peed in my pants if i was there.", "That is a great feeling i bet! Good job man!", "I can imagine it must have been very distressing. Glad that you were OK.", "Surely you were able to explain that this was out of your control.", "Did you speak to a counselor, priest, or family member about it?", "How long did you stay alone?", "I feel for me it's just getting to the slopes more often too.", "Do you have a professional degree in first aid?", "I know what you mean. It's like you have to dress for both the outside *and* the inside. That's great you have a pool in which to escape, though!", "Ugg I am sorry to hear that. Sometimes dealing with land lords is a tough business.", "That's understandable. I hope everyone you know is doing well from back then!", "I'm so sorry you had to go through that.", "Did you know the person who was with him?", "Man that is crazy! Especially that song!", "Yeah, sometimes it can be annoying though because they come to you with really easy problems to fix and you feel like they should know how to do it themselves.", "I hope the email will bring you good news", "Because mine does the same thing... If its not video games its the TV on full blast haha! Tell him you need your beauty sleep.", "Wow! I would have told her to fill out the paperwork herself getting your hopes up like that.", "Awww well I am glad he was understanding about it.", "So you all had relatively all his life.

My family was the same way, and I still remember coming home after my last day of 6th grade and seeing that same SNES box sitting on my bed.", "I know the feeling too well! Hopefully you get a good's night rest tonight.", "Thinking like that seems stressful", "No need to kiss butt.  Maintain your integrity and enjoy life on it's terms.", "Is that a video game?", "That wasn't very nice of them.  It's quite common to forget things.  Hopefully next time you remember!", "My wife and I have been together for 12 years, tried years ago and nothing. Waited a while and then started trying again and we got it. Fate has a funny way of working out.", "That is great.", "Well make sure you listen to your Dr.'s advice!", "Happily, a lot of employers seem to be willing to extrapolate that if you had talents in one industry, they'd apply to another. You can always learn about different subjects; you can't always learn how to bring that special spark that customer service needs. Best of luck!", "That stinks. I've been interviewing also. I had two places call me back for three interviews and then no offer. So I feel ya. Just keep looking.", "Was it a long move?", "What games did you play at the time?", "That's awful, people need to be more careful", "Awe, I am sorry. In those instances, nobody wins.

I'm sorry you had to go through that.", "Isn't that weird? I mean it takes *energy* to be that negative! Does your brother feel that too? Or just can't/won't see it?", "That's terrific. Hopefully she continues to get better and better.", "Did you confront him", "Oh no! I hope you can fix it!", "It sounds hard! What grade did you get?", "Yes or rich. When I was a kid I wanted to grow up. Now that I'm old I want to be a kid again.", "I agree, you made the right choice. And it gives you time to get to know the hosts before a future sleepover!", "Well, sounds like your boss is stressed out too much and taking it out on you! Maybe he needs a long break!", "I wish he would have! The Heat can use his help! Haha!", "I can imagine!  I remember finding out I got free tickets to Disney World one time, I was ecstatic.", "man I was hoping they would be able to help in some way!  I hope they didn't take anything to personal!", "This is true for me as well, I have a 17 and 19 years old. I can't believe it, and just turned 40 on the 5th.", "Really? Same..I was about 5 in the deep end by myself.  How old were you?", "I prefer Tinder.", "This is very true, But would you want to be bugged by people all the time.", "Cool. I liked Pokemon blue.", "No one is smart until they learn to be smart. We are all born with brains but not smarts. We must gain smarts.", "You have to work hard and get good at somehting.", "I did the same with mine. I lived with her during the summers and went home when school started back.", "Trust me I've been there! Some days are better than others.

I love them all!", "I have never been there but I have heard that before too.  I am sorry you have to deal with that.", "Do you take any mediciation?", "I do not just a cat", "I usually hear that that is one of the problems with having a truck lol, always being the first people call to help.  Do you like it better than a car?", "Oh wow that is far. Are you moving for a job?", "I have been there too, very lonely", "It's unfortunate that they would take their word over yours.  It shows how little they knew you.", "wow, you must be so proud of yourself! Good job!", "I understand what you mean. I feel like a better person and know I have accomplished something by making them feel better also.", "Oh my!  I have never heard that before.

I hate being an adult sometimes!", "thats cool", "I have and it didn't go so well for me. I hope your experience is!", "That's cool I remember it was a big theme in Nickelodeon.

I hope you can one day overcome your fear. Most dogs are very friendly.", "That isn't nice.", "Dang.. I love Dr. Pepper too. They can be selfish sometimes, but we just have to remember that they have developed the parts of their brain to make them care about more than just themselves.", "Wow. I could never do that. I dont think I could.", "That's crazy! You deserve just as much props as he does! I'm glad you guys stuck it through. That's incredibly rare.", "Yeah, they do have those sticky traps that you can put out to catch them once they spray really good. We dealt with roaches before, but got rid of them.", "You should buy some spray.", "Are you serious? I bet that was fun, to see you guys get to the Super Bowl on that. Memorable night.", "I hope you didn't pay full price.", "Try hard not too. That's the best you can do", "very difficult. If you hadn't eaten it the child most likely wouldn't have wanted it.", "You should do it, even 15 minutes.", "Shy? Yeah, I get that. I was too, until I started getting out more. The ability to socialize is a muscle you have to work at.", "Sorry to hear that", "Hah. I would have to. I would have booked it the second I saw it. People could prank me easily with fake snakes if they wanted to.", "What do you do, if you don't mind me asking?", "Awesome! my wife and I got married 2 years ago, I hope we make it 30 years like your parents!", "Fantastic! What kind of dog is he?", "I'm happy she is doing well and making changes!", "I've never potty trained them. At what age does that normally happen? 3?", "Lol. It does seem like that sometimes. They can sit on the blinds for forever and move at the last second when you swing the swatter. Like Seal Team Six flies or something.", "I was in a car wreck once.", "Do you paint your face and buy everything from your favorite team?", "Wow that's right around the corner!  New Orleans is the PERFECT place for a celebration, too!", "Hey that's still fun! I spent mine on paying off a credit card in part, which is boring but lead to more money in the long run.", "How long will you go for?", "Well, you live and you learn. At least you can bake, or try to. I don't hardly cook at all, besides simple things!", "I've heard about people doing that... Man, it's incredible how much your diet can affect you. I'm really happy for you guys.", "I know exactly how you feel.  I have great parents as well and it makes me want to be the same kind of parent for my kids!", "Glad to hear it. Hopefully you didn't have any electronics with you... That would be my worst nightmare!", "Haha I bet! Always great to have everyone together, though, really gets your mind off all the stresses of daily life.", "They'll be other interviews.", "I didn't realize it was ending? You must be disappointed.", "Yikes. If I was you, I would get my own gun! Better to have it and not need it, then have not have it then need it!", "OH wow! I feel you there and it's totally worth it! If you have to sit- get a donut pillow to not sit on your tailbone.", "Oh wow that's horrible.", "I hear that stuff is bad for you.", "How fast did they say you were going?", "That is great news.", "Hmmmm. with no job and no way to pay it back I sure hope he can be understanding.", "Oh. I've never seen that show. I know it has die hard fans though.", "Oh man, that's doubly terrible! Yeah, if you can, you should try to make a budget and get better at cooking for yourself. Huge money saver, but I'm sure you already knew that. I hope it works for you, though.", "MOst work requires multi tasking. Yes that is true. You sound like you already have a good head on your shoulders.", "No kidding... Who goes out of their way to get a lawnmower? Like... Why risk getting arrested and going to jail for a lawnmower... Oh well... Humanity. Sorry to hear that happened to you.", "Oh wow, I can't imagine losing my dad at 67. I hope you make it through these hard times, stay strong!", "Haha... That sounds awesome. Wish I could carpool with her. I hate driving, but it sounds like she loves it.", "Not to mention enjoy the actual party, too!  Are you celebrating anything in particular?", "Yeah, I mean things happen. Better to put it in the back of your head and keep trucking along.", "That's a good way to do it. especially because it's easy to get those post-vacation blues. That's actually really smart", "You don't have to tell me, I know you'll ace it! You sound well prepared.", "Yeah, I know. Adrenaline gets to you. You're human. At least you were doing it in a sort of safe way, it sounds like. Some cops are just out to get you.", "I would do that! Or call a friend over- Get a weapon too.", "Man.. Good luck with that. Sounds like it will be hard to fight them. But I hope it works out for you.", "I'm happy you got to avoid that!", "That's sneaky... and hard to explain. I'm sorry you have to deal with that hard situation. What do you think you'll do about it?", "Yes i do have 2 siblings, older brother and younger sister, but we dont fart in front of eachother, i love them!", "Oh man! I grew up on that cartoon too!", "Hahaha... Good point. I understand. Some things are just more important, fair point. My fault on assuming your age.", "Yes, I hope so. Well, I hope your brother can put his degree to good use and make some moolah!", "Not really, especially since they vary sometimes by region. We should just move to Europe, I hear they have great internet there because they actually view it as important.", "sadly we all know that everyone and everything is going to die, but that is why we need to really live while we are able. Don't retreat. Embrace everyone who is close to you.", "Hope it's a friendly one at least.", "Maybe her first class seat should be on the royal porcelain seat!", "It is.  It isn't healthy to be by yourself for too long.  Humans are social creatures!", "Yea I totally understand where you're coming from. Hopefully someone nearby was able to call CPS or law enforcement.", "Well there you go, at least you a got a positive out of a negative situation haha!", "Oh wow, yeah that sounds gross! I agree with the wasted food too. There are starving people all around the world!", "Im sorry, I know how much that stinks, like when you really really want Chickfila and its Sunday...", "Well that was a surprise I bet.", "Flying scares a lot of people but it's safer then driving over all.", "She sounds like a wonderful person.", "Thats so cool, do you have any othe children or just one? when you have more they are very competitive", "I really hate bad drivers.", "Yeah, alot of times you just have to be reminded why you broke up.  I know there is someone out there for you, just stay positive and they will come your way!", "Hopefully she doesn't do it again.", "Yeah, especially fire ants. Those are nasty little buggers.", "Yea, same, it's nice to be out of school. All that learning pays off though!", "I hope you just walked away dude. Nothing good can come of that. I bet you were furious.", ":( That is messed up, did he/she show any warning signs before their passing? It's not your fault by the way.", "That wasn't nice of them.", "I know she will make it.", "That sounds like a lot of fun. What kind of cake did you select?", "You probably should have moved with a shovel of something, instead of running over it", "I know right? Doesn't seem right. Especially with the whole Russian interference with the election.", "I think mine have two weeks left.", "Did you have a flashlight?", "That terrible. Were you able to get a refund?", "Why not send her to summer camp?", "What did you spend it on?", "I have never seen it.", "That would be an amazing neighbor! I would be so worried!", "Maybe you can renew your vows one day.", "Yes, id he do it for money?", "I understand", "I do hope nothing of value was stolen. I would be frantic if someone stole my family heirlooms.", "How far did they have to travel?", "What did you use to do for work?", "His tweets are rude and ill informed and he never apologizes for anything.", "Did you get it free? I would be so annoyed!", "That really sucks. Fortunate to hear that no one misused it though. They are typically pretty fast at sending you a new one.", "Oh! Well duh, silly me. I thought it was food or something. Do you sell other things too?", "They will find who did it.", "How caring of you.", "What did you bowl?", "Yes, especially for all those emails they found on her private server. Despicable.", "I sure hope that you did. Statistics is tough!", "It has to be enough - that's the whole reason why we seek out a soulmate. I do hope things get better.", "Yes I have won a few poker tournaments.", "Ahhh, so you're upset at your past self? We all make mistakes, man, it's good. What we think is good for us sometimes turns out to not be, but hindsight is twenty twenty.", "Yea construction zones are crazy, so often nooones there!", "That could lead to a gambling problem! I always run away with my winnings.", "Unfortunately, yes. I had to get a few staples in my head but my car was totaled...", "Yup, I used to procrastinate all the time, but I think I am getting better at doing things ahead of time. And it feels so much better to get trivial things out of the way.", "That's even more saddening. Did you get to say somewhat of a goodbye to him at their funeral?", "That is mean.", "I don't like 100+ degree days myself!", "At the time it was a change and I like the ride of it, but I did not realize I would miss the sedan as much as I did.", "That is terrifying indeed! I hoped you swatted that beast with the biggest fly swatter available.", "You'll do fine. I look at new things as adventures.", "Maybe if you post to social media, a bunch of random strangers will show up.", "Yea, hope he can make it up the rest of the year.", "Throw it in your neighbor's trash can. I'm sure they would understand?", "What kind of toppings did it have on it?", "Yikes! I hope you didn't have any car damage.", "Oh god, that's the worst part. The shame afterwards....", "Me too. Its always the worst when you are trying to get into the carpool line.", "What are you going to do now?", "Make sure you drink water also.", "Lol- sounds like fun! Nothing better than nice hippies!", "Oh, I see. Your mom is an angel!", "So sorry to hear that.  I hope that the pain fades with time.", "Oh ok i get it, well you just will have to save longer, thanks God its painless!", "I hope you had fun with her.", "Hahaha, you are very adamant I see.", "Why did you break up?", "yeah I guess so what did they do to you?", "You totally aren't sorry. You are being super gross! lol. TMI", "What happened if you don't mind me asking?", "They are nice looking cars and I have heard are great to off road in!", "I'm so sorry that happened to you, better luck next time.", "Maybe you should slow down and only drink a bit at a time.", "Haha, yea, no one ever tells you how bad it really is. We get charged for every little thing.", "Woman lol", "I guess they have never heard of a personal bubble.", "true! Thank you- It is very real", "That's great to know there are still good people in this world.", "I bet that brought back a lot of memories!", "Nice, do you play football too?", "I love video games.", "Did you call the police?", "Can you give me an example?", "Okay cool, I'm not that big into sports.", "Who got them for you?", "That will be a nice change of pace! Do you have plans for retirement?", "I have seen them leave whole foods in movies. gross", "I do to, but there are so many unhappy people in the world and they seem to think they have to make everyone else around them unhappy.", "I haven't really watched it on TV but my family watches it sometimes.", "How many hours did you put into it.", "What part of being a musician appeals to you?", "It's always good to have happiness even in times of worry and panic. So, I'm glad you still have some optimism!", "Sounds like that person has boundary issues. My ex's brother did that bother and I quickly nipped that behavior in the bud. Good on you for stopping that. Is he in too drugs or something or just entitled?", "I loved his song Starfish & Coffee when I was little.", "How much is a ticket?", "That would be awesome. I bet it was a really great concert.", "Did he go to college?", "I hope so too, good luck!", "Im sure they can figure something out. They might be able to remove the harddrive to recover the photos.", "Oh no! Did she have a microchip?", "Yes it is. I would be furious!", "Im sure she is in a better place. Looking down on you.", "Good luck to you!", "I would just throw the bottles back at them", "Oh geez- work on your side hustle and get out of there. I did a long time ago. Hate those jobs!", "I would be so happy if they could find a cure for cancer.", "Thats awesome. She will do great in college.", "Yay you! I hope your next project turns out just as good.", "Oh no! I know it stinks but maybe one day you can forgive her- I hope...", "Oh man! It's hard when those accidents happen.", "Good luck!", "It would have sucked more if it was raining. Hopefully you have some good vibes come your way.", "Well I am sorry to hear that. If you need anyone to talk to let me know.", "medicine and/or nursing, initially also liked psychiatry but then realised that its history is full of abuse and horror, some of which still is ongoing so i didnt want to participate in that. What can one use a business management degree for? Do you literally become a manager in some business or how does that work?", "Yeah! People tend to be lazy and not take down the posting once they have filled the position and the automated emails will send a canned response instead.", "Well, I hope everything turns out okay for you.", "Irma last year", "Wow, that's a lot, what type of vehicle?", "What color were they ?", "Tissue is so expensive, it's unbelievable", "that makes sense, but I guess everyone needs food!", "I think I remember watching it. How old were you then?", "Yeah, whenever I miss my childhood I try to spend the time with the kids. So we can feel better.", "Me too, I am so excited, since the Eagles just won last year!", "That happens sometimes. Maybe you should take a break", "cookeville", "Oh ok I see. Im sure he will want a nap later. Hopefully that gives you time to recharge a little.", "That must be hard.", "That is good, that is a nice way to make a bit of extra money!", "That's terrible.  I hope she's at least at peace now.", "I tried to do the mobile game but I didn't get it lol", "Hey that is nothing to sneeze at, I would take that in a heartbeat", "But you are all very close knit then?", "Yeah, kids are just so adorable, watching them learn in front of your eyes is an awesome privelege", "You'll do great. Your parents must really b proud.", "Hopefully she learns her lesson.", "Oh, I have hulu, I need to look into that!", "Oh. Well keep looking. You will find something soon.", "It happens really quickly. You forget everything then.", "Hey, that's pretty cool! I'm majoring in social work. Those both are close alternatives to social work that I gave some thought to. Sometimes I think I should have done criminology, but oh well. I hope you enjoy your semester.", "well thats a good start", "that is terrible, that is not a good way to keep people", "It was her who initiated the first move for us to split our ways. She said she was not feeling happy with me", "That is probably true, but the stories we hear do not help", "Yeah. It is difficult when you lose someone you're close to.", "It sure did, it was the best vacation I have ever been on", "Yeah, sometimes dads forget how young kids are and just do what they think is funny. My dad wasn't the best either at understanding how fragile kids can be. But he was still a good da", "Still, school is about making mistakes and learning from them", "I'd try not to be too down on myself over it.", "It's good, but I'm a little nervous for them. I know they'll be fine.", "of course", "Oh, yeah you should definitely cancel in that case", "Oh no!  I hope it didn't effect his team too much.", "those days will not ever come again, we have to live with it", "Oh, I am sorry to hear that!", "That is no fun, leave the kids at home for stuff like that!", "Oh cool - I haven't played all of them, but did playthe first one.", "That sounds like fun, which game platform?", "Wow those are not easy to learn either, good job raising them!", "oh that's bad.

I do not understand", "yeah me tooo. then how was your day today?", "4", "I hope you overcome that situation with the help of your friends", "I would tell them.. and if it happens a 2nd time then they arent very good friends to have! :/", "Hired the same day though...she must have done really well, despite being nervous!", "That is always a good feeling. I love when I am on top of things.", "I bet that warmed your heart. My old friends won't even drive across the city for me. We always meet downtown.", "Yeah, you should definitely bite the bullet (metaphorically).  It'll only get worse from here if you don't do anything, and it probably won't be as bad as you worry.", "Wonderful! What kind of instruments do they play?", "That's so nice to have someone to depend on.", "Its the worst. I would complain to management. You cant be the only one it happens to.", "Take your mind off of it and before you know it, you'll be filling out new hire paperwork!", "Well ... God is in the hands of your doctors", "Well, I hope you have a lot of fun in contact with nature", "You are not! I let my cats outside but supervised. Yes it's hard if they love it. You can get a special cat fence :)", "Sounds like you wanted to be the same as your cousin and not set apart.

Hard work is required to get something of value.", "She lived a long life for a cat but its never long enough for us who they leave behind. I hope you feel better soon...", "Yes it is. It makes me want to homeschool.", "Sometimes those things happen just when we need them. It would be nice if they happened for extra money too! lol", "That's true. I wish you the best of luck!", "We need good parents, that will make the world more human", "Maybe it will be just what you need though. Time to really concentrate and learn and grow within yourself as an individual :) Maybe you will have a nice romance too", "I takes a special kind of person to do what you are doing.

Congrats!", "Going isn't fun, but unfortunately it's necessary some times. I hope you feel better soon.", "really kind of you!", "Oh my god. You shouldn't just get over it- it is not right.

What do you feel about the music nowadays?", "ahh ... then you have to support it", "I always hate when work gets in the way of having friends. It's always one way or the other.

Not anymore!", "Oh no.  When will you have to talk to your boss?", "Yeah, it's very important to finish school so you don't have to work three jobs just to survive.", "I don't think they know where they're going. Probably just trying to get home.", "I understand where you're coming from. I would probably feel the same way in your shoes.", "That does sound pretty good.

I hope you get a breather from that.", "I bet it is. When things like that happen it makes you really value where you work. Makes it enjoyable.", "You all can still spend time together separately even if you can't all be together. Have to make it work.", "Still, that's still great. You better knock on some wood though, just in case. Don't jinx it!", "Three hours though. I don't think I would've made it.", "If only people were more considerate of others.

That's even worse! Did you puke a little? I would've thrown up!", "Always good to trust your spouse, but I would be on the fence a bit and have my eye out too.", "Yeah i would say the same to him too man.", "That's pretty cool", "wow that really is TOO young! Lets hope its nothing serious. He will get thru it regardless.", "I can tell!

I couldn't handle that. I'm claustrophobic. I'd freak out in a second. How long were you trapped for?", "You should have called the police.

It might be a harmless mole", "No kidding! That will be a memory that you will be unlikely to forget!", "Sounds like a nice upgrade.  Do you think you'll miss your old house at all?", "We all have those moments! Sometimes you just have to shake it out of your mind and take a deep breath.", "Wow! That's amazing!", "What types of encouragement was your friend saying to you?", "yeah that's true", "Well that's all the more reason that you shouldn't worry about it!

I'm sure that gave you quite a fright.", "It's swell to meet another player of the craft. Do you rake in the big bucks playing hold 'em?", "I probably would not chop his tree down.  You want to have the moral high ground.  But yes I would confront him", "Nice! I visited Spain not too long ago. I am positive you will have a blast.", "Anything from Mario Party to God of War. It's always fun with friends around for commentary lol", "I see, there are some jerks out there in this world.", "Good that you finally took control of the situation", "If you are prepared, then you will do fine.", "Yeah they feed off of his crazy I think.", "Congratulations to both her and you!

That's scary. I bet you won't let that happen again. Well, I'm glad everything ended up okay.", "You would think they would be motivated to keep their kids", "That's too bad. Maybe explore some other options and see how you feel.", "Sounds a lot like me. I love going through the toys and gadgets section to see if I can find anything for my kids.", "I never get gifts or a party. I need new friends and family", "Yup. Because as soon as you give him a sweet stack of cash, he's probably going to blow it at the slots.", "I disagree with both Democrats and Republicans.", "That just isn\u2019t right!", "Hopefully you will catch those great deals!  Sounds exciting!", "I bet you are so proud. I cried when my daughter graduated 6th grade lol", "Oh I see now. Wow that is pretty lucky!", "That's great you got him up to a healthy weight!  Kudos on you!  I'm sure those spots will even out eventually.", "That's good!", "Yeah, there's always that fury of activity by everyone to go stock up on gas, groceries, and other materials like batteries, etc. So, did it ultimately end up hitting you, or no?", "You sound like an amazing father.  He is so lucky!", "Really? I will definitely give it a try. My favorite tv show is stranger things", "Three dollars?", "I am glad for you. Sometimes kids can be annoying.", "Is he feeling better?", "That's cool. I buy the box of six and don't share with anyone", "WOW", "That seems pretty gross, especially the possums.", "That's really nice. Been thinking about proposing to my girlfriend as well. We've been together for almost the same amount of time.", "Oh awesome! Oh my gosh they do. I can't believe mine are in their 20's now! I hate it when they grow up honestly", "Yeah I can relate.  I bet you feel and look amazing!  That determination is a quality to behold.  Keep working hard!", "Oh that's terrible.", "I always hide my sweet whenever I buy any", "That is a fair point. You can't have those that are there to protect us be distracted.

Those are always tricky. I hope you guys can work through it amicably, because that's obviously an important relationship.", "Thats sweet though", "Well did you get your money back?", "It will get better. I know that is a tough thing.", "Hey at least it is still a car, don't feel bad.", "I hope you eventually made friends! I know how much it stinks to feel left out of everything", "Thank goodness nothing flooded then", "Have you tried?", "Maybe not lol", "Yeah, mentally ill people shouldn't even be allowed to have dogs. There should be a screening process.", "Be careful! You can puncture your stomach like that and not make it. It happens to those with bulemia all the time. Stay safe!", "I am sure you knocked that test out of the park - sweat or not.", "That sounds like a great plan!", "That sounds like a really good idea to do.", "Psychology made me sleepy lol", "Of course lol", "Well you should cherish them and let them know how you feel.", "wow you are a brave soul", "They should be pretty good", "Fall is a wonderful time to have it. Are you going to be the best man?", "Netflix is always nice", "That's pretty cool. I don't see my friends much since I moved.", "I absolutely agree", "Woo hoo! That would be so awesome!", "oh thats cool", "I know. The customer is always right! Or so they teach us.", "Good luck.", "It's like that feeling when you hit a bump on the road but 100x worse!", "Porches are pretty nice. Not nice as Ford sedans, though.", "That's good to hear. Just don't forget that bug spray!", "24 burritos, my god. You are a eating terminator!", "Hillbillies love that stuff! They love roadkill hahaha", "I guess you shouldn't clean the poop off your shoe then. Save it for when the time comes.", "What was his first word?", "I love money too. Are you planning on spending it on anything once you get those fat stacks?", "Work is always miserable for me.", "dont let her control you!", "Are the children having fun with each other?", "That is great of you", "Just don't get too addicted and turn into a degenerate gambler!", "good luck with that, i hope it works out!", "How long you been together?", "Yeah, seems like all tv shows are like that. My favorite is the Teletubbies.", "It's hard not to! We get used to all the nice things we have", "Me too, you are not alone. It's a very common problem", "thats what matters", "I do too honestly", "If we had a better public transportation system where I live, I'd probably choose that over cars.", "thats usually when it happens", "And beer.. There has to be beer.", "I did when I was a kid. Her name was Terror. she was nice though", "haha.  Murder documentaries are my favorite too.", "That is an awesome outlook on life.  It is important to be content with what you have.", "Those are some great qualities to have, that's for sure.", "I had plans today, but they got canceled. I wasn't too upset haha", "Sounds like a very stressful time for you. I hope everything turns out well and wish you the best of luck", "And you never have a fly-swatter when you need one. Like, who keeps one of those around? Although I always have flip-flops because I live near the coast, so that makes a decent fly-swatter.", "OH no. Im sorry I laughed then.", "Ah, the kids. Well, maybe that's a good excuse for them to skip the sugar for a few days. I'm sure you'll make it up to them anyhow.", "Nice, it all starts with determination first. I believe in you man!", "Tell her its okay", "Dang. It's so hot, swimming seems to be the only way to beat the heat.", "Im like that with food too", "That is so gross, tell them to clean up after themselves?", "Oh wow. What kind of job did you pick up?", "I think the chat is messing up. I saw something about someone being in the hospital sorry. First words are awesome", "Haha that is awesome.", "I guess try and forget about it", "I guess that's understandable then. I doubt it was personal.", "That's great! Did you catch up or go do fun things together, perhaps both?", "sounds great", "thats what im talking about!", "it must be nice to live in such a beautiful place", "thats cool", "They have 4 other stars", "Well that's good. I wouldnt trust my neighbor with my ice cube tray", "Do you not like your room mate?", "oh thats good", "Okay then now I understand  why you are happy.", "You are so lucky. Treasure them! Forgive easily :)", "I commend you for admitting your fault in it", "Was it his first offense?", "You will feel better tomorrow", "Congratulations!  What a wonderful surprise!", "Yes! You will feel so much better afterwards", "That's not their choice though.", "That's not good. Why is she refusing?", "Cool.  What kind of memories does it remind you of back in the day?", "What is a pallbearer??", "Oh. I am very sorry to hear that. Did your parents buy it for him?", "I hope one day to have great seats like that.", "Dont be so hard on yourseld", "What movie was it?", "aww, sorry to hear that. Dont worry, everything will be fine soon.", "Are they okay now?", "Oh, that? That's big deal. Everyone has done that at least once. You're definitely overthinking it. People make mistakes. What kind of candy bar was it?", "I often times wish I didn't have any family and friends, would make things easier.", "I know that feeling of getting used. I hope we both find solice", "Well that escalated quickyl", "Perhaps talking to your doctor would be a good idea?", "Awe! They are so cute at that age. I have a granddaughter that is 6 month old.", "That is good to hear", "Be glad of who you are as well", "Wow, that's a long time ago", "Yikes.  Sorry you had to go through that.

LOL", "hopefully things get better for you", "Is that your favorite kind of cake?", "That must have been a terrible situation.", "Wow, that's pretty young for an elder. She is in a better place now", "I bet it was fun to see that", "Make a point to do it even if you don't think you want to.  you will never regret it", "I just hate rejection and it's so awful. Like why do I even try", "oh that stinks...", "Very true.  Somebody has to win!", "Why do I not believe you haha", "You can do it! I have faith in you!", "I say just let it go and eat what you want bro. it's just weight.", "I feel you, it's hard to trust people again", "I don't know why some people have kids!", "The world needs more people willing to help others.", "Ah, gotcha. I hope it works out for him and you", "thats cool", "Oh wow! How nerve wrecking!", "I hear that!", "That is very good of you to stay faithful.", "I understand although everyone needs some alone time too.", "That is a relief, that is one of my biggest fears", "i can imagine", "Was he supposed to sign with another team?", "I know.  I am so sorry that you had to go through that.", "I love being an aunt! I get to spoil other people's kids!", "Lol", "you got the right idea", "Times are tough", "I'm confident everything will be fine.", "That's not very nice of them at all. Are you ok?", "Try smoking weed? It's a lot better than chemotherapy", "Oh wow! I thought it didn't start until fall.

Allow yourself to indulge every so often.", "What did you do while they are gone?", "Yikes.  How are you today?", "Do you stay in touch?", "Do you have any plans for this upcoming weekend?", "I hope everything turns out good for you two!", "Are the cowboys your favorite team? I prefer watching college.", "Yes, that one is very scary", "I'm glad you're being enthusiastic.", "I assume you were trying to be a good friend and protect them?", "Where did you go after you left?", "I need to google that. Is it a big SUV?", "I have never heard of that game. I bet it will be fun though.", "Wow, does she sell them anywhere?", "Yeah I do to. Does he plan on losing weight?", "Me too, he's so real.

Good luck with everything!", "I wish I was a good driver!", "I bet place that is so big you can't go through it all in one day", "I understand that.

Keep your head up!  Fake it til you  make it LOL", "You are lucky to still have that.", "That's so cool, maybe one day you can save enough for you rown.", "I can imagine that being a bit lonely.", "That is good to hear that it doesn't happen anymore.", "sorry, i hope they apologized for that", "am sorry, maybe you should wait until they are restocked", "I'm glad everything worked out.", "I am so sorry ab out that I hope things get better soon", "That is too bad.

Is your insurance going to be able to cover the damage?", "That's quite unfortunate. I feel for you as I used to live in a small town where jobs were scarce. It's rough when there is no competition", "Oh that's never fun. I hate that too.", "I trust you did well too", "Aww I am sorry to hear that. I hope you can regain contact with them someday. I'm sure they'd love to hear from you.", "Oh maybe you should try joining  achurch.", "I used to love riding my bike around the block", "What kind was it?", "That is very kind. I'm honestly doubt that my grandma even knows what a printer is.", "sorry about that, seems their customer service is not welcoming", "I hope he does, for his sake. But I imagine he will come around", "Then talk to someone that he respects maybe they will talk senses into his head", "That's good. The first step towards turning new is to resolve and take action.", "Having proof is awesome, otherwise it would make your case a hard one to prove.", "Are they going to pay you back for it?", "thats great. They now have confidence in you", "If you know where you're going then you should be", "Did they brought any special gift?", "I'm glad you understand that now.", "I'm sure, I'd be the same way too!", "Do you have anything you want to see there?", "That is interesting", "I think the reason is because we want to know if they would fit or not or if we made a mistake or not, that's how it is when it's not bought from a physical store", "I wonder if he was self motivated", "That's right! It will all pay off for you in a few years.", "Ah yes, I know that feeling. Sitting in traffic is a major drag. I find that music or podcasts help it go by quicker", "You should go to reddit.com/r/eyebleach.  There's nothing there but cute and nice things to look at.  It will ease your soul.", "They're supposed to either do that for you or get someone else to", "I understand. It is difficult to have everyone staring at you", "Great! I wish I loved my job and work environment as much as you do", "I will just think they are happily watching down over us and try to go on one day at a time.", "Oh that is freaking awesome!  Congrats!  How are you going to treat yourself??", "Too bad, oh well, if things turn around in her status, you have someone in her that you can consider", "Whoa, that's quite a walk! I hope that doesn't happen. Do you have anyone to call for help?", "Who can blame you? We are taught to trust professionals.", "What color are you shooting for?", "Congratulations, I'm sure it will be a good PC.", "Aw, well that's good that it did. I'm sure she wanted it to be!", "Then what caused you to fire her?", "yah, or get a comedy or get to watch a movie", "Excellent!  Those thoughts are beautiful.  Have a good day :)", "Nice! It will be a good time to relax and enjoy the beach and nightlife!", "It's definitely different than what I was used to. It's crazy how fast technology upgrades. Sometimes I feel like a caveman.", "Just be patient and everything will fall into place.", "You'll be fine! Having hope is the best you can do", "Ok. I understand", "That's great, I hope you weren't hurt!", "Do you remember the title?  Maybe you can get another copy.", "I'll bet. It's always nice to see someone who can bring back good memories.", "Oh, no, I'm sorry to hear that. You had no idea that would be the last visit, but I can understand how you would feel that way. I have no doubt she understood why you didn't though.", "That's a good idea. What restaurant were you thinkin?", "You'll do great! That's right up your alley.", "Ew, that's gross. Some people have no sense of decency.", "It's good to get noticed for that.  most of the time you only get attenton for messing up!", "Nice! So you've had a good experience with that brand?", "That sounds awesome, honestly. I hope you enjoy it!", "That's pretty rough.  Were her last years happy, at least?", "If it's a personal matter, I would definitely take the issue over to human resources. It's better to stand up for yourself.", "As you should be. I wish I liked to swim.", "Well, I hope they've figured it out together during this time.", "Are you going to wear it or put it up for safe keeping?", "Awesome! Congratulations! It is always nice to accomplish something like that.", "I understand. Those thing happened from time to time.", "Wow, that is really thoughtful.", "Do you have any proof? If so you should bring it up to her.", "I am sure there is a special friend that can help you with that amount and when you have you can repay them back", "The meaningfulness is definitely something you can never replace. I hope that it shows up, and if not, I hope this watch brings meaning to your life in new ways.", "These days that is a great gift, am I right?", "Multiplayer games can be fun, but that's certainly a downfall to them!", "I see. Well it's an honest mistake. I've done different socks before", "I understand how you feel, I used to have one like that, when It passed away, I got a puppy of the same exact breed and gave it the same name. with a few month, It looked like the one that passed away so It helped me to forget", "Did you?", "Well, I would probably feel the same way, but I'm sure you will be great. If they didn't have confidence in your abilities, they wouldn't have chosen you to do it!", "Customer service is very important, and it seems like that place needs to work on that.", "That's good ,a speed recovery I must say.I commend the opticians", "I think in situations like this, you can take someone that knows about cars along", "What is his name?", "How inconvenient! Are you going to take it to a technician?", "There is a lot of that type of behavior now. It's like people have lost their minds.", "I love chocolate cake! You'll have to save me some.", "Yes, using social media really helps us connect with friends and family so much better.", "I don't blame you. I try to keep tabs on them because I don't trust they will be delivered in time. I also set up a camera to catch deliveries that don't deliver :}", "How are you going to celebrate?", "My sister is recently going through the exact same thing. It was frustrating for her for a while, but things are looking up for her! I'm sure they will for you as well.", "Nice reminiscent", "Oh no, that is sad news indeed. I am sorry to hear that.", "I'm sure she really wanted to go. Sometimes we have to make choices we don't like. My offer still stands.", "I love looking at old photos, both happy and sad moments.", "Wow, that must've been really spoooky.", "not for the time", "You must've worked hard to get there", "So how did you handle it?", "Congratulations. You must have the gods smiling on you", "I bet, those sound like awesome presents!", "I hope she has forgiven you then", "That was very sweet and thoughtful too. Glad you're better!", "Yea, benefits and pay seem to be the common motivators. I'm glad it worked out so well for you!", "Think about the positive aspects of this, you are moving forward", "That sucks, hopefully nothing you can't replace. I'd suggest getting some help if your drinking has become distructive.", "I see. lol. I hate cats, sorry", "Well ,you played hard! But did you work hard?", "Tell me all about it", "yes, my patner is very important relationship.", "sorry, those horror movies can scare you to death.", "Oh ok, I understand. Well, I have this girl that I have been wanting to date. I want to ask her to be my girlfriend this weekend", "Where do you go to school?", "Wow, that's a food challenge type of thing! Did they get anything out of it?", "I'm glad you really enjoyed it!", "That's a weird term to use", "Well, I'm glad no one was hurt at least. :)", "It can be stressful sometimes. I am glad to hear you found something good.", "Yes it is.. thats great that their love has lasted so long.", "I do not. I am still pretty young so I'd like to wait a few more years. I don't think I'm quite ready", "oh ok I understand", "Oh my. But why do you care if they're your cousin..", "So what did you do ?", "I am glad you are. A good career is essential to live a healthy life.", "OH I'm so jealous! Have lots of fun!", "Im glad.. it seems like we both are getting the vacations we need!", "Sounds like you are doing great. Those are among the best things in life.", "your parents must be really proud of you", "Luckily it will heal soon and you can feel back to normal.", "thats super nice, thanks for sharing.", "That's nuts! I would have been so scared", "Little ones love rockers or swings, did you have a good time watching your cousin?", "That's quite harsh for getting one bad grade. You should encourage him to do well without being so rash.", "Oh, that is not good. You should have done better!", "You should get your mind ready for the worst if he does not take it too well", "Thats so cool..  I live in Orlando.. I'll wave to you guys!", "Luckily the phone didn't fall and crack the glass! Those phone covers aren't the best.", "yea i 100% agree with that.", "Well I hope you do good either way.", "Oh maybe next time!", "Oh, that's too bad.  Well then I hope you can find happiness again in the future.  Good luck to you!", "I see. That was nice of you to repay your friend with the meal.", "yea the cgi in movies is stellar.", "Why don't you talk to yours?  Im so sorry!", "Incredible, kick him out of the house!", "Ah, I see. Well I hope you figure it out soon. You need a way to get around town!", "I shall :) I need to make myself get out more. It would be good for me", "oh ok, I understand", "That would be pretty shocking overall! I hope you're able to move on from this somehow.", "yea all of the nostalgia can do that.", "I bet it can. I had no friends in college either.", "That's like the toughest job out there.", "That's great. Good for you, bud.", "Aw well that seems like it would be a great time! I hear the beaches are beautiful.", "You should tell your wife to clear your guilt.", "Did she know that  you crushed on him?", "well thats a relief.", "I bet it was, college is such a great time.", "As long as you did your best, I say have no regrets. You made the most of a bad situation.", "I'll cross my fingers alongside you. It sounds like you deserve it!", "I'm sorry to hear that.  I hope you don't dwell on it too much and can be happy in the future.", "That's awesome! I really want to go paragliding someday.", "Its okay, hopefully it was not too expensive1", "I've heard that as well. I'm male I know I was much closer to my mom.", "He will turn out to be a great man", "yea that would help clear you concision", "I think you should have talked to the hostel management to help you out on this as well", "I see.

There is nothing you can do now.", "Yes, but they can be a bit of a challenge when they are growing up!", "lol well as long as you're fairly active and fit it shouldn't be too big of a problem.", "I see than, I could tell you that you should just overcome yourself and do it, but its you own personal business...", "I could imagine. I hope you're able to work through this somehow.", "Hmm I think you should make it up to her somehow. Take her to an expensive dinner.", "What an impostor.", "Well I wish luck to both of you.", "Seems like you took all the precautions, the rest is not up to you.", "All you can do is just keep doing the best job you can and hopefully someone will notice someday.", "I guess so but it should be able to alleviate a lot of that loneliness.", "I'm having a boy soon. 3 months or so", "he will be okay as long he got the tratment", "Thats great.

I am sure it will work out for you!", "Makes you appreciate life more, doesn't it.", "Is it open 24 hours a day?", "it's terrible to lose someone. Was this expected or sudden?", "just gotta be careful where you swim", "Oh wow! What a blessing!", "I know that's gonna to be a terrible loss for the family.", "Are you going to buy him a new one?", "That must really disappointing. Will you race again?", "thats cool. what does he do for a living?", "Yikes that's a little crazy.   Are they cat collectors?", "That's a relief then! Hope it's still delicious!", "im really glad to hear it got worked out", "Yeah, I guess they need to be agile to escape all the neighborhood cats!", "You must be disappointed. I'm sorry.", "I'm inclined to agree with you.  That's kinda strange.  The guy's ok with it?", "Must've been really nostalgic. Did you guys catch up on your lives now?", "haha me too, never met a cake i didn't like.", "Yummmy!  That sounds amazing!  I am sure you will have fun!", "Better to be over prepared than under.", "can you call them on their cell?", "That's almost a little strange.  Do you still have any interest in her?", "Oh now you're just making me hungry!", "Rightly so!  Nothing worse than expecting something and then it not being there!", "That's really sweet! Maybe they miss you, too.", "Dogs are a good source of entertainment.", "oh yes that's true.  i thought you might have dated later in life.", "Oh so you're both hunters!", "I know, right.  Its kind of annoying but, also kind of nice.", "So you guys never did visits or anything?", "Must feel terrible. Well, at least, you don't have to look after them then.", "mutts are the most loveable.", "hachi.  best dog movie ever.", "That's cool. Do you have everything planned out?", "I think I wouldn't go outside in close to 100 degree weather. That's crazy.", "That's fabulous.  Love it when the older generation teaches the younger ones.", "Yeah, a lot of the times it would just come back as fast as it got lost", "They're trying to not pay if they don't have too.    more $ in their bank.", "That was so nice that your were chosen to get it and hopefully pass it on again!", "Looks like the future is bright for him", "Cool, where do you get your venison from?", "Cool, you guys can race and whoever loses gets a new one", "Wow, she is a little weird.", "It definitely does.  You shouldn't have to stress about your job", "For sure, they can teach us a lot", "Ah, I miss naps. If only I could go back to Kindergarten.", "Did you put the cat in time out?", "Oh no!  Are you alright?", "That will be a very nice reunion.", "Canada is such a beautiful country. Was there a lot of things to do there for you kids?", "Wow. Good luck. I hope you get the position.", "What game did you play?", "I know! I think my wife is calling it quits after the 38th, though.", "That's good! Hopefully you'll be compensated in some way for the fries.  Ugh, cold fries!  You're way nicer about it than I would have been.", "Ah, a must in a household of rugrats.", "Oh my word! I thought bobcats were mythical like unicorns.", "That's crazy!", "You sound prepared!  I am sure you will make a good impression on the other party goers!", "I guess you are right", "Sweet! What are you going to be doing there? Always wanted to take a journey to the South.", "Your kid should be on America's got Talent! unless you're not in america.", "That's pretty neat! I work in a Nike sweatshop in Siberia, so I really can't say the same!", "Well good luck. I think you'll do well if you studied that hard.", "Yeah, being alone a big ole house is often times more spooky than not. I almost got nabbed by a ghost the last time I was alone.", "Bless it!  And you survived all of that to tell the tale!  And all of this over a busted garbage bag!  We gotta get you a better brand of garbage bags, friend.  :)", "It is tough.  Don't be too hard on yourself.  Just do better moving forward", "That's so true. I was scared to put my kids in daycare", "Yes that would be nice.", "Awe a little sentimental?", "That\u2019s great and a relief", "I definitely know that feeling lol", "That's not bad. I only see people in my family once ever few years.", "That is great that you are prepared!", "I do have a few really good ones.", "Sounds like a plan!  that's the only way you'll get better!", "Enjoy it before you get old. Before you know it college will be over and you will be a slave to student loan payments.", "That's sweet.", "Man that is pretty crazy being that young even.", "It could always be worse. People in the 3rd world are on the edge of death from having no food.", "It is ok. If the teacher was not angry, it should be fine.", "We have cold winters but hardly ever any snow. I'm glad too", "Perhaps he thought the same about you?", "Sounds like what kids would do!  But the bright side is, if you have two days worth of fall or winter, she's prepared!", "That isn't half as bad as what I was thinking it might be.  Glad to hear it was just overindulging in food.  Oh well, you always have tomorrow to be better!", "That is awesome. You should marry her again lol", "Are you gonna try to keep that sort of balance going forward?", "Give them to a homeless person.", "I hope so too!", "That is so terrible.  It would be nice if the refrigerator company had to replace all of your groceries if their product breaks!  Did you get a new one yet?", "Just hope for a happy healthy baby!", "Be very careful. It was just an untreated UTI in me and then they wouldn't help me when I had HELLP syndrome for awhile..I went to a few doctors too..none were good-and I was full term..I almost bled out..The littlest things sometimes can really hurt you and your baby. I am so sorry! I am so glad you had 1, take good care of yourself and follow your gut :)", "lol, oh no!  My albino rabbit I had when I was younger was like that....skittish beyond belief!  Those are adorable names!", "On the one hand I miss them because there's nothing in the world like baby smell.  On the other, the best day of my life so far was when my youngest was potty-trained!", "I've never seen a bunny. That;s weird", "Well think about what qualities he has- There are so many dishonest people out there and abusive people. Sometimes we don't connect with someone good..but will regret it later. Definitely think on it as you'd never want to lose a good trustworthy person even if you just keep them as a friend", "Never bad, good mom or dad :) They are only young once", "People let things get out of hand and it is so unecessary.", "Oh how disappointing.", "I feel that way when my kids are gone", "Yeah, but the state would never get out of debt if they had to pay the people for missing work just to wait in inefficient lines at the DMV.", "That's hard! If he was bad to you, I hope you are able to get over it, if not, you can always reach out :)", "you have to let those people go", "I wouldn't either. She should find another job lol", "Dang. Well I bet that really worked to get your point across haha", "Ha ha.  Now I know you're kidding me.  50 years?  I think you served your time for that offense, wiouldn't you say?", "Sounds like a grand ole time. Everyone likes the good ole carriage ride every now and again.", "We believe it and you just might", "That's no good. How does that happen?", "Some people make it to the other side. I'm glad ou did.", "I bet, it can help people and pay a lot in a career as well. Good luck!", "I'm no doctor, but it sounds like you might need even more to balance things out.", "Well, if that's how you feel then maybe it is best if you stay in the dugout and don't play the field. No shame in that.", "Well that was very nice of her. Did you give her anything in return?", "That's sweet. You should've took a picture and framed it so you guys can cherish that moment forever", "That is exactly how I would describe my grandma.  YOu are lucky to have had her", "Yes, Now days, most neighbors don't talk to each other.", "That's definitely a good sign!", "Yeah, ignorance in youthfulness is sometimes a good thing. That's really terrible of your ex, though. He should be burned at the stake.", "And you could have caught him in the closet!!!", "That would be.  I am so sorry you had to go through that.", "Its good that they are thoughtful, sound like very well mannered kids!!!", "Are you taking some orange slices to spice things up?", "If you could do it all over again, how would you overcome , and pardon me for saying this, your wimpy-ness?", "That is great", "Nice. The Office is one of my favorite shows. I do enjoy Steve Carrell's character.", "That's fair enough.  I wouldn't know what to do with a hurt bird.", "Good. There was no else that could replace the person sick?", "Sounds great. You are lucky to have such thoughtful coworkers.", "What are you going to do?", "That's pretty neat. I imagine is very nice working from home. I wish I could so that I can stop working at the Nike sweatshop.", "Well, that's good. At least everything turned out okay in the end.", "That is very awesome", "Did you ride any that made you sick? Some of the ones that go upside down always make me sick. haha.", "I am sure they learned from you", "Indeed. The world can use a lot less people.", "That is terrible.  WHy?", "Wow. I bet you are grateful to be working. Being jobless is a horrible place to be.", "That is great to hear", "I just think that's the worst way for the IRS to do things though. Life is hard and once you have debt from any numbers of things, it can be hard to climb back out of the red.  I'm so sorry you had that shock and I hope they work with you on payments.", "With all the extra time you have you should start a counseling service.  I know your mom would use you!", "I do love getting gifts", "That's cool man. I'm really not close to any of my relatives.", "Wow! I bet that is scary. Good to know you made it okay.", "what did they advise you to do?", "You definitely will", "That's cool. Who collected the most eggs?", "What band was it?", "Good, thats what needed to happen", "I can understand that", "yea i think we have all been there", "I am sure you are", "What was wrong with your Dad?", "Well, that's a wonderful thing.  You had a good time with the first one and this new one will breathe life into your day and pull any sadness away.  What will you name it?", "Well that is too bad.  Maybe there is some way you can motivate him to work harder.", "i hope it turns out well for you!", "of course you were", "You should enter a eating contest. Sounds like you could win.", "Yeah, that's how it was with my younger brother too. He always go his way.", "That would scare me too", "oh sorry to hear that", "I think you are overreacting. Just try to find your medicine and calm yourself down. I am sure you will get the job.", "Eww.. Rotten eggs.. That's terrible. I know eggs are so healthy for you, but I never touch them partly because of how they smell when they're cooked/prepared in certain ways. Again, I'm sorry you had to deal with that. Was there anybody nice enough to help you when you were on the bus, or how did that end up?", "That is really something to be proud of", "Maybe he is just busy right now. I wouldn't lose hope yet.", "That is nice.", "You're not good at a single one of those? I was a strong swimmer when I was a kid.", "the NICU thats wonderful", "My mom had a husky named Heidi for almost 16 years.  They are beautiful dogs but boy can they run away fast if they get an opportunity.", "Please do. Sometimes it takes time to mature on an emotional level. It's cool that you have that on them :-)", "That's really cool. Where is the date going to be at?", "I am with you", "that is awesome", "I bet. Maybe he will move closer to you soon.", "I always had trouble with math so anything above counting is beyond what I feel competent in.  Good luck on the test!", "Oh, I am sorry for being so insensitive. I am sure your mother is in a better place.", "What? Nothing too bad I guess...", "hellz yea.. all about number 1", "I'm sure it won't be too bad. You just have to work hard and hopefully you'll get promoted next time.", "Ha ha! Awesome!  I bet you're great at it!  Get out a hose and just water them down! Its faster.  Hope you have a great game tomorrow!  Don't forget the orange slices.", "I understand. I hope things will go smoothly.", "That is good.  You will feel better", "I am so sorry to hear that. I wish there was something more you could do.", "People can be bad some time. I hope it will be better.", "well at least you made it through", "yea after the finals, at least he didnt go to the GSW haha", "That's pretty cool. Do you think you will get the job?", "That is so good for the soul", "Wow, I bet that was a happy surprise. I love looking at old pictures.", "I am sorry you have to deal with that.", "hah .. it gets better", "What did you do all by yourself?", "It's just an extra tomato, man. You're going to let that ruin your relationship with your turtle?", "Can't go wrong the sushi and steak special. A classic in Alaska.", "Interesting. Why wouldn't they take you along?", "thats good", "It will take time, but I'm sure you'll be okay.", "She sounds smart.  Are you nervous at all or just thrilled to be with her again?", "That pool noodle must be terrifying for her.", "That's somewhat offensive.", "I will. But I dont scare easily.", "Have you ever tried writing? That's what I do", "Oh, so you're hosting. Man, that's definitely hard. I really do feel for you, as I wouldn't have the courage to do that. Well, since you're worried about it, at least it shows you care. And you still have plenty of time to prepare! Do you have anyone that can help?", "It is a good sign that she shows that kind of care to them", "ah thats understandable", "Did you try calling your local shelter?", "Wow. That's some friends you have there.", "I am sure they will. They have to if they want to get a good grade.", "That's good to hear. Glad you're ok.", "I do miss some of my class", "oh that sounds great. good luck", "Im so sorry.. I wish I could fix that for you.", "Oh no! Well those aren't such good friends.", "Yeah, that diet is somewhat expensive. Has it been hard sticking to it?", "How were the rest of your exams?", "I am sure you will find something", "Not your fault at all! Somethings can't be helped.", "It has to be tough to not know what to eat. I hope you'll get that allergy test soon to figure things out.", "I would not like that at all", "Thats nice this time of year..", "It really is. I found being positive is key and you're probably more helpful than you realize. Even though you feel it's not exactly right, doesn't hurt to ask too.", "thats a good selection", "I hope the lakers treats him well.", "I just might  you never know these days!", "You're very modest!", "I did attend college, but I am one of those statistics you hear about....a dropout.", "Ah.. so it's that kind of situation. Yeah, it can be one thing if it's just something where kids are acting like kids, and you can't physically intervene in time. But it's another if you think it's neglect and that they're not responding appropriately to the situation. I would trust your judgment. I hope everything ends well with it though! I'm sure you gave your child lots of love afterward.", "true! Life is full of learning, I am glad you have learned something from it, so many don't. Kudos!", "That does sound scary", "Oh wow. She sounds like super woman!", "I got a clown for my daughters 4 birthday. Every single kids cried lol", "Well then it's no loss! Find family in others. That is no family!", "Maybe you should get cameras", "every few years.. and its enough!", "Well, that was nice of you. I'm glad you got a chance to squeeze in more family time and didn't go spend it just sitting around or something. I hope that happens more often for you.", "I hope you win too!  Scratch them now and let me know if you win.  Now I'm excited for you! Hope you hit a big bank!", "well don't worry too much ... the food isnt the most important thing and I am sure it will at least be satisfactory.  Focus on the family", "I am sorry, that sounds terrible", "I am so sorry to hear that. His memory lives on though.", "I would blast them on social media. That is not good, especially for them not to take responsibility for it.", "I actually got a vacuum myself but made a bad decision. The thing does not suck well.", "I love boxers, and their cut off tails.", "Who knew a diaper would be so terrifying.", "I hope it's a better experience by the pier than mine.  hahahaha.", "It's better to write things down than try to keep things in your head.", "We have a lot of those where I live.", "Oh geez! lol! Just watch tv online :) I do- that way always something I like, I can watch", "I wish I could make a cheescake.", "News clothes are always nice", "Where do you live?  Kansas?", "he lived? Oh no. What happened?!", "good luck next time!", "Cherish every moment, they grow up SO fast!", "I am right there with you.  I hope this is a sign of a great week to come!", "Were the opposing team a really tough one?", "I bet you will", "I bet he hated missing it too! Work is good for bills but it interferes a lot with life", "I would be too", "You should talk to your friend about it.", "What a wonderful nostalgic piece.  My daughter is 8 and growing up way too fast.  I have a hand print ornament she made and I can't believe one day she'll be 13!", "History is one my favorites as well!", "Well at least they got out", "I guess you'll have to get a storage unit.  The question then is what goes in the storage unit?  Furniture or the kids crafts.  Haha.", "That happens to me too. I go to the store almost every day", "That makes sense. Did you have fun?", "Well as long as they love it", "That sounds great!", "I am sure you guys have a great bond and many fun memories.", "Was the cat nice? I know they can be sassy when they don't get all of the attention lol", "I guess, but they can always teach them", "That's great when someone you love puts in the extra effort to be there for you", "Yes, I hope she can find her self worth in who she is. It's just part of growing up. It's hard", "Thats so sweet of you.", "How did it go? Is it college?", "I will not either", "Yeah, I can totally understand that. It can be exhilarating and a different experience, I would imagine. But I would understand that you wouldn't want to have to deal with the after effects. I never have trouble with nightmares, so I don't worry about that. As for me, I'm still on the fence about ghosts.", "That must be really difficult and lonely for you. I hope you guys can get something figured out.", "That's great! How old is he?", "that is really nice of you", "If they know you, they should know better.", "I did not expect that kind of reaction! But I guess I don't know enough about possums. Maybe that makes sense. I compare them almost to raccoons, who I've seen be very aggressive. Well, it looks you made a new friend. I hope you named them!", "I know exactly what you mean. Someone returned my purse at the casino once. It still had my money in it!", "Wow.. That's almost noble. I hope you're able to still properly survive without it, especially since it's unfair that you're not getting it in the first place. I'm sorry you're being put in that position. One day I'm sure your children will recognize and appreciate you had to go through for them.", "I'm in college I understand. Just have to keep pushing forward and you'll so great", "Seriously!  I just keep thinking that they are a person just like me and it doesn't always means they are better than me just because they are entitled.  As they say, everyone puts their pants on one leg at a time.", "I would too! Most officers dont show up for that.", "Maybe you should go on a trip together", "Haha, that's incredible. A lot of parents wouldn't feel that way... After 18, they're done. That's pretty cool of you to feel that way, but I guess that speaks volumes about the kind of kids you have and how good they are. It sounds like you raised them right.", "I can understand that", "What kind of birthday are you having?", "That is something that is a dream! Enjoy it so much! congrats", "That is so sad to hear.  I hope things go well with the therapy and you are reunited soon.", "Those are great names! And that does sound like a good idea, as long as you're comfortable with it. It's such a tenuous situation.. to want another pet to fill the void, but to be scared that you will be disappointed when they don't live up to their predecessors. My girlfriend will be in the same situation when her dog passes. She's already getting nervous since her dog is 10-years-old.", "EW!  I might start sleeping with ear plugs in now too.  I've heard you eat 8 spiders on average in a lifetime, some in your sleep.  So many things to be scared of with bugs! I'm so glad they were able to get it out.  Tell her I hope she gets over the trauma of it okay.", "Oh my god! I have done something similar before. I don't get embarrassed easy but I know such things do sting a bit!", "Police here do that sometimes. It sucks.", "When did you start living by yourself?", "What kind of job is it?", "Well thats what I mean. I hate when people take advantage of others", "It's all behind you now.", "I actually had some move in a couple of days ago. I have figured them out yet lol", "Have you been busy lately?", "I wonder what my old school looks like now", "You should check if they raised your rates unexpectedly or maybe something you bought is eating up a lot of electricity.", "I hope he learned his lesson.", "What did you order?", "Remember to cherish them as we can all go at any minute :)", "A Hoover seems like a reliable choice. My girlfriend is a neat freak, and decided to go with a big purchase, a Dyson, which is more expensive. I've used it and it's not bad. Still not sure I'd pay as much as she did for a vacuum cleaner, but who am I to argue. Anyway, I'm happy for you.", "Well, that's understandable.  I've had two kids of my own and labor would not be fun in the car.  Was she in shock when you guys were almost hit?", "You will likely never hear about any of this stuff in a doctors office, but it can heal almost anything!  I hope your son is better before the end of summer.  Keep hope alive!", "That sucks.", "Sorry! I meant that kids do that, enjoy it mom while they are little :)", "Yea, they're his parents. I can imagine everyone being hesitant about telling them what not to do with their own child.", "That's a good way to look at it, to use them as motivation and a goal to strive for. Are you in school yourself, or just working?", "Well, there you go.  She enjoyed it and if she didn't complain or scoff at you, then she sounds like a keeper!", "Oh you have kids, too? They're going to be so happy!", "I bet its fun. I cant swim though", "Are you thinking about telling her you don't want to see it?", "That is very thoughtful of you.", "Wow. Im sorry", "That's true. It's nice of you to put yourself in their shoes.", "Yeah, I guess it depends on your household. I just tag along with my parents from time to time to get certain things in bulk. But I think you need to have a certain amount of people in your family for it to be worth the membership. Still, I really appreciate the business and the owner as a whole.", "What?!! That's terrible.  I don't understand how people don't take care of things that don't belong to them when its a privilege to use borrowed things.", "I hate that happened to you. I know the feeling too. Someone stole my car from the work parking lot once. I had just soent over 1500 getting things fixed on it.", "It is rarely easy to know the right thing to do in these sorts of situations.  This might be a situation that calls for some professional help.", "That's pretty cool! I hope everything goes well with the training and raising of it. Your wife sounds really cool to do that for you.", "I'm glad you're going to talk about it instead of being passive aggressive about it.", "Sometimes it means increased work commute, or higher costs of living. But sometimes that can be worth it in terms of the health benefits and lifestyle improvements that come along with it. It's all a balance. I'm glad you seem to have found yours!", "It will save you a lot of money too", "Hope you find something you like.", "Lids today are so picky about everything. Its sort of strange. Its nothing like when I was growing up", "Oh man... When you consider all that, then yeah, definitely cut ties. If they did that to me more than twice, then I would realize really quick that they weren't the type to depend on or waste time on. I feel sorry for you. People should have friends that recognize their worth and be able to respect that relationship. Go out and find you someone who will.", "I love a good rock concert!", "It must've been. I hope that never happens to you again.", "Not too many of those around nowadays", "thats a good idea.", "Whos concert?", "I hope it's what you expected to be!", "Well, I hope you get better soon.", "Oh yea. I heard the buffets there are amazing.", "That is so hard to imagine.She will need all the help she can get from you.", "Cthat sounds amazing!", "I know what you mean, they are cool to look at but if they are near me it spooks me hard.", "Well, absence always does make the heart grow fonder. It will make your relationship a little strained, but the time you guys do get to spend together maybe will mean more and you can enjoy it more. Hopefully his college work doesn't stress him out too much for him to be able to enjoy hanging out.", "Oh, I didn't mean anything about the age! Who cares about that. I'm just a doofus when it comes to social interaction, so I get nervous and avoid things that put attention on me. But I hope you have a lot of fun, especially since your husband went through so much effort. I bet he knows you and what you like well and it will be great.", "Its so commendable that you went over and told them right away.  Not everyone would do that.  Your actions increases my faith in the goodness of people.", "That is awesome", "Oh now I see lol. Who's your favorite team?", "I love BMWs. They must've been so happy!", "Oh goodness, you will find someone better.", "Well, there is your chance", "That's awesome. How long are you guys going to be there?", "I'm glad they did that for you. So it wasn't all that bad having to work on your birthday then.", "Oh wow! That is kind of scary.", "Privacy is so important to have sometimes.", "That is good", "I am very happy for you!", "Me too! I hope we both enjoy it a lot!", "Yes, you should,You are very lucky.", "I know it is so disturbing", "Well I hope you have fun!", "I am really glad to hear that.", "Thanks! What band did yall see?", "Ah I see. That would be a good guess then.", "I am sure you are prepared for this interview.", "Wow! That is a miracle!", "You are going to ace that interview", "That sounds really fun. Hopefully you have some help.", "I can understand that", "I understand your frustration.", "What kind of ghost it was?", "That is cool.  How did you do?", "Ha ha ha. yes indeed!", "Man did you say anything?", "I am very happy for you!", "Oh that's so bad. But, at least you realized your mistake. You are a good person.", "Are you kidding?? They were the favorites all the way.", "Wow, that sounds terrible.", "Well,if he really is your friend you shouldn't.", "Yes! that's very bad. I don't like it either", "I am sorry to hear that.I am sure he is in a better place.", "Families move all the time.The kids will be fine.", "I wish only the best for him.", "That\u2019s fun though", "that is really great.", "I can sympathize with you.", "I am sure she will graduate with honors and get a great job", "I am so sorry. That must be very difficult.", "I see. A war would be horrible.", "I am sorry to hear that.Do you have full cover insurance.", "she sounds like a rude person.", "That is cool, sounds like a good time.", "I can not disagree with you.", "Did you get in touch with  the postal office?", "saying you are scary is weird tho???", "You probably need to get more motivated.", "I hope you will feel better.", "Do you watch any other shows?", "Does your Mother's house have any animals?", "I guess she didn't get a cat then.", "I am glad people still pay attention to the outside world.", "When did you do it?", "Oh my gosh! I would have been so mad. Did you call them and complain? They need to fix it.", "I do have kids. Being a mom can be hard, but it is so rewarding.", "Things will get better soon.", "You should of called and told them.", "I hope you can forgive yourself.", "You should tell them.", "I am sure he can also count on you for everything", "Do you have any children?", "I am sure it was not that bad.", "That was nice of him.", "I hope he can do so quickly!", "What did you do with them?", "i bet it was with something like that.", "Did you go on any rides?", "No, I am well educated. He lowered taxes.", "You should better yourself and fix this situation.", "That's nice you can rely on her.", "You should return it.", "I'm also going to college in the fall, but I'm gonna be a sophomore.", "Will you still be friends with her?", "yea i bet it does.", "Will she apply elsewhere?", "You should.

Especially when you need to call someone or text someone quickly and you need to wait for your phone to start working", "Just focus on what you do have, which I'm positive is a lot going for you!  You can also develop so many more good skills with focus and determination.

I feel bad for people that have to live in areas prone to natural disasters like that.", "If he's done that to you, he's doing it to others -- that kind of behavior isn't sustainable. Others are *bound* to notice at some point -- but I know waiting for that is frustrating!", "If your workplace is anything like mine, you'd have heard plenty by now. I've done something similar, but could call my husband to sneak in some clean clothes - they are useful now and again!", "There is so much competition for jobs", "That's okay. We all make mistakes.

Maybe they will give you something to make up for it", "You could also got out foe a while and do something fun.", "I remember when that happened on the Spiderman movie. Did she laugh at you?", "I would love to go their! I hope you have a great time!", "That's excellent. What was your favorite present?", "Yes, that's a good idea. I think 7am is way too early for that.", "Maybe one day you will be able to work you way up to being the next Tony Hawk.", "One time this lady 1 house away scooped up all the cat poo from my cat under her window into a bag and put it on my front door with a note.  I thought... why did she clean it up for me?  Wouldn't it have been more affective to ask me to clean it up?", "Oh my!", "I'm so proud of him, what is he taking in university?", "I'm glad you're okay- that must have been scary.", "The bill that they quack from.", "Hm.. yeah that is a dilemma. I mean if you can afford it, the honest thing would be to go and offer the manager to pay it back.", "At least you didn't get into an accident.  I guess it could have been a lot worse.", "prayer works for me. I hope it does for you too so that person you just talked about won't get the job", "Wow!  That's amazing.  It must be so awesome that they have each other to hang out and have fun with.", "I have never in my life heard of that breed before.  I'll look it up.  That is really cool I have 3 crazy untrained minpin", "Well there is no 'I' in hope. It is a something we all have to do at some point in life.", "Ugh.

I'd like to be healed!", "Are you planning a new trip for your upcoming birthday?", "That is great. What's the next step- work?", "It's hard to do, but so important.

I think everyone cried during that movie!", "I am not sure how to deal with the loss!", "Yeah, I heard it's good to study in silence because that way you're in the same environment you'll be when you take the test", "Keep your head up. Maybe you'll get picked the next time around.", "Well, hopefully he lived a good and happy life.", "Well I hope he learned his lesson. We don't play those games where i'm from.", "I hope it's nothing serious. I know how upsetting having a sick pet can be.", "That's frustrating, nothing ever seems to go right the first time you try it! Glad you got it working finally!", "Maybe you can find a cheaper place to live?", "Nice! I hope you win!", "NOOOOOOOO!!!! Bad kids! That must have been infuriating.", "Can't stay young forever!", "I'm so jealous! I hope you have a great trip!", "Wow- that's a huge amount of money! What do you plan on doing with it?", "For sure. We sometimes forget that the elderly were young once and did so much like working, raising and caring for their families.", "It is impressive.", "Wow, that must be quite some distance then! Have a safe flight!", "I've been thinking a lot about when I was a kid recently.", "Oh no! That's no fun. I hope they're not still mad at you!", "That is good!  It seems like you dodged the bullet!", "i think the franchise has just started trying too hard.", "There are worse things to be worried about. Good job on you for taking safety seriously!", "Yeah I would too. I hope you get the money back!", "So nice of you.  You are truly blessed to have family.", "That sounds like so much fun!

I know exactly what you are talking about!", "well im confident one day you will win in life something great in life , better than money", "That is very scary. We have had a lot of rain here and when that happens large trees often come down.", "Do you know what it was that happened to kill him?", "I can't say it has worked for me though. I have believed myself a ruler of the world but still live in this box.", "That's too bad. Hopefully it will go on sale in the future or you can find a coupon!", "What is your address?", "Yeah, I hope you won't either. Maybe find a local shelter?", "Oh God, that must have been aggravating.

If only we could go back.", "Hey, hope oyu can get the money back from insurance and they don't charge you a ton more.", "That's funny. Maybe you got the name wrong or something?", "If you have someone with you cards are great. Good luck in your next storm!", "That is not something I would want to come home to seeing. And your day at work was bad too, wow!", "Depending how far away he is, he probably will! Just make sure to spoil him when he does lol!", "Keep your chin up! That special person will come along when you're least expecting it!", "I hope they aren't like a crazy stalker or anything.  Be careful!", "Do you want to get back together with them?", "Well I'm glad you have good memories to remember him by.", "That was a good time for me as well. I liked to hang out with my friends and get in trouble.", "Oh yeah I could see how that might make you feel that way. Is the employee grateful for your help?", "I would have thrown up! Did you tell the manager?", "Aww I bet Snoopy has a great loving family. Glad you rescued the pup!", "Oh i bet it looks great! I just finished a kitchen remodel myself.  i did white cabinets and painted my countertops.", "that's huge.  U actually worked on yourself.  So,  how did you do it?", "Oh ok. That's awesome. It's nice to have something of value.", "Wow.  Well, if that was the culture and climate of that workplace, you are definitely better off not working for them.  Very sad.", "I'm so sorry you had to change your plans!  Perhaps you can schedule some time after Labor Day to come and see him play?", "I hope you you work behind a desk. That is the only way you can hide them!!!", "Congratulations on your new job! You must have worked very hard to get there!", "Ah, well Im sure they had a wonderful time.  It is the happiest places on earth.", "Well you probably won't be lending your car again any time soon hahah!", "Ah, I suppose I could have guessed. It's the game everyone is talking about lately. I heard it's quite good!", "Ha, that would be some pretty good revenge. Maybe you should go ahead and find a new job where you will be appreciated.", "Oh my gosh, that makes it so much worse! I have done that before too, so I hope that neither one of us has that happen again!!", "OMG, those things make the hair on the back of my neck stand up. Hopefully it didn't get into your house.", "That is what I hate about any amusement park ride - the drops!", "I bet they were seriously cute! Did you get to feed them?", "I'll bet it was! I don't have family around, so I know how lonely that can feel!", "That's a good friend for sure - I'd keep their number on speed dial!", "Aww, poor girl. Hopefully the vet can figure it out and it isn't anything too serious. You're doing the right thing.", "I think those are just outliers, you'll find that there are plenty of well established tourist areas that will accommodate you well. Just don't focus on the negatives!", "You can't let it get you too down.  There are some places that just promote people for reasons not related to job performance.", "That's so true! I have a theory that time is just a way to keep everything from happening at once.", "You can and should make the best of it. You should have a blast and binge watch some TV show!", "I'm sure if you just relax and focus on being confident, you will do great! Best of luck!", "That's pretty good!  That should qualify for you to graduate with honors.", "I definately can't run a mile. She did great.", "That's crazy. They shouldn't of taken advantage of your step father like that.", "Oh my gosh they did get you good. You have to get them back even if it's not on April Fools day!", "Well I am sure they won't hold it against you. Honest mistake.", "good luck!'", "I think that's unethical. I would switch to a new one if I could (and all her friends weren't there)", "oh YUCK!  Well, I'd suggest a waterproof mattress cover just in case it happens again.  At least if it does happen again, it won't get into the mattress and you can wash the rest of the bed clothes.  I'm so sorry you discovered it that way!", "Awww well that was nice of you, a lesser person might have stomped it or hurt it.", "Ouch.  That is awkward.  I imagine you can just explain to her that the message was sent to her by mistake.  It happens.", "Thats kind of mean of him.  Tell your boss that he cheated and that you should've won instead.  That'll teach him not to brag", "that sounds amazing. I've only been to puerto rico and the keys. what a lovely wife to give you such a great surprise.", "Well at least it was nothing serious. Hope they don't fight any more.", "Aren't they just the most cute, and insanely calculating animals!", "If you keep a new car long enough it comes out about even! If you keep that in mind then a new car actually becomes a great investment!", "I totally understand, it can be scary if you don't like all the unknown noises.", "That's awesome, I love fighting games.", "thats really good to hear , infections are a serious matter glad your ok", "Most snakes aren't poisonous so hopefully it wasn't. Just know that it probably couldn't have hurt you, and I hope that you don't see any more in the future!!", "Ugh I feel ya. They talked about that with mine, too. I almost passed out when they were doing the epidural!", "Well, I'm glad that things seem under control. I'm also glad that you got to spend some time with the dog because it sounds like you had a great time.", "I understand, trust me.  My family was the same way growing up.", "Yeah, that would not have ended well. I usually take a picture of their license plate and publicly shame them on social media haha.", "I am terrible at math", "Cool cool, when do you think it would be best to visit Mississippi?", "I'm sure it will make you feel a little better. And at least that way you can pick a group based on similar interest. I hope you get to feeling better.", "The scene with his daughter was pretty sad. I don't blame you at all.", "i hope you have a lot of fun , i cant wait to go on my vacation as well", "Were you rooting for them to win?", "I guess she wanted to keep it a secret for some reason.", "Well you can only keep going and keep playing. Someday it could be the real winning ticket.", "They sure do. I also really like watching them do trick skiing too.", "This is true.", "That sounds great, I'm a bit jealous. I love theme parks!", "Oh I bet that was a load of anxiety! I can't imagine going through that", "How will it make it easier?  More financial stability?  I hope you get it also!!", "Oh wow, you think they would get to cleaning up an animal that big as soon as possible. Glad it's gone now though!", "I remember playing tag and hide and go seek in the neighborhood with all of my friends", "Hah, I bet some things you probably wanted to forget. I know I did.", "we are all the new kid for a moment. soon it will feel like you fit right in. just give yourself some time.", "Ouch, I hope you don't either. I'd keep any eye out at work from now on.", "As I understand it, Croatia were the underdogs so I can totally understand supporting that.", "That's neat, did you feel nostalgic looking at it?", "oh no. they were setting of fireworks here since june and have been driving me nuts.", "well at least something positive came from it.  i bet no one else will mess with her either!", "Maybe you should have someone go down with you.  Good luck!!", "I totally know that feeling. It seems that everyone thinks that their situation is more important that everyone else's.", "That's awesome! Did you still give her a nice tip though? Lol!", "I see. Do you feel okay when he invites others or is it a bit uncomfortable?", "I'm sure you'll be fine! I have hope", "That's good for you though, now you both get paid", "oh no. hopefully it was an innocent prank.", "I bet they are.  I hope he is heathy and happy!", "Oh yeah those are very nice. Well I hope you guys can make it happen.", "That sounds great! We are going on a cruise next Spring Break with my family also. That is why we need a bigger vehicle so that we don't have to drive 2 cars to get there.", "Pizza makes everything better. Hope your night ends on a good note!", "That's awesome, hope you're enjoying your new ride!", "I get that feeling.  Something about the dark just feels so depressing sometimes.", "Do you have fond memories of school or were you glad to be done?", "Memories are a good thing", "that's so great! lots of hard work i bet.", "That will be very different.  How do you feel about it?  I wish you lots of luck and adventure while you're there!", "The human body truly is amazing. I could never do things like that either. Either way, I am happy for her!", "That is so terrible, life is so short.  you never knwo when you're going to go", "Well that sounds terrible, I am sorry", "i love to make shredded bbq chicken sandwich, get chicken breast seasone place in crack pot", "people like that , is what kids need a strong back bone that never give up", "I don't see any negative aspect to it, but maybe there tis.", "Oh gosh I bet! It's so hard to watch them grow up!", "I am sure, grieving can always take time. It is so hard to lose such a faithful companion.", "my husband are a 1 income household so i totally understand. you get what you can with what you've got so you can get by until the next payday", "I think you risk not building social ties with your coworkers but sometimes you have no choice.", "Yea it's always sad when a relationship doesn't work out.  Hopefully in the future he can be more honest.", "No, to pay it off.  Are you pushing to finish it up sooner than you normally would?", "Maybe you can talk to her about it?", "You will get something soon that hard work is going to pay off.", "I'm sorry for you loss.", "Is it multiple choice?", "I see,  Did you have different colors in your room as a kid?", "That's so true! I live 700 miles away from my best friend and when we get together it's just like old times.", "Thats mean of them.  I hope you weren't traumatized.", "Honestly I would have freaked out.  I cant stand bad drivers!!", "That's a rough situation. I hope you can look back on it later and laugh as well.", "Just imagine that you are the boss,  or have a few drinks before.", "What team are you rooting for?", "I personally struggle with that every day.", "I CANT BELIEVE THAT.

Fireworks aren't illegal where you are?", "That's awesome, I hope you win the contest.", "That is good, you can't live in the past", "I only played the fourth one. All I remember was Leon!!!", "How are they making money off what they are known for though if they give it away for free?", "I guess now you'll be more careful about where you leave your phone. I would be freaking out if I were you!", "Ohh, sometimes people don't understand simple things. I think the words like 'petrodollars' might have confused them.", "Ok now this is just getting weird. Can we talk about something else.", "If you did it that time, you can do it again. Just be careful", "oh my lord.  Kids,  they can never make up their mind.", "Its hard to feel under appreciated at work.", "That's actually quite hilarious.", "That's great.

And she'll probably support you no matter what you decide.", "That is adorable. Did they get along with the dogs?", "work! my boss sent me here against my will", "What is your age difference?", "How do you feel about that?", "I hope it works out. i don't want anyone to be out of work.", "It takes some time.

Not many people are that generous.", "Oh yuck! That is so gross!", "If we could just get more people on board to do that we would be on the right track.", "That's great. Health scares are very real and scary.", "Ha! I hear you on that. I also loved the Matterhorn! And the Haunted House. We used to spend summers in Tucson with my grandparents, and they would drive us to Disneyland every year ;-)", "Oh, very cool. I thought about majoring in English, too, but decided to go a different route. I hope your new degree helps you land the job you want! You're now in the exciting unknown part of your life.", "I am sure it will get beter", "There's always Uber!", "I've actually lost two family members last year, so I can relate. It's something that will stick with you until the day you die.", "I am sorry to hear that. Maybe next time you can just ask her.", "It's a tough market out there, but I have faith that you get what you desire!", "I can only imagine", "That sounds fun. Have you done something like it before or is the whole kind of job new to you?  Good luck and I know you'll do great!  Act confident even if you don't feel like it. Sometimes that can help.", "Ah, I see. Well, it's a good thing you were rejected thing, maybe. At least now you know what kind of a bullet you dodged. Plus, this is just another step in your overall confidence and character building. The next time you ask someone else out, it will be easier.", "Yes, a very cool thing.", "Maybe next weekend will be better for you!", "I am sure it will soon", "honesty is great and all , but sometimes you need some time to yourself, i feel you on that tho", "That's great to hear!", "If you always wait for somebody to come with you, you may miss out on a movie that you want to see as well. So there's that.", "oh thats cool", "Ah, pretty cool. It's nice that you decided to have family time instead of just alone time. I bet they were excited, too. Hopefully work rewards you more often like that.", "I would love to go to hawaii", "I'm proud of you for sticking to it!", "Maybe it was an armadillo. I get them in my yard sometimes.", "Maybe I'm too gullible as well because that would convince me!", "I've been there. It's so sad, but it will get better.", "One tip I tell people is that they don't need to change WHAT they eat, only how much. Calorie intake is the important factor, not what type of calories.", "I would definitely take as long as you need, so you don't put unhealthy pressure or expectation on the animal to live up to a memory it can't live up to. But if you feel comfortable with the idea, then I would consider it when the time is right. You'll know when that is.", "Do you know why he gave it to you?", "Well I'm glad he got some antibiotics for it. I hope that helped enough!", "Well that's great. I'm happy to hear you guys are getting out of a bad home.", "Well, it's good that at least you're making progress!  It would be crazy frustrating if you weren't.  Congrats on your hard work paying off.", "I'm so glad that you had the chance to make those memories with your cousins!", "I agree, at that age kids should definitely know better and think before doing something. Unbelievable.", "Yeah, but don't worry. More memories are yet to come!", "Well, maybe it's an opportunity for introspection. For you to take time out of your day to think about what you need and want, and what are the best ways to achieve that. Maybe you need a better diet, or sleep schedule, or meditation, or an exercise routine. Sometimes you have to spend energy to feel energized. It's a slow process in the beginning, but it can be life-changing.", "That's awesome! I bet these next few days will fly by", "My husband also has a Lenovo. He really likes it!", "You will be able to say you saw him before he was famous!", "There has to be something. It can't just be this weird vulnerable loophole. I really hope so, for your case, because that's just unfair. I'm sure your work will understand, but it's still a crummy situation that is probably affecting all areas of your life. Transportation gets taken for granted. Hope things get better soon.", "I can see why its even harder on you when they leave.  That's wonderful that they are such a part of your life.  Take care and get out with friends soon to brighten your spirits!", "You might want to call 911 if they continue banging on the door.  Better safe than sorry!", "I wonder how people figure that thing out about themselves? Very cool, though.", "Then it was your lucky day. I usually follow someone like that and they will end up getting pulled over before me.", "LOL.  Do you really think so?  That has happened to me before.  Sometimes, it's just too hard to pass up.  Thank you for sharing.", "You can do anything (realistically) as long as you stay consistent and take it one day at a time!", "oh thats cool then", "Yeah, it blows my mind that people think they can damage other peoples belonging and just go about their day.", "Thank you very much. Much success to you!", "It's all good. Maybe you should try something simple like Hamburger Helper. Can't really  mess that up.", "That is friggin' awesome! I sure hope they can keep up the quality in the upcoming movies.", "You had a good idea. Each of us need to find the correct way to lose weight.", "I know you're do great then!  Hope it brings you a lot of success!", "I will have to try to watch it.  Sounds like a good time", "There are laws here but they find ways around them. People are cruel and only care about money.", "was it big", "thats awesome", "That must mean you're a hard worker. You should keep at it then!", "Yeah, absolutely. That's what I meant earlier, too, about being high maintenance. I don't know, maybe earbuds? But I'm sure you've tried that. Who knows how they would respond if you asked them personally, and if they actually did improve, they'd probably just forget and revert back in a few days anyway.", "Haha!  That's funny!  I work out to drink and eat bad food as well!  Awesome achievement with your running!  Keep at it!", "I'm glad! It's the honest truth. Everyone screws up. And I bet it will motivate you to never make that mistake again, too. So in the end, they have someone who's sharper about things. Good to hear it worked out in your favor.", "i have in real life friends , and a regular job , but because of back problems and sciatica ive made many friends online i consider to be like brothers social media has let me make relationships while in bed lol", "I feel your pain. Life is really unfair sometimes.", "I feel ya.  The kids will be all grown up by then!", "I guarantee they will!  That's raw talent right there!", "i wish you good luck..", "I never did want to hold it, but I was curious enough to touch it! They're actually kind of cute.", "Well good luck! I know how frustrating that can be", "I agree. It must be hard to get any sleep. I feel bad for any animals in the area too!", "that i think you are right", "Good for him. It takes me forever to find a job.", "Well congratulations! :D", "that's a great husband and best friend", "Oh that is frustrating. I bet you were very annoyed.", "thats awesome .. i wish i could go there..", "I hear you. At least it is only for a month. Maybe you can make some weekend trips to do fun things.", "Well, at least you were honest about it.  I bet you will never put your shirt on inside out again!  So, consider it a lesson learned!", "I am glad you were able to look back fondly and remember that good times.", "Yeah, it happens to the best of us.  You just have to try and forget about it and move forward.", "Oh wow! That will be really fun!", "im sorry to hear that.. she will be in peace soon enough.", "That's too bad. Maybe they could check security cameras for you.", "i hope you find happiness .. doesnt look like its gonna be with him.. goodluck though!", "I would be heart-broken as well. You know you can always talk to me if you need to", "I bet you will miss your feline friend. Hopefully they are in a better place now.", "I found a garden snake in my yard the other day and despite it being little it still creeped me out", "Yes, that is nice. A baby shower, just without the people. Still great!", "Well, you don't want to date someone who doesn't like coffee anyway. :)", "You should go out and meet friends! Go out and do hobbies that you like. I bet you'll meet some new friends. Are you in a big city?", "Oh that is so sad. I hope you find him!", "Maybe you can get a pet to distract you. It could even help socialize like if you get a dog and go to a dog park", "Yeah I know how it is. My kids drive me nuts now. They are 8 and 9.", "I say in that case don't worry about it. Mistakes happen.", "Nice. How did you find the city?", "You never know.", "That's wonderful. A car is one of the most useful purchases one can make I think.", "That could be some trauma there... but I am sure you will get back into the swing of things (no pun intended).", "I'm glad you feel better knowing that it will happen next week.", "That is so cool. I'm glad you found your soulmate!", "Pretty names. Mine are Kaitlyn and Alyssa.", "Oh wow so the pressure is on to make a good impression haha", "That's a recipe for success. I think you'll crush it.", "That's great! I think as long as he is happy, he's doing whatever is right for him.", "They absolutely do. Kids are like sponged. It's been said that it's much easier for kids to learn multiple languages than adults", "That is awesome to hear , preparation will help you knock this out like a champ", "That's good. I was never very good at math in school.", "You may want to smoke less next time. Do it in moderation.", "Hmmm.   I encourage you to keep trying.   Even if you don't ge tto your dieal weight, just getting halfway would show trememndous progress.", "Such things even though may seem little have much positive impact on couple's relationship", "He is moving forward pretty fast. But that means you can ride with him that much sooner.", "I'm glad you found a job quick! That must have felt a little good to tell them at least", "I'm sorry that you had to experience that.  It's totally unfair!", "Very true. What would you want to do in the 60's?", "I understand. You could find a book club outside school.", "Do they have any aspirations yet or are they just figuring out life?", "Aww, that does sound quite lovely. Before you know it it'll be 20 years! Any special plans then?", "That's a good attitude to have. Good luck, I'm sure you'll do great (assuming you keep the procrastination in check)!", "What did you do to protect yourself?", "11 years is a long time, I hope you have a great time!", "wow that's great!", "Yes, because a dead battery is much easier to fix than a busted starter or ignition switch.  :D", "wow! That sounds wonderful, I wish I were there too.  Are u wishing a special gift?", "Have you met in person?", "I hope the surgery went successfully and with no hassle. I had a friend who went through the same thing. Wish you all the best", "Just concentrate on the here and now......Your partner will be back soon.", "Buy him something sweet, like a chocolate cake, it usually helps.", "Thats great, never lose touch with your childhood.", "I definitely have a Switch on my Christmas list! Maybe I will get myself one for my birthday.", "Oh, your situation knocks mine out for sure. That's great that they did that. Traveling is unfortunatly, very expensive", "Once, I was watching a horror movie a loooong time ago and the phone was ringing in the movie and then didn't work all of a sudden and then it happened to me and my friend in real life right at the same time! It was crazy but it was just a storm outside. ha ha.", "Same thing I guess, it's hard to imagine such situations.", "That's true. I hope you find someone new to share it with.", "Would you like to buy me something? I'm just kidding. That's great; you deserve it.", "Think of positive thinks instead, you have control over that.", "Well make sure it is going straight to you. No drinks or smokes unless you say so.", "I am a fan of GAme of Thrones though.", "Good choice, I forgot what outside is", "You're a good person. Everyone isnt so lucky.", "Well good luck, its a tough life.", "You might fall in love with it and end up sticking it out.  You never know, but leaving family is hard.", "Oh.

Just be glad justice is served.", "Do you get to gether for all holidays?", "Those bums. Maybe then need to be reminded who is the boss.", "I'm happy for you. If only more bosses were like that, the workforce would be a lot happier and productive I think.", "I can understand that too....  Did you double check the bread before the next sandwich?", "I would definitely give them a bad review and try to speak to someone higher up.", "He shouldn't have a license.", "Growing up is hard at every stage in a person's life", "That is really good.  I've found that a good schedule is the backbone of a good year.  It sounds like you've got it figured out.", "Well that's good. You guys will enjoy each other.", "Hopefully that never will happen to you again, that is terrible.", "Well, I wish you the best of luck.  I understand that is a stressful situation", "That is really annoying to hear. I would be so furious if I was in your position.", "That is pretty annoying for sure. I hope they get moved in so they stop bothering you.", "Do you play too?", "That is so annoying.  Have you reported him, or asked him to be sure to close the mailbox?", "Are you goig to travel?", "I agree. Kids can get a lot more out of sticking to those types of sports other than just physical exercise. It teaches them great personality traits like dedication and hard work.", "refund and tickets wont do anything , someone messed up big and they need to be fired", "Well I had to call my landlord once to get back in my place. I know how it feels.", "It is always a great feeling when you see your kids succeed.", "Uh oh, well only have kids if you really want them.", "Must have been pretty cool to watch. How much do you bench press?", "I agree, they should check their dates more closely!", "If you ever need help with a gambling problem talk to someone, never keep it bottled up.", "You need to get into more relationships, then you'll enjoy it more.", "You are right. Now you know who your real friends are.", "Excellent. When i was visiting Turkey, they had the same thing for carts used to carry your luggage", "Forget him. There are soo many girls out there.", "I'm sorry, I think you are making the right choice.", "Maybe you shoud pretend you are still at work until you get the hang of it.", "Oh, I thought you stole them, but I've done that before too. Not to that extent though.", "Well, you just have to be patient.", "Take a chance and go to a coffee shop or bar.", "How many kids are you talking about?", "Happy to hear! have a happy home!", "I'm ready to meet my interviewer tomorrow.", "That's impressive for a 3 year old!

He was a beagle mix named Jack.", "The movie did? It sounds like maybe at least it was a good movie, if that's any consolation. I hope no one made fun of you. It's a common human mistake.", "I like to stay home where I know i'm a little saffer.", "Punch him right in the nose, that will fix things i'm sure!", "Maybe you will be able to replace it soon. What happened to it?", "You are my hero.", "Sounds like he was ok. I've had injuries before and they weren't serious enough or worth the hassle of the emergency room. But he still had to take a trip to go somewhere. Don't be afraid to care though :) One person is all that is needed- Kindness is always good!", "Holy cow... That is really awesome. That's nice of you to dedicate your free time like that. I sincerely hope everything works out. I appreciate you sharing that.", "my nieces and nephews are all growing up on me and my step kids are almost adults too. it goes by in a blink of an eye", "Its funny how items can bring back such good memories.", "That's a shame. Does your dog chew on shoes often?", "I'm sure it will be ok. A new year is a new time to reinvent yourself.", "I want to get a car one day i think.", "Not mine at all, i enjoy my house.", "You are lucky then. Always good to receive things you arent expecting.", "I wish I could be with you and not in school", "Does it upset you? Just think, the family that raised you, actually pursued you and love you.", "What did you call to get towed?", "Maybe if you go somewhere else without the girl.", "I'm really sure you will figure it out.", "Maybe she could if you tried.", "It's funny how you learn things as you get older even if you aren't doing major things. Little things you can learn a lot from", "That's kind of a lame policy. I hope you get to use them at some point, because they should be worth something. If you're just physically unable to because of the job and its demands, and then they end up passing you by, that doesn't seem fair. I hope you get to relax during the holidays, then.", "I hope everything works out for you.", "I'm sure they were, I can barely afford to survive.", "That is bad.  I  always try to remember how long stuff has been in there, but sometimes things hide on you in there.", "Same here and its hard when your school doesn't exist anymore", "Heck yeah!  That sounds like fun!", "Wow! Have you always fished as a hobby? I've never been.", "it's worth it to keep a family herloom", "So it could be something wrong with the soil? I'll keep my fingers crossed for you.", "i would totally freak out", "Is he ok now?", "Remember safety is the first priority of amusement parks, everything will be just fine!", "Oh man!!  Make sure to put some back for retirement or emergency fund!!", "I can understand why you'd start to feel that way. I think it's good that you want to look inward instead of just blatantly blaming other people. That means you can start to look for ways to make you feel better about yourself, that are solutions! But nothing has to be wrong with you. For some, it just takes time. For others, they find it easier to accept someone to settle down with.", "They really do feel that way! There's actually a train in Africa, I want to say Kenya? Where it is like stepping back in time and you go on a week long journey on the train, you have to dress fancy and it seems like a dream come true.", "Is he getting any gifts because he's done so goo?!", "That is cool!  I bet you all had a really great time", "What did you do on the train?", "How long did it take you to clean your house?", "I am with you there.  I hope you get a chance to go there sometime though.", "Oh that's not fun.", "How long was the flight you were on?", "oh haha!  Is this your first time?", "I do not like the beach, too much sand.", "I love going to the movies and getting food!", "It's a man's world, isn't it.", "That's pretty awesome.  I don't guess it cost too much then.", "thats a big one. I bet it was scary. Did you eat it?", "Well it happens to everyone i wouldnt let it keep bothering you. Just laugh it off!", "Were there a lot of people around?", "I would be too, those things are really nice.", "Oh that's not cool, get a different one.", "I bet.  I would be too!  Was the food good??", "Thats a lot of miles, but they make cars good these days.", "Oh no!  I would hope that people had compassion for your situation and if they didn't, well shame on them.  I once peed my pants at a wedding I was laughing so hard.", "Oh wow, that's a big snake!", "Oh congratulations! You are a true hero", "I've heard that it doesn't bother them to lose one limb.  I watch Dr. Jeff on Animal Planet a lot and that is what he says.", "Don't feel any shame.  The medication is called Topomax.  It supposedly stops the receptors in the brain that trigger night sleep eating.  I also know that if you happen to take Ambien,a sleeping pill, go off of it because it actually can cause night sleep eating. Take care!", "Did you find out who did it?", "That is quite interesting.", "I love the way carpet feels after you use a brand new vacuum on it. Almost like it's new again.", "I can understand trying to abide by one's intuition... Are you going on your flight to somewhere where you have something important to do or someone to meet? Perhaps it may be unfair to them or that situation if you don't go through with it. If you want to do it, try your best to think of all the repercussions, and to weigh the pros and cons, and to not let your intuition cloud your judgment.", "It's really hard, especially being thrown into an environment with a two year old and not having them for a consistent basis from when they were younger up until now.", "That's unusual. Are you allergic to something they are fried in or just potatoes in general? I have digestive issues so I get tired too when I eat junk food", "So do I. People need to be more considerate of others.", "Well, whatever makes you happy, that's what you should do. But, still, never hurts to at least have platonic friends :)", "Oh, now I understand.  He is skateboarding.", "You sound nervous.", "For sure! And always check for the wreckless drivers and the ones who cut you off- Thats really bad in bigger cities. Can never be too careful.", "I would imagine that people who have certain personality types are typically drawn to becoming doctors. They all seem to be very compassionate!", "If it makes you feel peace of happiness, definitely!", "That's good. Sometimes we forget to do things that matter to us.", "I'll say. You can appreciate it that much more. What made the difference, if I may ask?", "Oh god...lol- I HATE being sick...When I get sick..it's BAD- So let's hope lol", "Just think positive thoughts and I am sure you will get the news shortly", "I love when everything just seems to work out together. Im glad you enjoyed!", "That's great.  I am glad you're doing well.", "I know this is so hard for you but he is in no more pain and I am sure he is watching over you", "You said that already, how long did it take you to draw this picture?", "Is that a country? i know the name but not the geography.", "I bet.  Nothing is worse than losing a friend suddenly like that.   Keep your head up, friend.", "Oh that is so cool! You must be a great relative.", "They will lose a lot of business over that one. Word of mouth is the best way to hurt someone. That is gross and I wouldn't go back either.", "Oh wow, your daughter is a lot closer than mine whose just 8.  I already worry about it.  I know they'll find some upstanding men but they can take their time in finding them! ha ha.", "That was very nice of your grandma. How much did she cover?", "That was a great movie!", "Staying positive can be very hard, but it helps to be around the right people.", "Great! That is how it should work. Not one guy making a ton more, as it takes everyone to make it work :)", "Was it a significant other? was it the correct decision?", "Understandable. But remember there are always private things. No relationship is perfect. It takes both working hard", "That is so cool. I have been drooling over an iPad!  Is it amazing??", "I think that would help. Is it for vacation?", "I have not been to the movies in a long time. It is very expensive to go these days.", "I would imagine they were quite delighted.", "That was nice of you. Having company helps through grief.", "That is a very good attitude that you have!", "When will you get the results for this exam?", "Oh no :( That sucks. I hope it's only one", "That's pretty cool!  You sound like an awesome grandparent! :D", "I am sure he didn't let you hear the end of that.", "hopefully it happens again soon!", "i know what you mean", "Good, that's really important thing.", "Oh, okay. Well, that is a bit different, but good luck!", "I could not have said it better myself.", "You pay your gramma back and stop drinking. Seriously", "What kinds of snacks do you have for it?", "Does he play the scratcher tickets a lot?", "that makes no sense.", "Sounds delicious, get some queso too!", "That is exactly what I've been going through along with horrible doctors that did nothing for me.  I just went high nutrient vegan 3 months ago and am improving my leaps and bounds.  I follow Dr. Joel Furhman.  You can keep going and your journey is giving you compassion for others that are going through horrible things.  Take heart and I hope you feel better.", "I know right <3. Such a great time when we weren't the adults as well! lol- Paying bills is no fun.", "Were they expensive pants?", "Sure! If you've never ridden it, then you really should.", "Yes, how much did it cost to fix the tire?", "Me too... those are my favorite type of movies", "Oh no, you must be devastated.  I'm sorry.", "Oh, I feel sorry for you.", "my mother lives far away, and I live with my father, but its not ideal", "Oh no I am so sorry about that. Did everything turn out ok?", "I see. I'm sorry you're home alone.  I get lonely myself when you're used to someone around.  Are you going to advertise for a new roommate?", "Do you know if it is a boy or girl?", "It just wants you off the phone instead.", "Oh, I thought it was a t a restaurant.", "I don't think they will.  We are the worlds greatest army", "Is your nephew a big kid?", "Yes, little brothers can sometimes be irritating.  Maybe ask him next time to turn it down?", "That is awesome, I've been there when I was a kid and had a lot of fun!", "How are you faring in todays climate?", "Yeah, that's always rough. I would take them to court if it's in the 4 digit range.", "What else is there to do there other than see the falls?", "I feel the same way!", "My niece lives in Los Angeles. I do not get to see her very much.", "I have 2 kids.  I love being home with them as well. I am blessed to be able to work at home.  I also homeschool them and love teaching! Are you having any more kids?", "I am so happy for you!", "Sounds great! Better pay is always good!", "Do you know what you are going to spend it on?", "It will get better put your foot down and maybe say no in a nice way to not step on any ones toes.", "Oh nice! My brother in law is a lawyer and I remember him trying to get certain jobs he wanted and it not being easy sometimes.  Sounds like you are a great lawyer.  Hope it goes well for you!", "Nice, I really like folk music. I hope you guys put off a great show.", "You are so lucky to have a family like that!", "that is one of the most horrible things ive ever heard.", "Maybe you could talk to her after you calm down a bit.  I'm sure there is a reason.", "Maybe you could facetime your wife.", "Wow I would be mad to.", "Yeah, that's no fun. Maybe you'll get offered the next promotion that is available?", "Oh lord..that gives me chills just hearing the word. What was it on?", "I feel like this is obvious,  but is he white?", "Yeah... I had to do a long drive from Nebraska to Colorado this summer. It was about a 7-hour drive. That was starting to push it. So, I could see 9 hours being a little rough. I just tried to load up on podcasts to listen to.", "Yeah.  He will get to spend more time with you all now!  Take the father on a vacation!", "Now that was mean and cruel nothing funny about that best outcome is you are fine be careful next time.", "I bet.  I can't believe they didn't alert you.  Were they able to take care of it for you and suspend the charges and the account?", "I really wish the best for y'all.  Good health.", "That is impossible thou. It is a dog eat dog world out there.", "That is cool. Are you going alone or with friends?", "Maybe you should move out? Have you thought about that.", "Oh yes of course! I am sorry.", "I'm sure it was a great comfort to you. Food is a great way to tell someone you care.", "You sure are! At least you appreciate and acknowledge so I'm sure she is pretty glad to have you as her child.", "I'm sorry to hear that. We all have our demons. Sometimes it's good to take one day at a time and try to stay positive.", "That's something to be proud of! Good job!", "Oh, okay, I believe I know what you are talking about now. He is a good actor and usually his movies are great!", "A simple call would have been nice hopefully he has a good explanation for this.", "I understand,  If a pizza is more than 10 dollars, im not paying.", "I'm sorry, maybe one day when he gets older.", "Oh, well that's a bonus! No one needs sleep on christmas lol", "Well, dogs are good for protection.", "I read that wrong, I thought you said you tripped over a vase and it broke. Will you be in trouble if she finds out?", "I'm sure once she calms down, she will look on it as not as big of a deal.  If you have to work, you have to work.  I hope you can work it out!", "Oh man, he didn't charge you? You both kind of won then! A good story for you both at no cost. Well, except for time. It was a good learning lesson. And yeah.. the bumper sticker.. that's crazy. I'm glad you're able to not take yourself so seriously. That makes for a great personality.", "Oh, well, you're going to have to say, Mom, I know you're tired but I really want to see this movie, can we please just go? It'll be fun, we need time together.", "Yes, one day at a time.", "That's great! What kind of tasks do you do?", "Interesting.. Did he get in trouble? Was this at a high school or something? And does he take gymnastics?! Back flips are hard!", "Are your political views the same? and do you think this next fight will end well?", "Yeah, that's a good idea. That's always a solid way to go about it. My roommate had a breakup 6 months ago. I tried not to give any advice that was too specific, because the best solution always has to come from that person themselves. My roommate ended up just focusing on himself as much as possible, diving into artistic endeavors, trying to work out, etc.", "That's too bad. Lesson learned, I guess.", "That's quite a ways. Do you have any hobbies that could help you meet new people?", "For Sure. Before you know it, he'll be saying full sentences!", "Find some good books and good therapy and make your life what you want it to be. If you truly love your partner then don't lose them over feelings. Feelings are fleeting.", "You sound like you've dealt with more hardship than the average person. I wish I could empathize with you, but I've been lucky to avoid that kind of thing recently. But I do hope things will turn out differently for you soon. If anything, these things will make you more resilient than the average person, too. That's not worth nothing.", "Sounds exciting. Will you do it again?", "Oh wow,  I hope they do well.", "A two month vacation sounds amazing! I figured it was for work or something when you said two months. What is your favorite thing to do in the Bahamas?", "Congratulations. I wish you the best of luck. Parenthood is a blessing.", "What did you do with Goldie after she died?", "That is a good sign!  I know many kids that age who have no direction so it sounds like he's really going places.  Do you have any other kids that will still be at home?", "My father was an architect. So I have heard about these exams.", "Oh lol! It's ok, you are a mom and it's the hardest job EVER and very thankless. You are doing good", "Yes you have to do what is best for yourself. Take care of you before others.", "It can be cheap to go there sometimes for an easy filling meal, with the deals and coupons they have, I think. With the bread and soup you can get. I hope you guys had a good time!", "The first job out of college is a good way to test the waters but someday you will have to spread those wings.", "Great to have some hands on help parallel parking is very hard but once down packed it is easy.", "It sounds like you have determination, and that is worth more than a 4.0", "Hope Dak has a good year! I am all about the tailgating.", "Oh goodness, that is so creepy!", "Know your limit once you start gambling it will make it much easier so you won't go broke.", "Well, as long as you're patient and careful, you'll minimize your mistakes. There are those who go out there and think they know everything. Even if they're a good driver, they may be more likely to slip up and have a problem than you would. So, just stay positive!", "I'd be worried about having these kinds of feelings towards your wife.", "Clowns are scary. Did you make it out safe?", "That is good to hear. I like the ones that are funny better.", "That is good to hear I would enjoy a night with some great music.", "Oh no. Are there other people at home with you?", "You should see 8th grade. Nice story about a girl growing up. You will like it.", "wow, I bet Chinese is one the State Department really needs right now. I hope your friend gets the job.", "Ah I'm glad that's over for you then. Now you're less likely to forget doing laundry again.", "Yes I agree, guys are a little let reliable sometimes.", "Maybe she is part kangaroo afterall.", "AH-HEM! What I meant to say prior to my keyboard malfunction was...that sounds really neat! Where are you going to go camping?", "He deserved it, that scumbag.", "That is very true. Well I am glad she is OK. Thanks for sharing about it.", "Try to stay calm and do your best. Good luck!", "It's good to focus, but surely you can take a few hours to take in the culture.  China has a long and interesting history.", "hahaha...aww..cant give away the pupper", "Those are really good. I am more of a burrito man myself.", "you are very lucky,  is greek your favorite food?", "Cool I like Harry Potter. You have a really nice aunt!", "that's great. were you losing for a special occasion or just to feel better?", "I feel you.. When my pet dunken passed away, i got a new dog, named him dunken and restarted our relationship from there", "It's funny, you guys walked into work that day and thought it'd be another usual, boring day. You clocked out maybe with some blood on your shirt, smelling like newborn. Awesome.", "They really should be more considerate. allergies are a serious medical concern.", "Yeah, that happens all the time with me. Well, actually, it doesn't, since I can't text because I wear Hulk Hands all the time. I just smash things.", "If he wasn't happy with the food, there arebetter ways to tell you.", "Maybe she just wanted to go play. I hope she comes back.", "Never thought about that. Thank god you recovered it!", "That's really nice. The world needs more people like you.", "i would be really angry", "That's really good! Did they give you a raise?", "That's really great. I am proud of your success.", "I think you can do it! I mean is there really a limit to the amount of bigmacs one can eat?", "I here they have one of the best zoos in the us.", "True. It is quite terrible to have acne. Mine is so bad that I can't even see.", "I'm glad you had such a fun time.", "im sure the pupper was happy!", "Early congratulations to ya!", "what kind of gifts did you get ?", "That sounds like a really neat job. Are you going to get a promotion soon?", "Yeah I understand.  Maybe you should pay them back by interrrupting them?", "I hope you find one soon. If you don't, you are more than welcome to come work in my sweatshop in Siberia.", "Did the little guy even feel guilty for running away?", "What happened? Is it something because of you or him?", "That sounds like a smart plan. When do you find out?", "it is so nice to see a marriage as strong these days!", "Do they serve coffee? Like starbucks?", "way to go! as you know, hard work always pays off", "LOL it's been on the carpet for a few weeks???  Clean it up already.  She won't do it", "I think if you show that you put in some effort yourself first she won't mind.", "Thought that reminded me of Death Note, but I think L only focused on criminals.", "Well, I suppose it is justified as long as you don't do it all the time.", "Is that how much doritos and a mountain dew costs there. geez", "yes it does, i wish people like that would just get fired", "I think you should have put them in a difficult to reach for babies place", "Just leave it. Try to be punctual here after.", "Wow, that is some fast growth.", "is it going to be the last season? that's too bad.", "Love was so innocent back then.", "Ah, there is your problem right there. 99.9% of the time a stoop kid will chase away nasty pigeons, no problem.", "Is that not funny?

Dont feel bad, it happens to the best of us buddy :)", "is your insurance going to take care of it?", "Dang! I should start watching it. I love Stephen King.", "You should have bought ramen lol", "That's too bad. When is the wedding?", "Oh, Well have fun", "Yikes! Maybe you shouldn't do that again.", "Nah, you're good man. You probably did it for good reason.", "You only have one mother, you should love her no matter what.", "I have no idea where that is but it sound exotic", "might be a bit too far.", "I'm sorry.  Hold on to the old memories.", "Did it take you into a lake like michael on the office?", "I bet your audience missed out!", "I love rollercoasters!", "Ah, yes, I remember now. That mother deserves to be hanged.", "Don't feel so! Forgive them", "do you regret that?", "It is so much fun. I have been there, you are going to have a blast", "Oh sweet. hawaii is a tropical paradise, you are going to love it", "hmmm well thats good for you", "You should.

Hope you have a lot of fun!", "Yeah, I've had that happen to me before. Some bags are cheap and fall apart.", "I would be too!  Did you try to see if you could see someone from another window or just run back to bed?  I'm glad you're ok!", "Oh no that is terrible. How did you find out it had lobster in it?", "Aw, that's a great friend right there. Congrats on your new puppy!", "thats good, make sure to get a case too!", "Oh, I am so sorry - that is an awful thing to happen. But please don't think all women are like that; many are loving and loyal.", "I don't blame you, I would talk to him. Even if he is uninvolved, it is not fair for you to bear the full weight of the tasks at hand. I sure hope he has a solution and the work load eases!", "Yes, and possible it just had too much stuff on it. But, you're right, sometimes it's cheap wood they use.", "I would be scared too.  It is cool that you were brave enough to try though.", "No problem, and I'll send good vibes your way that you pass! Good luck, you've got this.", "ohh that's bad.

I like those kinds of game.", "that is great, its nice to have someone that is so helpful around", "You could just start going in late everyday as well, to make a point to her.", "yup.", "I live in the south but I'm from the north and that's one think I miss is the cooler weather. I definitely dread the summer as well.", "That's very nice of you. Maybe I can learn from you and be more trusting.", "that is not good i really hope you can get it done on friday", "Wow you are a dedicated player. I'd imagine you will do awesome online then.", "i agree! its refreshing to hear someone with a good outlook on life", "small town country life is much more my speed", "It always seems to wait til your head hits the pillow, then BAM!", "so she probably had scar tissue. i hope this one goes better for her.", "lol what country are you in?", "For sure, that is a motto to live by! I wouldn't dream of doing anything different.", "I live in a very large city on the east coast. We have one mall here called The King of Prussia Mall. It's the 2nd largest in the USA. Any time you go it's packed but if you drive 15 minutes to any of the other malls around it they are sad.

No way can I afford that.", "exactly. are you in the usa?", "Right, I think you are in for a rowdy time for sure!", "Don't sweat it.  You'll do great.  Its never a fun process but that's so good you're keeping up with your health!", "Yeah, it's always better to get motivated rather than jealous! Use it as motivation to save more money.", "I think it has its purpose. It makes it easier to find people you lost touch with.", "I live in central Louisiana in the US.

Such a great idea before the chaos of it all.  Its important to do things like that your ourselves!", "Well that is ridiculous. Im sorry", "That's good. If it's like mine-you had to wait forever!", "That does suck", "I bet that will be fun", "That's great. I hope to retire some day.", "I can relate I like to keep work at work but as an adult you spend so much time at work it's hard to meet people other places.", "Yes!  They're legs are so much longer than I thought and they hope over they're 8 foot tall privacy fence like its nothing!", "it's crazy the things they are learning now. it makes you feel like a dummy", "Are there any other types of seafood you like?", "I am sure he did", "Some allow you to make an appointment.

Yeah when you have bad genetics there aren't enough apples to keep the doctor away.", "maybe it was closed event. you speak to her about it?", "I bet you were relieved.", "That's so strange.

She is not the only one who does that.", "Well it think there is a time frame on the bad luck though", "OH wow! Congratulations.

You must be a very strong person.", "Very true! Congrats! It's hard to never win", "I know it's probably hard not to worry. But, it really doesn't change the outcome, ya know!", "I believe there must be a good thing that happened these past few years. Count the good ones and block the bad memories out", "I think so. Having integrity and good character would stop you from doing that, would you want to be cheated on? You should be honest with your partner..or work on and water your relationship if you don't like it the way it is. Cheating after 10 years would truly make you a terrible person to waste someone elses life for 10 years only to go through such a betrayal.", "on purpose?", "Wow. Was he hurt at all?", "I do agree with you", "How far are you guys apart in age?", "What do you put on your nachos?", "What do you need to leave?", "It was a raffle!", "That seems like the best option.

What kind of music do you play>", "It takes some getting used especially since you haven't been alone in a while.", "Converse go with everything too!", "Well. you will get back there.", "What was her name?", "You will get through it", "hah.. thats cool", "That's good and bad I guess.  It would probably be nice to be able to plan on it.", "I agree, and most of the music is older music, too.", "Yea. That would make me cautious as well. I hope nothing like that happens again to you.", "That's terrible. Well you know what they say about karma, they'll get theirs eventually.", "Oh lol. Well if you have a weapon keep it near you.", "That is definitely a no- no", "wow camaros are awesom.i just got a new suv", "Honestly they are both crazy. It's a sad time when those two were the best we had to offer.", "I would too", "oh well.. at least you got some wheels.. beats taking the bus or walking", "That is not too bad", "IT is the worst. My landlord take forever to get things fixed.", "I bet so, I am glad you were able to save her!", "She is a (fill in the blank) she cheated and betrayed you and your marriage...she would never win in court after cheating.

There is nothing like being betrayed by someone you love", "Did you give him some food?", "That's so bad lol", "Maybe it will, I'll keep my fingers crossed for you!", "wow that was a good idea", "It's a tough, going through the job market in general. Persistence is the key.

It is always good to fix them if you can, especially for the nicer ones", "Yes! I agree! I guess a lot of people say 3 strikes and your out, I'm done, but for me, I dont care who you are, I just dont give even second chances to most people!", "Does everyone live far apart?", "hahaha you don't say :)", "Haha I love them. They eat other pest like bugs and mice. Wait until you cat dose that again.", "Oh for sure! I love riding jet skis!", "Great news.  Kids are always an exciting adventure!", "That is a good use of the 100 bucks. I am sure you will pay it forward at some point.", "Man, that's terrible. I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully you can recover.", "Don't worry about it, worrying will only make things worse.", "I'm so glad you weren't there but I still hate to hear it. Did they take anything valuable?", "Was it a tornado?", "I like that music", "Of course. Well karma will get them one day. At least it wasn't a full on accident where you could've gotten injured.", "thats awesome", "You'll have a shot at it again, I'm sure!", "No worries, we all have our hobbies!", "i felt the same avout my moms dog when he passed.something was missing in the house.", "My brother has a large lab, although they're pretty sure it has to be part of something else, because it's over a hundred pounds and looks much bigger than a normal lab. She's a sweet dog, has the energy of a puppy though, so she comes tearing at you with speed and you think you're about to die.. But she's just being playful.", "Troubling times do make us extra vulnerable.", "I would take someone who would be thrilled about it :)", "That's understandable. I bet people have had those stuck in their feet before", "Yes! I would agree! I feel bad your in that situation!", "yea i know how you feel", "Wow! That takes a lot of schooling, I hope you do too! Is it a good company?", "I am happy for you", "It is, we all need time for ourselves!", "oh wow that sounds impressive. good luck!", "How fun! I hope you have a great time!", "It sounds cool", "Hard work goes a long way!", "So fantastic that you could take advantage of it -- *and* get to make some memories with your kids!", "yea and now smart phones are everything!", "Have you confronted him about it yet?", "Awesome! I am happy for you!", "That sounds very nice", "Sorry to hear that, hopefully someone will help you out with that.", "Hahaha.  Nothing says you can't do both.  Work at work, play after work.", "Thats very heart warming to hear", "Sounds like an old coaster they should consider replacing.", "I hope you have a great time!", "That is a tough school to get into. Best of luck.", "Well have a safe flight and make sure you make the most of it!", "Well, hopefully she doesn't keep you waiting for very long, if everything else is right! But maybe be more patient than even you think you need to be in order to play it safe, so she doesn't get scared off, so to speak. Sounds like it will be worth it in the end.", "That sucks. I hope that changes in the future for you.", "Well that's good!", "That's good news. Congratulations in advance!", "That is not your fault", "I hope you have showered her with gifts and appreciation, she deserves it", "yea i can see that also", "Hopefully, you won't have to walk when it's dark out again or at least have people to walk with you.", "Thats what helped me when I moved away.  Video chatting makes it feel like youre still there", "I am sure you are finr", "It happens, you can't beat yourself up about it, it was an accident!", "Well that's a good attitude", "that is always a perfect combo!", "Mistake can easily happened.

Did insurace cover what was lost?", "I guess so, I just hate that my grade would depend on someone else's work.. or lack there of.", "Wow that is a tough school to get into. Did you pay the tuition?", "I heard they are based outside of the country and make calls out of reach of the law.  Like I said, ANNOYING!", "he lived a long life.", "Aw sorry to hear that, hope he/she is fine and you'll able to find it.", "I am sure you will", "He had a good life, yea?", "I would be too", "I'm glad you made that connection.", "That's terrible service.

I'll pray for you!", "Let me knock on wood right now!", "Ouch!  That has got to hurt!  Are you really mad?", "I get that, what do you usually do when they are gone?", "Oh ok. I've only had one job like that.", "That makes sense, kids can be really mean to younger kids, sorry that happened to you!", "You can if you believe in yourself. but you will never know unless you try", "That makes sense I guess", "Good, just make sure to do what you have to still!", "Just reassure him a lot because if he knows you're there for him at the very start of his school career, everything after this will be a walk in the park.  :)", "YES. I didn't see it lol", "That sounds rough, sorry to hear about that!", "yep. I ca't get my kids into things like that. My daughter like minecraft", "Do you feel that 6 months is too fast?", "i feel the same about my husband but you hear so many horror stories you can't help but be a little weary", "That makes sense, was it an important phone call?", "Oh, that is no fun, but at least you have the memories!", "I will. I should be playing the COD beta but I have other things to do", "It'll be well worth it when you can laugh with him over the things he did!", "Oh no, did someobody see you indecent?? That is not good!", "You deserve better. Find something before you leave though", "Oh, did something happen?", "Oh, maybe it is worth something to a collector!", "Wow. Did he/she have it in for ya?", "Nope, I kept everything!", "I wish I had a surprise arty thrwn for me. I would probably pass out lol", "Right, there's always a next time. Don't let it discourage you too much.", "I bet it made your whole day different!", "What kind of cake?", "At 13 everything is interesting to her. She may just want attention.", "I am in the Information Systems field", "They are, I really enjoyed playing them. We also played Donkey Kong.", "That is true, well there is a lot of time left", "I haven't played that one, I will have to try it out.", "Use a recipe and stick to it. If he is a good boyfriend he will appreciate your effort.", "Where did it go?", "We weren't, only 2 1/2 years. It was just the two of us and we were very close, she passed away several years ago.", "I will have to try it out!", "That makes sense, well I wish you the best of luck!", "Give yourself a break. Your financial health is important too.", "That can be tough to do, but will pay off in the long run!", "Then maybe you should think about trying to find a job somewhere else?", "Seriously? Do you like super smash bros? It is coming out in december, I love my switch to death man, it is amazing", "Thank goodness, that will make you stressed.", "Oh that's nice! Enjoy summer while it lasts. What did you go to college for?", "I get where you are coming from. Nintendo fans are not easy to please!", "That sounds like a great time!", "We need you. Hang in there.", "Ah okay, that is good then, I hope they are effective for you!", "That's very unusual. Most jobs don't. I would talk to the managers about it! Paid lunch would be great", "That must be quite dissapointing", "Congratulations.  Thats awesome.  I hope you give him the world", "That is hard, especially being so far away from family.", "You'll do fine. As long as you love him, everything else will work out.", "That sounds exciting! I can't wait to what they come up with next!", "Yep, but you can only help one person at a time.", "Oh, that would not have been fun! They do not like people!", "Are you going to say anything to your surperiors.", "Haha, they can eat ice cream when they are the parents!", "Cherish the moment while you can!", "Something big must have happened.", "I'm sorry to hear about what happened. Are you staying with your wife?", "That is good also. Hanging out with friends is the best thing to do.", "That's really great!", "I am sorry to hear that!", "That's nice. Mine started a couple of weeks ago.", "I know what you mean. We are getting club schedules together for my teen", "You will know when the time is right. I am adopted myself, so I have a special place in my heart for new parents.", "Did you get a lot of gifts too?", "Yes, that happens everytime!", "I will do that.", "Ugh I was hoping that is not the case, I would want my kid to be young forever", "I went to the casino after and won 250 dollars but I was by myself lol", "Sorry to hear that, i hope you get chances to visit!", "What do you do for work?", "It really is!", "I am glad it did not make you depressed!", "I am sorry to hear that, I have been there before.", "no, it's just not my thing. I like sci fi and horror...just not sea stuff", "I hate that too. Especially when you are paying and they are right behind you... like, why?", "Hopefully he  has worked hard for it. I'm sorry you have to deal with that", "You have a lot of hard work ahead.", "That is a nice car!", "I am happy for you", "me too, best of luck!", "Siblings can be our closest confidants, and in a lot of cases, lifelong friends.", "yeah i can relate to that, alone time is sometimes very relaxing", "That's so cute. I have a son named Ethan", "That is even better! School shopping can be so expensive.", "He will be into everything. I know what you mean about looking back. Kids grow so fast.", "I'm sure he will return!", "I know exactly whaat you're saying", "Cool I'm glad it was a success.  I hope it reminded you of good times!", "that is really nice, i still have my wedding dress", "Hey children are a miricle.", "Great, how about a loan ? Just kidding.", "Ok, but at least you got to do something you have always wanted right? visit gulf shores", "The bites take forever to go away, too!", "I think that's normal! Eventually you will adjust", "Maybe you can just get another job.", "How do you feel about that?", "You got it!", "I bet you won't have anything to worry about. We will both excel.", "Well, at least you were able to conquer your fear!", "I do not know, how did you discover that was the case?", "that is normal when you lose someone, but time heals everything", "That is nasty, you have to kill that habit!", "You're a kind person to wish that.", "Oh no! I hope you didn't feel too humiliated.", "I hate interest too. It is always to pay cash.", "It's a very good feeling when someone has faith in you! Good luck with your project!", "Just save up and eventually, you will be able to get them.", "Good idea. Glad you got away safely.", "It's so great to be prepared! I'm sure the interviewers will be impressed!", "True. I bet it was a mad house at the supermarket today.", "Do you usually do good in math? It is my favorite subject and always came so easy for me.", "Well, I am sure he will meet a bunch of jolly good fellows while he's still in high school. You just got to keep on top of him with his grades and he will be fine.", "I play on the PS4. It's the only way to play Madden.", "lol i feel you, i too am lacking in that department", "Ouch. I hope he didn't lose any teeth.", "Although you might have really been scared your story sound kind of funny!", "That's so wonderful. My boyfriend has a cat named Smoke (I call him Smok) that I love sooo much. Good luck!", "I feel you man. Seeing pictures of my baby son tears me right up.", "Dang, kind of reminds me I should probably do something nice for my wife...", "How ironic. Unable to study finances because you're at work making your own.", "The anticipation must be crazy.", "Those cakes are really good! I believe they are made of dried milk.", "That's terrible. Did they give you a reason?", "Pizza is my absolute favorite, I could eat it for the rest of my life.", "Wow. I've gotta see this guy then.", "Silver lining: she said she didn't want to fail you, so at least you passed your project.", "As long as she knows where your intentions are the amount doesn't matter we all wish we can do more but we do what we can don't be down.", "No, it wasn't. I bet you learned your lesson not to steal pretty quickly.", "Very interesting. Maybe I should look into that to connect to my great grandmother.", "Hopefully, you pass at least.", "Well, at least you weren't left there for all eternity.", "So young lol well at least it's a good memory and the good weather makes you happy and think about it.", "Of course! I'm sure he appreciated you being there!", "Some people just have no consideration. You deserve to eat your leftover Chinese.", "good for you, send me a post card, enjoy", "Wow. I wonder how they even saw that the grass needed to be cut living in darkness.", "Wow. I didn't know shoes could cost that much!", "That makes sense to me. Money doesn't always equate to happiness. Hope you are doing better now!", "Thank you. Yes, even though it's been a month since we said goodbye, I still look for him around the house.", "That's great! Maybe I should conquer my fear of heights that way, too!", "I think so too, he knows what it's like to be down and out and to work hard for his own success.", "That is definitely risky. Is the alternative of staying sick better?", "Glad all that studying worked out!", "Distance is sometimes the best healer. Glad to hear things are patched up.", "Those are such smart dogs! I hope it's nothing", "You'll be okay! Use the age old public speaking advice, picture everyone in their underwear! Good luck!", "It must be such a relief. I'm happy for ya.", "I am sure she will like it as long as you followed the recipe.", "Are you a math major?", "I like how creative you got with it, I'll need to try it sometime.", "Oh man, that nervous, hu?", "Nice. At least you won't lose any money.", "Oh my. That is quite a unique first word!", "I know right?!? Sometimes it's just best to be quiet, even though you know you are right, to help things get better.", "Oh yes, best to have her not alone ever during this time.", "If it was the bank's mistake, even if you didn't have enough money, they're responsible for fixing it.", "Me too! It's very hard sometimes, like running an orphanage but it is rewarding as well!", "That's cool, I don't know the first thing about building my own pc.", "That sounds unprofessional. I thought they were supposed to sound neutral.", "Oh! That's a nice program. Well getting any amount of groceries for free is nice, but yes too bad it wasn't a supermarket sweep", "LIttle things build up sometimes. I hope you feel better as well.", "Because I love Domino's so that's the only pizza I think of!", "Oh sweet. How's the new phone?", "Man, the nerve on some people. I would never take somebody's spot if they have a sign up for it!", "Man, I feel bad for his stomach. It's probably as worn out and bloated as my great granddad.", "I guess he learned his lesson.  Only eat 25.  ha ha.", "I agree, what's your favorite?", "Who are the caregivers? His/her parents? Or Children?", "Well they can be, but make sure you buy it next time. Ramen is super cheap :)", "Kids grow up so fast. Gotta cherish every moment sometimes.", "That is terrible.  Has she cut off all contact with them?", "That sucks. And you guys studied the same amount?", "That's great! Hopefully, the meeting goes well.", "Well, I'm not sure about that or how are you typing?!", "Awwwww, that's so cool. I remember when my dog was going through all that over a year ago. They learn so fast.", "I'm sure he won't. Sounds like he's a hard worker.", "Right, have to train them not to I suppose, if at all possible.", "Good luck.", "That's reasonable. Just make sure you get your own when you have the funds available.", "Oh so sorry to hear that. Well maybe you can round them up for something.", "I'm right with you.  Oh, cigarette butts gross me out, not to mention second hand smoke which has been found to cause cancer too.", "Some people just aren't considerate of others like that.", "Wow that would be so cool! I don't do makeup good on others. Did you do anything with her hair?", "That's so cute!", "That's too bad. Maybe she can come with you?", "Wow. I hope you don't ever have to see anything like that again!", "Yeah, well maybe you can offer to pay for half of it instead?", "Yeah, I would be too. Hopefully they'll invite you in the future.", "Right, puppies are like that. It took mine a year and a half before they weren't having any more accidents like that.", "Well, it certainly sounds like you deserve it. You sound like a good person.", "Glad all that hard work paid off for ya. I aspire to get there someday myself.", "That's awesome.  Are you a nurse?  I used to work in the NICU.  It was a wonderful job.  Good luck with your new position.", "Aw well, as long as she is a good mom, more power too her :) Children are great fun.", "I'm sorry to hear that. Are you thinking about changing your diet and exercise routine?", "ok", "That's really great. You should go join the circus.", "Must've gave them a good chuckle. Don't worry. They'll get over it.", "Dang. Well, I am sure you won't make that mistake in the future!", "I am very sorry to hear all of that, it is a little more expensive, but I found I feel so much better I can actually work more o make up the difference.  Check out Dr. Michael Greger, too if you haven't he is a great resource as well.", "Oh, I feel you! I used to be a food addict as well when I was younger. It is a hard habit to break! It's amazing how far you have come though! So many don't realize that fresh real food make a difference and you feel so good when you get real nutrition!", "Yea, maybe you can find an alternative. I lost a few shirts over the years before too, it's no fun.", "Sounds like you're ready to go!", "Best of luck to you, I hope everything works out great in the end!", "She probably bad mouthed you while out there.", "That's always a plus. I am sure that will make the search less stressful.", "That's why I don't have carpeting.", "It's always great to reconnect to old friends.", "That is really terrifying.", "I would too if my wife did that. It's alright, man.", "Dim sum, huh? I haven't heard of that before. What exactly is that?", "What did she eat on your date?", "Yea. You should definitely hold off on buying a new car for now.", "Like a bathroom maybe!  some people really just dont understand manners.", "Yeah, it must be a pretty embarrassing moment. Although it's an honest mistake.", "That's great, losing a pet would have been awful.", "True. But, you can't help stupid people from getting high paying jobs. I am a prime example.", "Then it is a little bit scary. Did you try to find him?", "That's pretty cool. You guys must have a good relationship.", "I wish you luck anyway!", "I hope that that was the last time you have to clean up any messes! Sending my prayers!", "I would like to come there and see it, how are you doing it?", "I've heard good things about the Navy and also how tough it is.", "Don't forget to get some rest though.", "That sounds incredibly tasty. I think I will have to go there.", "aw I'm so happy for it. Do you miss it?", "Yes she certainly does! I guess she makes up for it in other ways!", "They sound great! Happy birthday to you!", "Must've been really terrifying. What did your parents do?", "That is really said. I hope that she gets a new mom some day.", "It will be fine! You'll be staring at an A before you know it!", "That's great. I'm glad you got to feel that feeling.", "That is lame! what was their excuse?", "True. Sometimes you have to lower your standards to something more realistic.", "Yeah, pushing herself could end up to her having a horrible life.", "That's funny and also kind of a waste of pizza.", "Awesome! That makes me glad that there are still teachers and professors that truly care!", "I hope it turns out well whatever it is.", "I don't know how anyone could turn an abused child away..it's not easy but they need help.", "Yes I would be too. I hope you catch them and I hope he didn't loose too much stuff.", "thats disgusting , then why even be in a relationship waisting someones time", "I love having that feeling. Especially after eating a healthy snack!", "That's comical. Most of us don't reach 90.", "Hmmmm...Maybe he just went on vacation?", "I don't think the polar bears are gonna let you near their coke, man.", "Wow, sounds pretty impressive!", "How long ago was this?", "oh .. do they visit often?", "Was it parked at home? That sucks", "ah.. that sounds like a smart move.", "I guess he really does do it for the passion of teaching then.", "It's good to reunite with them again, hu?", "Glad your hard work paid off. Was this marathon for a good cause?", "Well hopefully nothing bad will happen and you won't need to use it.", "Oh god. I'm guessing they didn't take responsibility?", "thats a good idea then if she can manage it", "I hope you find the peace that you deserve and know your pet loved you!", "Will he be in school this year?", "That is awesome.", "I'm away from my family for the past 10 years.", "That's so kind of them. I'm glad you're repaying their kindness.", "oh good luck!", "Will you get a refund?", "That's all you can do at this point", "Wow, that's impressive. A very exotic dish for sure!", "Well if you were playing me you would definitely win", "Hey being single isn't that bad! You'll find your soulmate one day when the time is right.", "that is a little aggravating , i would be pissed too", "i agree.", "Nice, sounds like a relaxing weekend.", "A C is not too bad. I know how you feel, I hold myself to a very high standard as well. It could have been much worse though!", "Yes, I would be too. That was so irresponsible of them!", "I'm sure it will go well! What are you cooking?", "I'm hoping for a miracle for you so that you can get a little bit of shut eye!", "That is a good surprised.", "Well I think you'll be able to sell it for a good price.", "good times , you got to hold on to the memories", "I thought I had seen every episode of lock down. I haven't seen that lol", "I hope she does too. Maybe spend extra time loving on her tonight she she'll feel better.", "I hate lightning. It makes me jump every time.", "Won't you visit?4", "They probably changed their crust or something, they always do that mess.", "I know right. I was never truly explained the world of bills", "that sounds like a great plan honestly", "Yes, you must be very proud for accomplishing that.", "That should be fun. I have to work this weekend. I need to hang with friends before I go crazy", "Oh no, I have to take her side now. Summer's are made to break the rules.", "Well, that has never happened to me. I never think about work when I'm not there lol", "i used rope from the warehouse once as a belt", "If only they had told us sooner.", "That's cool! Are you gonna go all out with decorations and things?", "Then throw the whole dude away and get you a new one! You deserve the best!", "Make sure to leave feedback on their profile. Hopefully they can't get any more rentals.", "I understand. Sometime, I become also superstitious.", "That's true. Were the questions even important?", "I think it's time to hide your drinks from them. It works. That is what my Mom did when I was a kid.", "Think positively. Stressing yourself out can definitely cause a problem", "Probably so but they'll remember it in the future and have fond memories.", "It's okay, everyone makes mistakes sometimes. I hope the other driver is okay.", "Oh no, I've been there done that too many times.", "You won't believe how many times that has happened to me", "i really like going once a month to buy something i really want helps with my anxiety", "Aww that's so sad! But it's good to know she will be remembered", "dont we all :)", "I never got into the pokemon craze", "Oh no, I hate to hear that. Did he have a good reason?", "I know right. Especially for women.", "You will when the time is right and it'll be beautiful.", "So true. Whenever it happens I just close my eyes and embrace it.", "I'm sure she really appreciated it. I know I would.", "Better luck next time.", "Still though, that's some crazy stuff to be walking in on though!", "UGH, thats the worst! atleast you have a nice friend!", "that does sound terrible", "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be rude. Hopefully his demise showed someone out there that drinking is bad and made them change their life.", "Thats great! did yall go out and celebrate?", "Well it looks like you survived!", "Don't give up. I know it can be discouraging when your trying so hard. But it will happen.", "Im not sure if that's good or bad.", "That is very unlikely. Thats what they say.", "Well don't tell me what happens, I might just go watch it all now lol", "i feel you , but you will find someone better and he downgraded lol", "I'll have to check it out this weekend. Anything about the holocaust makes me cry.", "That's so nice of you to help them out! I'm sure they're really thankful.", "Call the police. I would.", "Yeah, It is!", "Wow, any reason for that?", "Well I'm glad you found your friends, that's a terrible way to feel. I've been there before.", "They probably deserve it but you know the old saying two wrongs don't make a right.", "My daughter will be 14 this year. You just made me feel old lol", "I'm the same way. I'll eat them in the car on the way home sometimes lol", "I hope it was all worth it for this moment. Good job!", "Well I'm sure they'll like that and I bet they're gonna miss you too.", "Cool. I love italian. Real italian.", "One day you'll be able to. Just keep your head up!", "I wish I could do one", "It makes me feel better knowing that they get such great care at St Jude's and the parents never get a bill though.", "That is so awful. Was he a the victim of a crime or was it some type of accident?", "Did you ever find out who he was?", "Well that was a good choice then! It will save you some money too i'm sure", "It's hard to depend on it. Don't figure it into your billing. That way if he doesn't pay it can't hurt you.", "You couldn;t stay at work until the next day. My job requires security to walk females out when its late.", "LOLOL thats actually hilarious,  I guess thats why its ex now lol", "OH. I get it. Thats good then", "That will be great. Take lots of pictures, you will want to remember all of those memories you are going to make.", "Yep. That always happens", "On christmas morning, I got everything I wanted.", "All of them?", "In your jeans you did?", "You and me both.", "I wish one day i could see it.", "Haha! that is no good you must have gotten no sleep.", "RC Cola lol. I havent had that is years", "Maybe you should get married!", "Well that terrible", "Thats the way to go about it!", "Call the police", "She sounds like a keeper", "Oh I see. Speeches always make me a bit nervous too... but once you start, it gets less worrisome I think.", "oh my gosh,  kids refuse to sleep, i feel like i kind of do that as an adult too though", "Food solves lots of things lol", "I think they would make my life worth living.", "Lol okay then!", "I did not like college much", "Why do want to fight?", "yes! are you going to a fancy restaurant ??", "Ipack my kids luch", "yeah i can relate to your anger i have kids myself and have expiriencee similar situation but after you will remmeber and laugh together", "Yes! was he a bad boss?", "I know that feeling. Stressing doesnt make it any easier though", "I stay far away!", "Yes! cuddling is I feel an instinctual joy!", "Yes, Im constantly thinking about whats in my food!", "You'll improve what you need to I'm sure. At least the experience was worthwhile.", "That would be amazing! You could skip alot of traffic", "I can not even imagine how that would be.", "Seems promising. What position does he play?", "wow, Thats unbelievable.  Did you let her know it upset you?", "yeah that's pretty scary and gross!", "Yes! I bet it was great, probably really nice weather.", "You can sue!", "I would have left right now!", "how am i supposed to know?", "We can sleep when all of the movies come on together!", "That's cool", "Wow, he was high on alcohol! I hope he didnt hurt anybody.", "i enjoy a little rain every once in a while, but i dont like thunderstorms either", "Do you believe in ghost?", "That is not good,  He need to learn he has to respect you.", "Did you get a trophy?", "Oh my god.  I hate when people are so careless.", "If he won't stop you may need to take a picture of him doing it and then contact the authorities.", "I couldn't agree more,  Sometimes It feels like I was a little kid just yesterday.", "Exactly the same for me. Don't let it bother you too much.", "That is good! just a reminder that you have a father that loves you.", "I say just keep putting yourself out there, cant give up.", "Oh cool, I hope it goes well!", "wow thats crazy", "I try to do that as often as I possibly can.", "if he had other things to do it is ok, but i hate when people  cancel just beacuse they are sleeping haha", "Maybe try a bar with food!", "What was it? Was it clothing?", "God is good to people.  He is always there for you.", "I would have left the entire house!", "They want you to take their medicines?", "Maybe go outside and try and eat dirt.", "Really? Must be some bad peas.", "That changes everyone's life.", "The way you felt should be motivation to keep up the good work.", "yea i know what you mean", "that is a great plan!", "Where are you staying right now?", "I mow lawns for a living, and it is so hot.", "Like in Community! You'll have a great time and I'm sure everything will work out well.", "I prefer New York style pizza.", "well anyways it is really bad on their part that they did that", "Did you get them to recook it?", "i  agrere", "oh thats nice, wish i was doing something similar", "I tend to get road rage and lay on my horn at times like those.", "Good.

Must have slipped his mind while he was hard at work.", "Did you call the police?", "Yeah it is hard for some people to save money, for me it is kind of hard not to spend what i have", "I'm more of a football fan!", "That must of been embarrassing.", "good thing it ended well", "I'm sure he'll love that. It must be quite valuable.", "Are you done growing?", "That is actually nice, i like rock music.", "I'm glad you got back in touch then.", "It sounds like an important film. I love watching documentaries.", "Why?", "What do you write with it? Do you write a letter or a book or a shopping list?", "I am not American so I am only vaguely aware of them.  They are an American new channel is that right?", "Maybe she tried to bring some warm strings in relationship with you", "I am in exactly the same boat. I'm still searching for a new job. It's tough. But stay positive - it might not happen!", "Such a shame. Were you very young?", "Were you the only one who are it?", "lol", "Do you want your friend to change?", "Wow!

What was in the parcel?", "Can it not be rearranged?", "Who is your favorite team?", "My pleasure. It needs to be said.", "i live like 10 min away", "I can't imagine that", "That isn't good. Did you speak to a manager?", "Sorry - I mashed the keyboard. When is the UFC on?", "ive always wanted to go on a cruise", "You will be fine buddy.

That's a relief!", "Do you feel afraid that there might be a ghost in the house?", "Does she know you are going to be better groomed though? Maybe she liked that shagginess!", "I see, time to switch companies!", "I know. Maybe get a cab next time!", "That is aggravating. You should tell him that you need to get a higher pay for your work!", "That's cool. You live in teh future now.", "I wish I could fidn someone like that", "Oh, I guess you got a new boyfie. Chocolates are most often used to show love", "Are they friendly or aloof?", "I understand that.

Big step.", "Everyone farts, man. It's ok.", "Scumbag. Will it be expensive to fix?", "im sure it wasnt as bad as you imagined it in your head unless other people watching the movie told you to hush", "I know how you feel. You don't have to let go of them because the value you place on them can be carried forward for generations and that will make them priceless", "I hope it goes well for you. Hard work tends to pay off!", "Me too", "that is always a great day!!!", "That has happened to me before. So aggravating!", "im sorry to hear that ... hopefully he gets help to deal with issues", "Nice. I suppose you get what you pay for.", "Yes that's the spirit :)", "It is always nice to have someone by your side when you need it", "So sorry about that", "I bet it did. I'm glad you were able to figure out what it was and hopefully you got some sleep afterwards.", "So you just went back to sleep/", "That's too bad, did you at least find your dog?", "makes sense.", "lol", "Yes, well children do have to be better than parents, evolution you know.", "That's a great way to look at it. Stay positive!", "Aww, you must be a very sentimental person :)", "oh thats gonna be a good gift", "That's a good one", "Words of wisdom from him. Will you follow his advice?", "Than I think you have little to worry about.", "Of course it was, but next time you'll handle it better.", "Exactly! but its okay to cheat a little every now and then!", "Wow I'm sorry you went through that. Not your fault, it happens", "Government? No way, it is interested in quite the opposite my friend.", "Nice, I wish I had a friend like that!", "i would also feel lonely", "that is too funny but I have done things like that before as well", "Yes, this things happen, but as long as you find your dog after, it's alright.", "Cool", "What happened?", "You can ask your best friends if they have a spare before spending money on a new one though", "she sounds like a great person", "I have 2 daughters myself and hope that they get scholarships", "Sorry to hear that. Unfortunately lottery winning is a very small probability.", "ah yea .. well thats a good reason", "What color?", "Oh, that is so annoying.", "Try to promise yourself you'll never do that, it should help.", "yea i can see that", "oh, that is unfortunatae", "Hang in there....and remember it's okay to express your feelings", "I think it's so important to not let things like that bother us, I'm really pleased for you.", "You should go out for dinner and celebrate!", "Why is that? May I ask.", "I know how you feel, you don't have to sell it buddy", "wow that's awesome! I am the same way. As soon as I hit complete order, i am counting down the time", "Maybe you could invite some of your friends over to ease your mind a bit.", "Oh thank goodness it wasn't serious.", "i hate seeing dogs alone in the streets", "that stinks", "Awww man!  You are lucky!  That sounds amazing!", "Did your house get any damage?", "At least they are making an album, that's cool.", "Hopefully he opens his eyes soon and realizes what he is doing", "I believe you will be fine", "Do you work for the government now?", "yea i can understand that", "oh ok. it's good to catch up on old times with foreign friends", "Where do you go to meet women?", "that's horrible", "I bet he does! But it was just an accident so hopefully you can forgive him.", "Yeah, those cars are really pricey.", "I am glad to hear that. I hate seeing animals suffer.", "You should talk to him. I am sure he will pick up if you do.", "Oh that must have been traumatic.", "i hope so too!", "hopefully you had insurance", "That sounds like fun!", "Same here... it really sucks", "I hope your dog is found safe.", "well at least you were unharmed!", "Any particular memory stand out that you care to share?", "Oh that must have been nice. It always cheers me up when my kids visit from college.", "that is such sad news", "That is so caring of you! Good on you for being a good Samaritan!", "I would be too. I want my paper on time!", "I hope that never happens again.", "wonder how it tastes", "Yeah, the woods can be scary at night.", "I hope you enjoyed every minute of that. It sounds like a once in a life time experience.", "That's when you know you had a good meal LOL", "Oh thats a blessing. As long as the baby is asleep, all is good!", "That must be really annoying and scary.", "this is true.", "im sorry to hear that.", "Why did you?", "It's nice to work with people who care", "I think you will be fine.", "I hope you can propose marriage to her when you meet with her", "Good to hear. But don't get too overconfident!", "I would be upset if that happened to me. I hope they let you off early next time.", "oh thats good.. dang kid!", "I hope you have a good time.", "I would be too", "Tell me about the fun things", "Well at least you found out easily.", "Yes, cats can be difficult to take care of.", "I though you went earlier to impress a girl", "I could imagine. Maybe I should drop some more hints.", "He must have been very passionate about teaching his students.", "Sucks how customers blame employees like it's their fault", "Hopefully it wasn't something time important", "that's great, congratulations", "thats good...they are usually ALWAYS in the last place you look.", "You'd probably be having even more nightmares. I'm glad you're safe, though.", "Cool! That sounds really special and personal. I'm sure they both will really enjoy that!", "Yeah, maybe you should get her a gift of some sort.", "I tend to like shorter shows that don't have these super long ongoing plots. So I do have a bit of interest but I'm not sure if it's really for e.", "I would confront them about it to avoid it happening again", "Well that does sound like a restful and relaxing weekend. I love traveling on my off time!", "mine does the exact same thing! i hate it", "Yeah that can be life changing money! Maybe next time!", "Old houses are the best.", "Did you go often with your family?", "That must be so exciting!", "I would have laughed lol", "That is so awesome. Does he have a major picked out?", "awww...still thats upsetting", "haha silly cat!", "I would just not do it again.", "I think you should just continue talking over your neighbor. Maybe that will get your neighbor to stop.", "So why does that make you discontented?", "I can imagine it would. You dont need that stress in your life.", "That's awesome! Hard work always pays off!", "So then just let the person know you can't make it. There's no reason to waste that person's time.", "I hope he  or she rewarded you though", "Wow, that is a sweet ride!", "I hope they can fix your glasses.", "i would have been too.. i love my cheese burgers", "That is not good but my mistake happened.", "It seems hard finding a good doctor these days.", "That's good. I try to study well in advance. But I find it hard to actually motivate myself.", "I'm glad you survived lol", "I miss the old times.", "i would be too", "There's always scalpers outside of concert venues. That could probably work.", "Yeah, I'm sure you were.", "hahah...that is natural", "That is very responsible of you.", "you can do it , i pray that you both overcome this situation with peace.", "Oh wow that's tough. Hopefully they don't know it was you at least.", "I understand. Probably, watching a new movie could be good idea.", "I wish there is a way we can make people care more about the environment", "It happens... but you never know their situation and sometimes people make bad financial decisions", "I would have done that too.", "That is terrible. How did you find out?", "It shouldn't have, maybe you need to call customer service and question them as to why.", "I wish you had a higher self-esteem.", "Congrats! That would be really stressful. I'm happy it all worked out for you.", "Did he just freeze up on the test or was it different then the stuff you studied?", "always good to check if in doubt", "wow they should care more that youre safe!", "Yeah, that sounds very exciting.", "Well you can use that feeling to make sure you don't do it again!", "Well that is a good way to look at it.", "Of course, we're not meant to lock ourselves away alone for our entire lives.", "Then nothing to worry about.", "Yes it is. Sometimes I wish you could just go back to that time.", "I hope they catch the person and you get your laptop back.", "That is insane.  Thank God there was someone there to intervene.", "Ah, yeah my husband is the same way. He is very excited.", "Does he seem to enjoy being in the water, or does he resist you a bit?", "That's good to hear. It's all water under the bridge now, as they say.", "Nice, I love those. I have seen a preview for a shark attack movie that is coming out. I think called Meg, I hope to see that sometime", "I am glad you had such a good meal.", "I don't blame you.  A friend like that isn't a friend at all.  I'm sorry that has happened to you.", "That is awesome that she didn't make a big scene of it!", "You could've always come on here and chat with other cool people like you :D", "Oh, that will be so fun!", "I would be too!  Was she at fault?", "Why? Do you want to do like him?", "He must be very smart!", "Sorry that you had a bad experience!", "Yeah, that is going to be a lot of work, and hard to transport to your job.", "OOO Kid Rock that's one of my friends favorites!", "That does suck.  I work at Taco Bell making burritos.", "Congrats you can smile freely now :)", "There's nothing wrong with that and it's a shame people even question you about that.", "I'm happy for you, I hope everything continues to work out!", "how sad.  I am so sorry you had to deal with that.", "Don't feel ashamed. You'll be able to laugh about it soon enough!", "That is terrible. What are going to do?", "I'm glad to hear that no one in your house got hurt. Gang crime needs to be stopped!", "Cliche as it is, time heals all wounds and whatnot. I hope you can find somebody just as great as him or learn to be content on your own!", "You can always try to get a DNA test.", "I hope they do and everything is ok", "Who fault it was?", "That is awful! Hopefully things work out for the better for you!", "I am glad to hear you are okay.", "I hope you have a successful semester!", "Congratulations, I hope you get a raise.", "That's a pretty substantial raise!", "Wow!  I would have been spooked about that too.  What did you do?", "thats true.", "That's really nice of you. Catfish sure sounds good to me right now!", "That sounds like so much fun, too bad those times had to ever end.", "You must be very smart!", "You're pretty lucky to have a boss like that haha", "Yeah, delivery services have really fallen off.", "Did he at least offer to share with you?", "Oh, I understand. Have you talked to her about how you feel about it?", "There aren't many restaurants where I live. Only fast food.", "What an excellent way to start school!", "Oh. Maybe they should lower the fees or up the rewards", "Oh. Well that's lovely.. I suppose. Lol. Maybe you should amend the movie night rules with a different theme every time so they are more constrained to what they have to choose from! Haha!", "I see. I'm sorry you're having trouble with that. Have you thought about therapy? Maybe your health insurance will cover a free consultation or something. Or perhaps you just need a simple routine change, with some exercise and more time outside. I hope you find the answer, whatever it is.", "I'm sorry you had to endure this.", "I hope you guys are able to keep in touch. With that kind of experience, it sounds like it could be a good friend for life. As we get older, we let those kinds of people slip through our fingers. Try to maintain it as best you can.", "That is too bad that you had to learn a lesson that way. I am sorry.", "Agreed - it's very stressful.  I live half a country away from my parents, and I'm worried I won't be able to help when either of them need it.", "At least it sounds like you're giving it a lot of thought. You sound resilient. Most people would just quit or get fired, or not even realize the negative impact it's putting on their children. You seem very self-aware, so I'm sure you will be able to figure out the best decision for everyone involved. Good luck!", "That stinks. I'm sorry about that", "lol I hope your friend understood and they can still meet up or communicate and if things work out it's a funny to tell in the future.", "That sounds really cool. Have fun!", "Is this a roommate situation or are we talking about kids?", "Yes it stinks when things just dont work out, but keep your head up, Im sure you will find someone you like that will be a big help to you!", "That's funny - true.  Hopefully the good part outweighs that, though.", "Sounds like you all should stay away from bars lol. But if it keeps you acting good at home, then so be it. Your friend sounds like he needs a crack too", "That sounds pretty healthy.  Have you always been this health conscious", "I hope things go well for you too.", "I prefer it over the winter if I have to make a choice", "That's nice - it's nice that you have memories like that.  I only have a couple of items from my grandparents, and I treasure them.", "Might have to bring them to the park and tire them out. School should starting up soon.", "Little surprises like that really bring a new meaning to life!", "Yes! I get makeup I need more than half off on those places", "Oh geez! Really, that is interesting, but why would they want too!", "Dang whereabouts do you live man? I'm in South Texas sometimes cops are like that here too", "That would be a lot to deal with. I hope things stay good for awhile.", "That is AWFUL! My mom had that happen too- An old guy hit her atthe gas station and sped off! Seriously not fair!!", "It must have hurt so much.", "Thats so sweet.  He is probably looking down happy you are wearing it!", "Thats good, I just finished studying for a final, And I barely finished in time!", "I understand. Maybe apply at a different bank this time.", "Thankfully. Hearing your story, i am terrified now to even walk in my back yard anymore", "Yeah, there should be, but often there is not really a good option for them.", "Sometimes that's the best way to learn", "well, expect my note too,though it would be a soft copy", "I'm sure you'll meet some cool people if you find a good Pho restaurant!", "What a random surprise. Just make sure its not some creepy stalker.", "I hope none of them found a way home with you.", "Oh no!  I hope you're able to.  I know its hard for kids to look at the longer, bigger picture of life sometimes and just what he's going through now.  I took my GED early at 16 and graduated so maybe he wants to do that and start something else sooner.", "You mean you have a budget for life?", "Maybe she has too much on her plate?", "That is true! But it's part of life, stuff happens. Not the worst!", "I don't trust a lot of people. I do like being alone sometimes but if not then I just want to be with someone I trust- They are not always available.", "Yeah, especially since customer service is usually where companies skimp and don't try to hire or train employees very well. Well, I hope it has a good resolution in the end and something works out in your favor. I'm a clean freak, so I'd hate to not be able to clean properly when I wanted or needed to.", "Still doesn't make it okay. I hope he gets some therapy and learns to be a better dad", "I bet.  I have never seen one up close so that turns my stomach too.  I can't stand seeing injured, hurt, or dead animals. Hope you're feeling better now.", "Good I wish him all the best!", "Yes you can lead a horse to water...but you know the rest", "That is hard..I have been abused and burned...and sometimes you just can't go back..It's like the story of a the girl with the feather pillow..once you say something..you can't ever get it back and it's so hard to repair. Its hard to ever trust someone once they have broken it..I am there myself and don't know if I could ever trust or live with that person again. Life is hard but I am VERY glad you have learned and will treat others better", "That's a really tough position to put yourself in. You would know better than most. I'm a cautious person.. if I felt like there was even a 50% chance of being able to find something close to decent, I'd turn them down. But if you think it's a desert out there and you can't find something to come close, it may be worth gritting your teeth and being there for a few years before you try to move on. I hope it works out!", "I see. I would maybe only bring it up if she wants to discuss. It a hard position to be in.", "Everything to me lol!  Sweet and sour chicken is the BEST", "Hah I know how you feel I love to feed birds and watch them outside my house as well.", "Actually they are, that is why so many die in captivity..They need proper lights and diet etc..I guess if you know how to take care of animals then no- but so many just don't care when they have a pet who relies on them", "Yeah occasionally stuff breaks during shipping.", "I wish you good luck.", "Same here. The humidity is just the absolute worse.", "i had that nothing good come easily", "You think it will be a big success?", "That sounds fun! I'm glad youre more comfortable now.", "Yes, I'm sure you'll be very nice to her.", "I hope you can find the positive in the situation and move forward. Focus on yourself.", "The Bahamas is beautiful. I am sure you will love it.", "That is a great way to make the best out of the worst. Good for you.", "I'm sure you'll get a good grade if you prepared well", "complete family with so much talent", "What's that ?", "I would love to have that happen for me! You are lucky!", "Are you a stylist?", "Congrats! That's awesome", "you should be proud of them. Nothing like family", "Well stick in there and you'll go far.", "Excellent, hopefully you will share some of your wealth with me.", "I wish her and you the most abundant blessings and wealth and success.", "That is great! Were you able to help pick it out?", "yah, safety first.", "wow quite a long time", "That great. Im sure you are real proud of him.", "It's cool, I got fired from my old job 5 months ago...only to upgrade to a self-employed lifestyle, making 2000 a week and hot chicks coming in and out of my apartment every night lol", "just keep working, learning and trying new things, cant go wrong like that i think!", "Well I hope you have fun and I hope she does well.", "At least you made it through allright.", "Well, I hope you can recover from that as time passes.", "Absolutely! I would do anything for my kids too.", "hahahahah, i like the suspense, she is good at giving surprises", "Maybe watch a comedy tonight. That might help out a little.", "I love when they are young and it so fun to see what they learn and discover each day.  When they say enjoy every moment, they are so right!", "Definitely, I wish them the best", "I bet, kids need a lot of eyes on them, but its a catch-22 because you do not want to be too over protective", "I'm so sorry. Do you have a good support system?", "Oh wow, that will help you out immensely.", "Yeah, I agree. we've have to drive carefully.", "Maybe you will win something else!", "Oh good.  Well, at least its a big deal to you because that means you're taking things seriously and concerned about your work.", "That sucks, if everyone pitched in to help it probably would've been cleaned up in record time.", "Yes! Even $5 a week helps!", "Good choice.  Can't mess with a brown recluse.", "Very exciting. I hope you get it.", "Enjoy yourself, if I may, refrain from recording it on your phone, just be in the moment!", "That's amazing. You sound extremely confident!", "Thats a fair punishment, they have to learn somehow", "Take advantage and make a lot of memories with your family!", "It will take time.  Allow yourself to grieve and also doing something to remember your pet can help give closure.  Take care and take a day at a time.", "That's cool. I have worked in a hospital as a nurse before.", "Awesome, I am sure you are proud of his individual effort.", "That's great!  I would be pumped!", "That is a shame, keep your head up and hopefully you can get into it next year.", "That stinks, but I'm glad he's ok!  That must be the scariest thing!", "Did it get you?", "Oh neat. I love those kinds of games.", "Could you call the police?", "So how did you respond to that?", "Dog mostly, cat once or twice.  Possibly human, but I'd rather not think too hard on that.", "Perfect!  Nothing better than being prepared and accomplishing something well!  Great job!", "That sounds great. I hope it goes well!", "Best part about it is you will never have to leave!", "Sounds like you were prepared.  Did you get it dismissed?", "Ahh I see what you are saying. Maybe yall will get bonuses.", "Just be confident in your ability!", "Awesome!  I bet that's a really versatile degree, you should be really successful!", "Hopefully you can pay him back in some way!", "Great, good luck to you!", "Yes, do you ever remember playing in the ocean?", "Well, that's the best you can do, is teach them what's appropriate and what isn't.  I think you handled it well.", "thats nice to know,hope you find happiness together?", "Just keep admiring your child.", "I know I sure didn't in college.  Did you get a job in your desired field?  That's what really matters.", "To clear your conscious", "sounds like fun to me! enjoy the time.", "Good luck in the final stage.  I hope you get the job.", "I understand that. They just give off such bad vibes.", "Stay away from the windows just in case.", "You still have her right there with you!  Its wonderful to know that you're keeping her food and memories so alive!", "I wouldnt let it ruin a good time. Just dont mention it anymore maybe. Im sure you feel a little guilty.", "Oh, I know how that feels. I've done that myself nearly every night.", "I hope everything turns out for the better.", "Oh that sucks. I hope you guys can work it out.", "can i come with my wife too?", "keep up the good work", "I'm so glad that you're happy for her! Start the climb yourself! Maybe ask her for some help?", "Apologize to her. Don't feel guilty.", "You are quite welcome", "Have you ever played yourself?", "I need a haircut soon myself.  I hope you do really well", "No, it's good timing. If you had waited, you wouldn't have been approved for the mortgage. Don't forget to file for unemployment insurance.", "Normal is a great place to be!  There is something to be said for just being happy and content with what you have!", "I can see that. There's a lot to be worried about.", "Should be ending soon and you can go back to your normal life without those pesky calls.", "Too bad, You couldve done something really good to them.", "Well congratulations, spoil yourself with it!", "I can understand that.  It is usually very isolating to move, especially if its away from family and friends.  I did that as well and found I had to consistently get out and try to meet people.  It wasn't always a success but after about 2 months, I started to have things to do.  Keep your chin up and go explore your new city!", "That is great, I am so happy for you!", "its okay", "I can imagine, when my daughter leaves with her friends on the weekend i miss her like crazy too", "So what did he accomplish?", "I am sure, I hope you can get a resolution", "Its never good for anyone.", "I do not think you will anymore", "Yes Fridays are wonderful!", "That is such a great feeling, they must really care!", "it's a rose plant. I'm waiting for the blossom of the first flower in that plant.", "That's great.  I love the feeling of being prepared and ready to crush something!  History can be tough too with all those dates.", "Yea he must be really good then.  7 years is a long time.  I bet you can impress people with your skills", "like some one once said, time heals everything just have a positive attitude", "I can't even imagine what you're going through. I hope your friends and family can help you.", "Ridiculous.  Doctor's think that they are above everyone else and it drives me crazy!", "Oh dang! That's always the worst isn't it", "Yeah. That last year is really important. But I'm sure you'll do great!", "Haha, that happens, hopefully he wasn't offended by it or anything.", "I can understand that.  I mean, you're with them as you watch everything they go through and you start to really like them.  When it ends its like, was this not real?  I hate coming to the end of shows that run for a long time.  So sad.", "I remember being scared the first time I went to visit my great grandmother in a nursing home.  But once you see that they are just people it makes everything alright", "It's normal to be jealous. It is a product of goals not fulfilled.", "hahahah i bet he is a nice guy and will let you see it", "It throws off the flavor of pizza completely.", "I'm sure it'll be fine. Everybody will be in the same boat. I hope it goes well.", "I would do the same if I had something special like that", "she will be fine then!", "Was it a thunderstorm?", "Haha, that wasn't very wise.", "Ohh wow! Well good luck and I hope you have a great time with your friends and school", "Wow, I hope you guys get better if you already haven't.  That's really a bummer to miss out on a family vacation!", "Awesome!  I know, isn't that crazy how much repairs can cost?  Its ridiculous.  Well, happy travels!", "Congratulations! I hope you have something fun planned to celebrate.", "The sounds very interesting, I am sure you could find others like it as well", "but it was an accident on your part so dont feel so bad about it", "Eww. Im sorry about that. That would have ruined my lunch quickly", "Well that's always a plus. Having a good relationship with the company or someone at the company can go a long way.", "He really should.  Some of those folks make really good money just to eat a lot.  Pretty sweet gig! hahaha.", "Wow that's expensive! I hope you can find a reasonable used car.", "It's always nice to get lost in a good book.  One of my favorite hobbies.", "That's awesome!  You are talented! Maybe it'll go for another year so you can save.", "I think those types of situations are rather rare! The medical field has come a very long way. I'm sure you'll be fine and it'll all be worth it in the end.", "im sorry, im sure it wasnt your fault", "That's neat! I learned in college so I've had time to delve into it quite a bit and it is very fun. You choose great!", "I'm sure she'll learn quickly, and she'll be a good dog then!", "That's true, it's like a whole different world when you are inside the park! Very magical.", "can i join you?", "Wow! Well I hope you enjoy yourself and pray before you go on the plane", "Oh wow! That stinks. How are you holding up?", "Stay strong! Hopefully in the future she can have a healthy baby and be able to move on from this tragedy.", "Wow, you're on top of things! Being apart does make the heart grow fonder. :) Make (or carry out) her a romantic dinner when she gets back. Go out with a friend while she's gone!", "Well that stinks. That happens though. Sometimes you do something right and it doesn't show the same result as its supposed to", "I am sorry. You should get some sleep now then", "Maybe you can plan for another time?", "That's really amazing. How generous.", "I hear if you sprinkle red pepper all over your trash area it can help ward off some animals.", "It is a hard balance because they need to learn and it should make you mad, but people do make mistakes.  So hard to know how to act really but things are too expensive to not treat them well.  I hope you're able to find an easier way to fix it.", "That stinks. You should go this weekend?", "Nice. That's a good way to do it.", "That sounds fun, hope you guys drive safe and have fun!", "I dont blame you. I am looking forward to seeing it now", "Great job! I bet the boss was really proud of you", "What a perfect way to end the day!  I'm going to make a big chinese stir fry and watch tv.  Have a great night!", "I think thats a good idea. Look at it as an opportunity to make new friends.", "That's awesome, hope you both have fun.", "Ouch, that always hurts.  I've been through that, and know that sting.  Hope you find a better partner who cares for you!", "Wow, you must be very financially responsible! I'm sure that'll help you do well in life. I'm practicing myself.", "That's all you need.", "well ,you need to consider the option of him not repaying too", "Thats good to hear, always nice to see friends from your past!", "he must be a great achiever", "That's the mindset you need, good luck, I'm sure you will get A's!", "Yay! That's what makes all the hard work worth it. Congratulations!", "That's awesome to hear! We only get one body, we need to take care of it. Good luck!", "I wouldn't change it for the world", "I have a lot of student loan debt as well, I just focus on making sure I pay monthly.  I try not to think of how much I owe", "you need my friend,its just like a success spell", "Wow!  That's horrible!  Don't feel bad though.  She is obviously just a gold digger.  You most likely just dodged a bullet!", "I think that can affect even the best of us, I wouldn't let it get you down.", "haha, yea thats a good way to look at it.  I never thought of it like that", "It is never too late!  You can always adopt!", "haha. it's alot of work but it's rewarding", "that can be so traumatizing. i'm so sorry.", "Haha, yea thats how I feel about my In laws.  Im glad they are a 4 hour plane ride away", "That does sound like a lot of fun.  I miss hanging out with all of my firends", "Yes my friend experienced the same thing recently. It is a terrible thing especially when they make you pay to repair it.", "Yeah, I have heard some people have that! Sometimes after just reading a bunch of information just once can remember every single word!", "Ooo!  Yuck!  I hope you don't get nightmares from it!", "oh goodness. where you able to make it out of there without getting sick or dirty?", "My thoughts and prayers are with you guys.  I hope you succeed.  Make sure you keep practicing", "did you tell him the truth?", "I guess it was a lifetime opportunity too. I'm sure it was an amazing experience!", "That does sound hard", "Ive actually called the police during a situation like that.  I was worried someone was going to get killed", "I know that feeling, I have a brother I don't see as much as I used to.", "That was very nice of you", "its great that you were able to go visit", "well stay inside and stay dry", "That sucks. I've also been through that. Among other benefit cuts.", "well that might make it more valuable to you then.  Does it still work?", "Ah too bad you're married.    Pro's and con's", "I wish people could be more considerate on the road.

It can be one of the few remaining physical reminders of the person.", "I'm not sure if you could train bees. You can get one of those protective suits I guess.", "That is very bad person. You should forget about him.", "You need to keep a cool head though, try doing some sports to relax your mind.", "That's really great for him.

I just saw a tarantula exhibits at the zoo. Even through the windows that made me nervous.", "I'm sorry to hear that", "That's a pretty serious issue.

Time will tell.", "You mean tortures?", "that was really bad", "There is nothing you can do then.", "Well give it back :) Stealing is not right", "That is horrible. He could have even crashed the car by being drunk. How could you let him drive", "Yea, I would find that rude as well, if he cares about the relationship he should apologize or make it up.", "That is really sad. Where was it at?", "Did you get an insurance check?", "It's harder as an adult, but you can make some by joining some adult clubs that focus on sports or recreation. Or, if you have a neighborhood club, joining that!", "That is a smart move by you.", "That does sound really exciting.", "I understand , it feels good but when you are away you keep thinking about home and the kids lol", "Did he walk away afterwards?", "Yeah I understand", "That/s disturbing kiddo..you lied and betrayed then you left. You have much to learn about life and how to treat others", "That's interesting, I'm not sure I even knew there were different types of caffeine. Is one type worse than the others?", "That's a long time, so sorry to hear about your troubles.", "Very sad but think of how proud she is going to make you in the good she will be just fine.", "That is so true. I feel the same way. It's just nice to know that you work hard for your money.", "they are offering a free pass at my gym might take it up", "I am sure it does", "I bet. That always happens to me. At least its gone now for you", "So sorry about that", "You are excited about this or??", "I am sorry to hear that. I hope things get better for you", "LOL! omg..I use that word, I didn't think anyone else did! That is the perfect word for it. I saw a tarantula in the pet store the other day and my skin jumped off of me", "that does sound like a lot of stuff going on at once", "What a great day that must have been for you.", "That sounds so relaxing! You'll probably sleep great.", "I heard of Hamlet that's the one about the prince right I would enjoy to see that being played out in the future glad you enjoyed it.", "That's awful.  That definitely is the worst.  Maybe it's time to change companies.", "Oh wow! That stinks. At least you got new keys", "That's great! Have you moved out of state?", "What a tough situation. Just make sure and document everything.", "You should be really proud of that.", "Damn that sucks \ud83d\ude12", "Would she have any reason not to trust you?  I would assume you have not done anything like this before.", "I can imagine! I have been through it with others. It is terrifying!", "I see, online is such a convenience but if things get delayed or don't work it becomes an issue.", "As long as you trained hard and did your best, that is what counts!", "That must be so scary.  I'm really glad you have some good options to try.", "How much weight did you lose? I have lost over 100lb before. Does feel awesome", "oh i thought you were eating out", "That's true. I would be mad about that as well", "I bet it has. They become a part of the family and it can be hard to let go", "Wow! I bet you had a good time though at your party", "i pay 34 but they are pros", "A new car is a new car :) Just make sure to get it tune ups and oil changes etc on time", "I bet thats rough. I would be the same way if my dog died.", "Have you been back since ?", "that's not too bad, maybe she needs more attention from you", "That is crazy maybe you should check offer up and that is crazy I dislike when people steal what is yours especially something you really need.", "That's great to hear! I am happy for you", "Well, sometimes just following orders really well is enough to impress your superiors.", "What a pain in the you know what. I wish the parents could be punished too. Haha", "It is, but you have got to keep grinding.", "OMG my dream vacation", "That is a favorite of mine too! He was so good in it.", "Thats sickening. Don't steal stuff or you deserve anytime you get stolen from", "Just make it short and sweet.", "Did they get into trouble over it?", "She will enjoy that you are showing that you care.", "Ok well, I would have done the same thing. I am terrified of roller coasters.", "I don't get it. You are not making sense. Is it your overall stress or depression that is making you feel this way?", "Lol! Ah- you must not be irish at all. Sounds good, give me your genes!", "I tell my kids that, as well. It can be difficult and unexpected raising teenagers.", "Same. Ive worked hard this week and now I am ready to just relax", "Yall must have been friends for a long time then.", "Just laugh it off and go back with confidence.", "I'd say you need to report him.", "Chevrolet makes great trucks, as the one you have has lasted this long.", "didn't you at least suspect ?", "Sometimes I want to be like, you are not discreet!", "Well, thats ok. Did you kill it?", "when i was a kid the adults use to scare me so since then i have not been a fan but i will take my kids tricker treating", "It was just a tire he couldve let it go.", "That's terrible. I had no idea", "Good old days of playing these games all nights with my roommates. Now adult life is so different and boring", "That is terrible. What did you do then?", "Make sure you get them done", "Yeah it really is", "just keep your money close to you and your passport closer", "Something has to change. Its very annoying.", "Okay, but I'm pretty sure we aren't done yet.", "Oh wow! That is surprising", "i wish i was you", "And this heat can go away too.", "That's great, it'll pay off for her over time.", "See. They will only hinder the overall performance. You should talk to your manager", "I know. I always get that feeling when I don't win the lottery.", "Everything new is always scary. I am sure you are going to do great! Good luck!", "That is good, glad it will get taken care of", "Well that's awesome! I bet you will have a great time", "Awww, that's precious! Perhaps if I had kids it would be different. They must get so excited about dressing up and going out!", "Im happy for you!", "Oh, okay. Well then it was a nice surprise.", "I understand, maybe you can set up certain times or something", "havent seen her for a while ?", "Adorable so happy for you!", "I see, well hang in there.

Hope she has a good flight!", "I would be too.  I'm happy you didnt get into an accident or even worse, killed!", "Just try and be better prepared next time so you dont get tempted again.", "Nice!

I'm sure it was nice, although sad, looking back at those memories.", "Woah, that's incredible! You deserved it :)", "The opportunity probably won't come along to many times in a lifetime. You should take advantage of it and enjoy yourself as much as you can.", "no partner at home either? work stuff can be really dtressful", "I am also single and there is no one to take me out just to soothe my inner emotional turmoil", "Yeah that's true. I don't let people borrow my car anymore. Too big of an investment", "What company have you applied to?

No pets allowed here", "What type of dog was he?", "I hope you got a refund.", "It did, what were we talking about again?", "Who knows. They could have been like my mom, and maybe they were different and were too ashamed to say anything. Might not have noticed, either. Or they were just bad people. Hopefully you can focus on your pet and how much you loved them instead of those things you can't get answers to.", "Aw, wonderful!", "We haven't really done pies in a while, but my grandma makes a chocolate roll and my mom makes some awesome pumpkin bars.  Do you roast your turkey?  We use a turkey fryer for ours.", "I agree.  I had a cousin living with me for a while until he got on his feet.  I really preferred that over a stranger.

English is a tough subject.", "Well it seems that you have to deal with him for at least another year. With that in mind I hope you have more than one bathroom. I suggest you let him keep his poop in one without cleaning it up until it starts to bother him!", "Whaaat! That was cool of them. If it were me, it'd be torture trying to figure out what to do. Put it into stocks? Savings? Pay off debt? Go on a vacation? I hate making decisions cause I feel like I messed up no matter what I choose.

I don't know why.  My brain is tired from work.", "Haha, that's awesome, at least you two made it out of it safely.", "Was anyone with you?  Did anyone believe you?", "That really is quite an accomplishment.. the type that makes you cry at graduation ceremonies!", "Right, yeah, you just get used to their presence. I hated that they'd bark so much at thunderstorms, but other than that, their little quirks were growing on me. In fact, I miss them right now", "That would be a good idea, it's better to get tested and treated early if it is anything serious!", "I'm sure its happened to him before and understands.", "I know that feeling, I'm waiting for the college to start myself!", "Yes, it's good to keep bonding. I understand not being able to do it at first, though", "Sure does. I think they get a little jealous and just want our attention. They're also very curious about the world, which is a good thing!", "Oh. I know what you mean. I am like that with shoes. I always change my phone", "Did you keep your receipt?  Maybe you can exchange it or get your money back?  ;)  lol", "Fun times!  Makes you think back to being in HS.  I am working in a HS this time.", "I live right next to my campus too! The downside is it's a building made in the '50s and looks terrible on the inside. But I can bear it since I'm saving money. Most college kids have their parents money and just choose a fancier place because they don't care about money.", "Haha, while he builds back up his spider web.", "see it can get worse!  lol... I am paying cash for my classes now but I only take 1 at a time.", "I sort of feel the same way, the older I get, the less I care about my birthday.", "Yeah, he should have left the dog with you so not only would you have some company, but some protection, too. But I don't know all of the situation so I guess I shouldn't say for sure! Hopefully it's not for too long so you guys can get back to being a trio", "I totally get it.  I bet you think about it way more than she does, though I don't know if that makes you feel any better lol", "Maybe they could get funding from the municipality.", "I can imagine", "Sometimes it is worth taking a risk like that to have a high reward.", "I'm sure your family will understand. And look at the bright side, you'll cherish your next visit even more.", "Thats awesome.  Saves time and money.", "Is this your first year working this job? If so, hope it goes well!", "No special occasion then?", "Oh wow, she's must be smart! But yeah, that must be stressful.", "That's so cool! Is it like a best friend for someone who may be lonely?", "Yeah, some cities have a lot of people and some really bad drivers. They're rude and disrepectful to all other people even pedestrians.", "One day when you are successful, I hope you pass your good luck forward!", "Maybe he is trying to do what he thinks is best. I'm sure it's out of love not just being mean.", "So he was ok with it? or?", "Have fun for me!", "That's really nice of you for being nice to her. I bet she is happy that you are her co-worker.", "Yes, there are many times the emotional pain from tragic events are worse than physical. It doesn't make it easier that it was a person you knew, I'm sure.", "You deserve to be happy about that, that is not an easy class!", "That was really shady of them to do that, wonder why they did?", "i bet that brought back a lot of wonderful memories , from the good old days", "Oh I got you, what system is it going out on?", "I hope they returned you with all your bits and parts.  It would be alarming to find they borrowers from you later!", "That's my thought process like every week. I think I might be getting old because sometimes I like sleeping more than being awake.", "Did it at least taste good? lol", "They work really great. Well worth the extra dollars.", "That's great to hear.  She'll be flying out of the nest before you know it.", "Awesome. I'm glad that she has things going for her, and congratulations to you!", "It sounds like you might be from down south. I would miss it there, too.", "Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that, it must have been hard on you", "I would order again also, that's a good company.", "I hope you have lots of fun!", "wow that's great your are so lucky to see it", "I hope you have a good time there.  Be careful in the interior, it's hot as heck there.", "Aw, that's no fun. I bet the constant construction didn't help at all", "Most definetly she was my constant companion.  It will hopefully get easier for us each day", "I agree that he has said some things to suggest that.  However, I do think he has done some good and wouldnt necessarily be the worst president we have ever had.", "Wow!  Now that's one cool gift if I may say so myself.", "Wow, was it?", "Math and science is my strong suite.", "I'd still scorn them for their actions.", "I love that pie!!! It's delicious! My favorite holiday is Christmas.", "I think we need more people like you in society.", "What a relief, right? Where are you going?", "Well, that's different then.", "No way! Congrats!!! I've never come close to that much on a scratch off.  I bet your heart was racing.", "That's great! I like to go dancing too", "You must be getting a big pay raise you ole banker.", "I would be too.  Its not fun when a couple people ruin a night that should be a great time!", "I wouldn't maybe I could get some recommendations for a nice one?", "Depends on what way you're talking about Maybe physics 1 or maybe calc II.  Thats where things really started to come together for how things work +  the math to understand how things work.", "That sounds like a lot of fun.  Did you do this with friends and family or alone?", "Then everything should go fine!  Good luck, I hope you get a raise!", "Sounds like fun. Are you excited?", "Well I am sure you will have fun.  Just follow the instructors lead!", "Well you saved some money at least?", "What did you end up making on the t est?", "Happy birthday! You must be excited", "Amazing, I love Chara", "Oh, well I'm sorry, that is definitely an unpleasant Valentine's day. But, on the positive side, at least you found out what a jerk he was before you became more committed.", "You should go out and celebrate", "How old are your  children?", "They'd shut down then.", "Yikes!  So far we haven't had to dig into the water or food.  I do debate on getting a generator though.", "Sound interesting! It's a cookie or is it cake-like?", "Man I know how that feels.  When I go to visit my sister and nieces, I have such a hard time when its time to fly home", "Don't be ashamed or set yourself short espcially since you worked so hard. If you feel scared or hesitant to do so than I would talk to her boss to possibly set up a meeting.", "I really do not like hockey, it is boring as hell", "That is no good at all, how come you did that?", "Yes, and worse case, perhaps you can carry something on board to help relax your nerves, just in case. There's always alcohol too!", "Got to get him playing some sports for sure.", "You don't even have to do that. Keep it classy. Just show up with a pretty girl and have a good time and be a perfect gentleman.  Dont even bat an eye at her.", "That's really when they start to come into their own. Must be really neat!", "We all make mistakes, just send it back and have it the way you want it.", "It can be hard to find the right therapist, so it's great you have found one that really is there for you and helps.", "I am so happy you have someone so special in your life!", "Oh more money is always good", "I'm glad they came in for you.", "That would be very disappointing and frustrating I'm sure. No doubt you wonder why they would do such a thing!", "Thats true.  Just remember that as much as it might sting now there are plenty of people out there and you want to find one that makes you happy all of the time, not just some of the time.", "It doesn't.  Try hard to stay positive and remember he isn't suffering anymore", "Well, that's okay. I'm sure it tasted fantastic.", "Don't worry, I will tell Hollywood to make new episodes for you!", "Maybe you can borrow them?", "Sounds like it's going to be a good night. Enjoy.", "I'm glad to hear it. It's always nice to get a little me time to get things done.", "Omg..You should get out fast as you can then. Everyone can't be trusted.", "That will bother her more I believe, lol.", "I am happy for you! I hope you keep being friends forever!", "Maybe she will start paying on time.", "Well I'm glad that it worked out for you!", "lol! Well it's ok, it's not like you need to do anything with heights- unless you have to fly a lot. I do..but I don't like it", "Oh ok! I see. Well you're not making trouble anyhow, he is", "That is terrible if he blamed you.", "And your hard work will pay off!", "What happened?", "Well that's nice. Maybe you can pass it don to your kids too", "Ugh, that's terrible.  I hope you found the money!", "Definitely. Hopefully lead to a promotion for you soon!", "When is the test? Practice makes perfect! Fit it in!", "That is a great bargain, Will you use it tonight?", "It sounds like your positivity will bring about something good", "She sounds like a great girlfriend", "i agee. i used to loooove playing mortal kombat.", "I get that, I guess you can just bring cleaning supplies!", "Oh. It's not too late is it?", "Are you going to punish her?", "Wow. That has got to be annoying. I can never finf my landlord", "That is sad. I hope you find them.", "Sounds like a mess, were they punished in some way?", "Oh, I hope you seek help for that", "That is super cool. I hope they win this one too.", "Sorry to hear that", "Cool. I never have time for video games any more", "That is impressive, congrats on raising a smart kid!", "I might check it out. Get back in the game.", "you didn't make them clean it up?", "Cool!  I've heard it can be tough but I think it would be fun to try out!", "YES! I hate it. I can't wait till this dark time in our history is over. Hopefully a few people end up in jail!", "I get that, but I hope that continues for you!", "Well that's good. IT will come it you work for it.", "Oh, well there you go, good choice!", "I probably would have tried to shoot him thinking he was an intruder", "Anyway, you can watch other movies.", "Wow, that is not safe at all for a kid though", "It takes a while to feel that great. I am almost there.", "Best of luck with it, if you hit it big slide a few million my way haha", "Oh, that looked decent, hope you like it!", "What'd he say to that?", "Their toddlers were in the street? I feel like that is almost CPS level issues", "What did you do? Sometimes I just sleep and that is enough for me", "good luck i hope all goes well", "Healing is never easy. It always has the negatives. Any sort of healing always starts with pain, a open wound, and itchy scabs, and the left over scar. I wish I could talk to you daily and help you get through it. I know its hard to go and do things alone. I recently discovered a text number that allows you to talk to someone when you are feeling down. it is 741741. I have used it just recently myself. It does work and is better then nothing.", "I know right? Oh lord- the food industry is the worst, especially for waitresses.", "That's what I get too!  I also get vegan cheese...its delish!  Hope you have a great time chowing down tonight!", "I hope you guys will still get to spend quality time together and of course, get some rest in.", "Oh, why did you go that way?", "Oh I see. I'm glad the police came and took care of it. Sounds like a scary experience.", "Ooof! Best of luck to you, I'm sure you'll be fine. Math was never my strong suit.", "I understand. I hope that they will win again,", "That is smart, sorry that is happening to you!", "Ohh no, its worse than I thought.  It's one thing to relax, but that's different.  What are you doing to whip them back into shape?", "Oh no! that's really terrible.", "Oh, well congrats then haha", "thats cool", "lol. thats an oldie but goodie", "That is so cool and thoughtful!", "smart move", "Well great job, get something nice with it, you deserve it!", "And you might get called a weirdo. Haha", "Well, I hope you have fun! I'm almost completely deaf, so I don't know that much about music.", "ah i am sorry for that! hoping for the best!", "What is the purpose of that!", "That is super cool.", "That is so nice.  When do you move?", "Well that really stinks.", "yea i can see that", "That's awesome! The best part of that is looking good is only just a side affect of being healthier in general, which is great to be.", "I completely understand that. I'm so busy I hardly socialize at all.", "I understand. Anyway, he will keep visiting.", "Oh good luck with that! Next time use airbnb or vrbo", "Wow, she has a bright future ahead of her if that is the case", "If he is rich then I am jealous of him too", "Oh man well wear silver.

Hopefully it isn't as bad for you as it seems, but just know that that mistake has happened to several people that I know of, so you're not alone.", "Wow thats so deep.  I cant imagine having to deal with that at that age.  They mustve been what like 8?  thats a lot to put on a kid", "Why would he even do that?", "Well that may be difficult if you aren't married first.", "Wow that's pretty ballsy nice job!", "How much longer does she have in school?", "That will be so much mush. He is going to have a great time.", "lol.  Maybe they all came into work early just to surprise you!", "That is really good that you get to see them all the time.  Do you have kids, too?", "Oh you just know that there's something going on. That's pretty cool", "Maybe the kids will see all of the trash and see that it is bad and grow up to not  litter?", "It's true, but I also can't help but watch. It's exciting to learn in any case.", "What kind of car did she get you?", "That is awesome.  How far in advance did you have to buy the tickets?", "Nice i love football.", "Maybe you can swap Toyotas for a day :D", "Yeah magic is pretty great!", "I actually started to understand where he was coming from...in a sick kind of way.", "Yeah I can imagine it would be simpler there.", "It's still better that an empty house!", "You have to be careful though.  Sometimes people can be really dangerous when they have nothing to lose", "That makes a lot of sense. Sometime that's just how it goes though.", "I hope so, and I hope you do good in the tournament :) Just rest that finger and let it heal.", "Oh.  That sucks I'm sorry :(", "That is very nice. What are going to do with money?", "I wish I could have seen that sight, ask him for his workout schedule.", "I know you cant ever replace him, but Would you consider getting a new dog?", "Wow that's really rough.

What is your favorite meal there?", "Wow", "That's the bit I kind of don't like about restaurants. I get why they don't let you get your own beverages but at the same time it seems unnecessary to have to wait for someone to refill your glass.", "Hahaha, that must've been pretty funny though. Im assuming he/she helped you up?", "What would you do with friends?", "Yes, don't let a night go by without saying I Love You.", "Man that really does stink!

Glad he isn't scared anymore.", "Was it fun?", "thats cool that you made it through", "I totally get it.

It's good to find someone to hang out with to keep yourself occupied.", "Yes, look it up, it's quite interesting.", "What type of trip are you planning?", "Yeah, or buy pants without zippers. But don't stress it, i'm sure whoever saw it didn't really mind!", "I've flown but not much and never left the country either. I hope y'all have fun :)", "Got anything specific you like to be traditional about?", "Yes, I hate that. I usually end up going back and getting some more just for me.", "Yeah the heat isn't as bad but mix it with humidity and you've got the worst possible combination. Its terrible!", "That's great to hear! My papa is getting older too. It's nice to be able to spend time with him.", "Oh that sounds really fun and I bet she will love it all. I'm jealous :)", "well, thats how fate would have it", "I know how frustrating it can be when we receive so an awful service.  They should train people to do a better job.", "I lost a goldfish once.

I deal with that daily! I am ready to give up on ever cleaning again.", "If it's too traumatic for him, you can always try to put him back.", "hahaha that sounds about how I would have reacted! I once saw my shadow on the blinds in my living room. I sat there frozen thinking someone was outside. Then, I moved and the shadow did too!", "Yes it does, I wish her the best! early adulthood is the best time!", "Oh yes, I know what you are saying. I've never been into GOT but I've heard it's good.", "I hope so too. That is just not right. They could have left a note at least.", "Well,it would be a whole new experience for you", "That would be frustrating. Did it get corrected? Did you still have to pay?", "i can only imagine!", "Don't wish, demonstrate. Do something that reflects what type of supervisor you're going to be. People love previews.", "I get it. It does seem like they are always coming out with another version.", "I can imagine. That's the problem with planning outside events - we can't dictate the weather. You should try planning something outdoors in Scotland, where I'm from - soggy food every time!!", "Well I am no cancer expert. Probably should get a second opinion from a doctor.", "Oh sorry about that I thought you had a dog. Well then maybe the noise the some type of critter. Have you checked under the bed today?", "Yea, it tends to be kinda gross. My teacher had us dissect fish as well and I prefere that much more for some reason", "It is so good to have someone that is trustworthy no matter what you tell them.  I'm glad you have a friend like that.", "That's so sad... The best thing you can do is spend lots of time with her and make every minute count. I wish you all the best.", "Some people prefer to be alone. Whatever makes them happy I suppose.", "I hope you can share it on social media so that the whole world can share in the fun :)", "i am too, i hope we can make a change before it is too late", "No, its fine! Enjoy your day off, I definitely would if I were you!", "That sounds terrifying! I've never been in a car accident, and sure wouldn't like to be in one.", "That is so fun!  Memories are always a wonderful thing to have", "It is good to appreciate what we have, not opine for what we don't have.", "Nice, buddy he will thank you for it when he grows up", "I'm glad he's getting better with his speech and I hope he continues to improve!", "I depend so heavily on my GPS, i don't know what i would have done", "That's great. Some people can go through college and still don't know what they want to do.", "Hmm it's funny how seasonings and spices really alter the viability of a food. Was the buffet all seafood?", "if your happy there i would stay if not seek the better pay in a different town", "Well it will probably never happen again so don't worry about it to much", "Pictures are a great way to remember the past. I treasure every picture. Each holds a special memory.", "They sound like my kids. I hope they start behaving better for you.", "Poor thing had no clue why you were mad", "thats nice", "Yeah get that right.  Make sure you don't fail it four times!", "Good idea. I hope they aren't too much of a handful until then!", "Oh no, that is a long time to be sitting in trash basically.", "i wouldnt doubt it!", "yes I always pay attention to the reviews and peoples personal comments, they can often be priceless!", "Oh, I see what you mean. That's frustrating!", "That is the best feeling!", "Yeah, I would've definitely quit once I saw that.", "I bet! Time to get him trained a little better.", "As long as he remembers to make wide turns. Otherwise bad things happen haha.", "Yeah fears like that are pretty unconsolable.", "As someone who deals with lonesome moments, I know how that feels. I would've totally gone with you had I known you haha.", "next time you go in, put the money of the candy into one of those charity cans", "Nice! I am sure it is going to be a ball of a time.", "Yeah, no need to talk to me about it right now. Think about all the good times you had together.", "I am sure he will be able to help you. I hope you pass.", "Hopefully he'll learn that that's not the place to do that.", "Nah, you can forgo deodorant. The media just tells everyone it's necessary since it's a poorly known method of government mind control.", "You may want to check his diet. Something in not right there.", "Amazing! I would be proud if I were you as well!", "Either way you have the perfect outfit to go on a date with your boyfriend right?", "I'm sorry to hear that. Just take some deep breaths, wear gloves and maybe even a mask if it makes you feel better. You can do this and you'll be alright!", "I know. I don't want to die doing something incredibly mundane.", "as long as you can live with yourself , is all that matters lol", "Oh I get that magazine too. I like it for the stories.", "A much better purchase than the neckbeard's staple. I hope you won!", "That's awful, put the dogs nose in it.", "Dang! Now that is a savvy phone! I have 12 of them.", "Truth be told: I never learned how to ride a bike.", "It's an important tool set to have!", "Nice! I am sure you will pass with flying colors.", "thats really cool", "I hope nobody in your office is the easily offended type!", "Well, at least you filled your stomach. Next time, don't forget about your pockets!", "Wow, hes a pretty smart kid.  He must be reading up on his history and the communist manifesto.", "Awww I would be sad too. Did anyone go and get it?", "That's a great idea. No need to let go of the place you call home completely. I hope everything works in your best interests!", "good luck with that", "Hope you don't have to move again any time soon.", "My dog did that the other day.  I yelled at her and told her that we don't poop in the house", "Oh no! Well, at least it sounded like you and everyone had a good time.", "i would be too", "I bet. I would've been sick.", "sometimes when my friends are annoying me , i tune out ... later o yeah we are supposed to do this today and blah , blah , blah", "My go to lazy-sandwich are fried balogna sandwiches. It's saved me a lot of money, that's for sure.", "I would be mad too. Are you going to sue?", "That amount of poop really does things to a rug. I recommend getting a new house.", "Yeah, if only I could go back and have a crisp apple with some snake oil...all would be right with the world.", "Yea, my phone is pretty expensive.  Im not giving my phone to anybody", "yea i hate clowns too", "Yeah, that is a good thing he found it and not someone else. What are the odds.", "I would be jealous, because I drive an old clunker", "yea i tend to have similar issues", "i hope you have a great time", "That's something that's easy to laugh about after the fact but I bet you were running for your life when it happened! Haha", "Well now i definitely don't want to take the garbage out tonight.  Ill make someone else do it", "understandable, no one should have to go hungry", "That really sucks. I am glad you are okay.", "I am truly sorry for your lots. I am sure things will get better.", "I guess you've been training him and it's paying off? Tell him he's a good boy and give him a belly rub!", "That's terrible but the rug is replaceable.", "his family must be going through some tough times right now , i hope everything goes well", "I absolutely will! Thanks for the suggestion.", "Don't stop believin.  I bet you'll have a great time!", "That doesn't sound grand at all. Hopefully it is a painless procedure.", "Good parents are super useful!", "I wish you good luck with that!", "Did you not have any money to pay for it?", "May I recommend gloves?  Thick gloves.  And a lot of carpet cleaner.", "Yeah, especially since I imagine that is a costly monthly expense. I would install some turrets in your garage.", "Think of it this way. Yesterday I had to clean up my dog's vomit, where it vomited up a used tampon.", "Sounds really fun! I think I will pick it up today.", "Oh sweet. I hope he has a good time in college.", "I could imagine. I don't have any pets. But I understand it can be really devastating.", "That's great! Good to hear you're saving some money!", "I would be mad, we had that problem all the time at the last place we lived.", "Good luck! But be nice - I've confronted people before and totally lost it. I then regretted it.", "That's pretty understandable.", "i know that feel", "Wow, that's pretty far away. How do you feel about him going all the way up there?", "shhhhhheeeeess , that would have given me a small heart of attack or just tunnel vision out of rage", "That's the spirit! The loneliness should melt away!", "That dog probably wouldn't be living in my house anymore!! Did you have it cleaned?", "I can imagine.  My dog used to stain the carpet too.", "Ah, I used to have one of those. Those cars were built to last.", "Yeah I know, thanks.", "the best thing for you is learn from this and do better next time", "Nice! I am sure he is going to be hanging with the popular folk in no time.", "That is all good to know! I'll have to keep it in mind next time I cook it.", "You can just replace him that fast? Don't you need time?", "Flights are convenient though.  Definetly faster than driving somewhere", "I am happy for you and hope you have a lot of fun!", "You'll get there one day.  It takes time and saving", "Lol. We all cheated at some point.  They know that.", "Maybe you should find some new friends.", "That's too bad. Perhaps it would help you heal your troubles away.", "Yup, he's been through a lot", "Why not buy another gift?", "Oh, I'm sorry. At least he was able to make it this time!", "Will you get rid of the cat now?", "Me too! NYC? We should sue and become millionaires.", "Pullups are great! I am more of a pushup man myself.", "Dang I hate when dogs do that crap! (pun intended)?", "I hope you two eat something great next time too!", "oh, damn! I wish I had one of those. That must be super nice.", "That is nice of you to help, but why does she need you to give her money?", "That's good to hear that he was nice then.", "i bet it does", "Yuck, that's stressful enough without having your friend flake on you. Sorry to hear that.", "i hate heights so rollercoasters arent my thing, good luck with that", "Eeep! I think you're gonna give me nightmares.", "Shopping with kids sounds like a nightmare! Thanks for the great tip!", "Not really, but I hope you're alright.", "It's hard for me to wake up early. I have to cut my cellphone usage down or I'll be up all night looking at youtube!", "That's quite unfortunate then. Gotta be more careful with that!", "Yeah. I do remember camping out a few times back in school. I couldn't get used to the pitch blackness at all!", "Oh yeah. Makes for a great game when it's close!", "Well good, let her do all the worrying and you focus on your big day!", "Have you brought it up to her? Maybe she doesn't realize she's doing it.", "I hope so, hope is still alive, and Have you search everywhere?", "Ah, I see. I hope you find someone more respectful and caring", "Yeah they generally have a better chance at giving it more so than large entities.", "Yep, but at least we have the internet to take care of those things.", "i feel bad for you, have you tried asking other people that are near you often to see if they have seen it?", "Wonderful! Good luck, I hope they win.", "I hope you can provide them with some help.", "Yeah, you're right.", "People must have no lives to want to spread rumors like that.", "They can be pretty crazy at that age.", "AOL slow Lol.. I certainly know how you feel! I would have expedited it to me!", "oh sorry to hear that", "That sucks, man. Are you gonna get it fixed?", "Is it something that can recover over time? I hope so", "You'll find someone. You sound like a good person.", "that is true i agree with you, that is not what friends do", "How his your health now", "Have you considered joining any hobby groups to make some new friends?", "im sure it wont take you long with that degree", "That kind of thing always creeps me out.

I feel lonely at times too it's only human.", "Oh you are brave! I LOVE the ocean but I am terrified of being in the middle of it :)", "There's a lot of selfish people in the world, and a lot of impatient ones too. It's extremely frustrating.", "i hate when that happens", "Well, the city probably should do something about it.", "That's too bad. Well I hope it didn't ruin anything special??", "So disgusting to see such irresponsible parents bringing up a child in such conditions. Hope for him to be well", "it sure does feel  good that someone notices", "Yes, that's one way to deal with it.  What did you end up doing?", "Wooded ares are beautiful, until you have to be alone in them, when it's dark.", "Everyone knew he was going to do it though", "i bet it was", "I would feel the same way.

That may help you feel a little more confident.", "i think you are right about that", "He might have a large monthly payment.", "She must have been shy to tell you that", "I've had that happen. Are you going back to get it?", "Kinda creepy then that you are randomly the only one there", "I should get to that as well.", "It was still a nice thing to do", "Im sure she knows how hard you work to provide for her.", "keep up the good work!", "That's sucks. I bet all that food smells.", "Oh Lord, I have forgotten almost everything I learned in Algebra and beyond.", "That's awesome. I know you were happy to receive that in the mail!", "yea me too", "ah that sucks!! bad luck!!", "That is really frustrating. Were you able to claim it on your insurance? I can't imagine how frustrating that must have felt.", "Oh wow that is surprising. Did you guys have a picnic?", "Use thinner which is used for painting , i think that ought to do", "It can't hurt! Just keep on applying, even to job that are above or below your skill levels.", "Oh I have always wanted to do that", "oh thats cool", "Yes defenitly! I see my daughter who is a toddler and love to see all that life in her!", "thats always good when they cant wait to return", "Oh that's too bad.

You must be so proud of him.", "We can't compare ourselves to others. It'll just make you miserable. There will always be someone who is better in something. You could be better at something that someone else isn't.", "If you have the drive for it, im sure you will do great!", "Are you gonna get it repaired?", "So am I.

Why did you move so far?", "I would feel they same way, but that was nice of them!", "Stealing very rarely is worth it, that doesn't stop people from doing it.", "Smart move on your part.", "I know what you mean, I would have been pissed! Probably would have gotten out and throat punched them if they had hit me!", "Wow that's awful, I had lice in school.", "I've never really watched youtube that much, I'm not sure what I'd even watch on there.  But I know what you mean, the content can be pretty despicable.", "Nice! It's always good to sit around a tell the tales of your youth to our children :)", "That is awesome, I mean the gifts are nice, but it's even better to know that you've got people that love and care about you.", "Awwwwww poor little doggie. I am sure she is chasing around mailmen happily in doggy heaven.", "I bet she was so tiny!  I'm glad you found her and were able to take care of her.", "I bet if you say anything about it, you're the bad one too", "I am sure you'll find somebody in due time. It took me 6 years to find someone after my last relationship, but it happened. It'll happen to you too!", "Here is an idea. Why don't you get yourself a teddy bear by your side when sleeping. He will protect you", "Yeah I understand.  Is there anywhere you can take it to get it fixed?", "For what? Hallowscream at Busch Gardens?!?!? If so, that place is a blast.", "I sure hope you get to keep your job.  I know it was a big accident, but it was an accident.", "That is a real bummer.  Maybe you can have a makeup vacation in September.", "that's just nice of you!! helping out your sister!!", "I bet! You deserve to be proud and excited though. You have worked hard for this.", "I can imagine. Glad you are both alright.", "And that's the best part. Many of those folks with nice houses have mountains of debt. It causes a lot of stress.", "Yeah, you'd better find him like quick!  Or flood your house until you do - either way..", "That is such a unique name I love it.", "i think it becomes a practice for him!!", "Man, I am truly sorry. If I knew you, I would definitely help you out.", "I hope everything works out for you, I know how hard shut downs can be.", "And you're doing something amazing!", "I really hope that it comes on time.  It can be so disappointing when something like that ruins your perfect plans.", "Hopefully this type of situation doesn't happen again. That really is disappointing how the system doesn't protect the employees about that type of situation.", "That is amazing I guess she deserves to be spoon fed!", "i hope you have many more", "Yeah, I've had them do that to me before too. It's a pain in the keester.", "LOL....Their waiting for you to let your guard down and then they will attack you.", "I am glad to hear you are alright. But I would still be on the look out for next time...they are the relatives of godzilla after all.", "I hope he keeps it up!", "That is a major issue.", "That's great man. You just have to wrestle a few sharks and they'll appoint you head lifeguard of the state.", "It is hard to recover from a binge like that, but do a few thousand situps and you'll be good as new!", "That's good to hear that you and your co-worker mad amends. Live and learn!", "That's okay to give in sometimes and enjoy the moment.", "Oh, that must be stressful. Do you think he is going to be fine?", "That's so terrible. How could they ditch you!!", "You should write a good review, sounds like they know what they are doing.", "Well, as long as you did and the wife doesn't know, you're in the clear!", "Well, that's kinda meh. But congratulations still!", "You must be feeling great.  What are you studying?", "I have sailed all over the glove. Hit a couple of countries in Europe, a few scattered islands across the Atlantic. And the best part is, I've never been deployed! So I am truly living the dream that every sailor hopes for lol. I was very fortunate.", "No doubt he will when he gets cold and hungry.", "He will be rich one day!", "I would be too. Did you tell the manager?", "That's awesome!  Did it brighten your day?", "Wow that's awesome! To the beach?", "What did you study?", "I've never been a phone of Apple anyway. I had the first iPhone and wasn't impressed so I never tried again.", "Why don't you take them to Six Flags. It is more fun and full of exciting experiences rushed with adrenaline", "Wow, that's amazing, haha. So fancy.", "I love going through old memories and reliving the glory days.  Are you still friends with some of the folks you knew back then?", "Maybe you should go on a diet so you don't feel sick :D", "It would be nice to have money like that.", "Good you should be for having such a blesses neighbor", "That is crazy!  Most kids first words are money.", "That's great! I go there almost every single day and get a bread bowl!", "We'll get back on the horse together, my friend. Skinnier days are ahead of us!", "It's really cool to have those moments where you get to enjoy what you like to do.", "oh oh. It's alright next time you should be bit careful not eat a lot", "Well, I guess it didn't turn out too bad. Are you guys going for another?", "you must have really enjoyed it", "Ugh. The horn is the worse! Especially those loud, obnoxious semi-truck horns!", "That is pretty unfortunate. You should be like me and just buy them, always easier when someone else does the work.", "For sure. That really isn't something a normal person should be doing. Or anyone for that matter.", "They would be very jealous!", "Awesome!  Where are you going?", "Maybe you should find out who did it and go throw toilet paper all over their yard!!", "omg!! millionaire that works at McDonalds. I would like to see you work", "That's really rough. Maybe you should go to the gym and meet some friends?", "You seem to be very fed up with him. How long have you had him?", "Truly unacceptable. We would be better off with chimpanzees in office.", "I am really amazed.  Was it you?", "I agree, your talents would be better suited elsewhere.", "It's like 100 degrees during the day, you would have had to find a pool to jump in.", "Nonsense! If you're a zombie, you'll be brainless and the scar will be the least of your worries!", "You will nail it. Just be confident and just be yourself!!", "That's great man. At least you'll have a place to stay for the next month.", "That sucks man. Do you have another grandma who can give you a new one?", "Naughty dog. he should look after himself", "Nice. I have my eye on a Tesla.", "Just take deep breaths and act confidently and you'll do great!", "I don't blame you, but we have to help our struggling siblings out!", "Mine died a couple years ago and I still think of her. :(", "Nice! Perhaps I can go buy a car on the website one day!", "That's the coolest thing I've heard all day", "What position does he play?", "I am sure! Please let him know that I am game to come over for a pool party!", "I'm sorry to hear that. I hope he can get the help he needs.", "I once chased a fly around my room for 30 mins, never caught it, I think it was all in my head?", "I do hope you rubbed it into your co-workers' faces like I did!", "They definitely will get you a rum cake", "That sounds alarming. You better be careful next time visiting the place. They maybe careless with their sanitary responsibilities", "Thats too bad. I am sure it makes things very stressful and difficult.", "I feel sorry for you. I just hope you guys atleast meet now and then!!", "Just be a good husband and you should be fine.", "Oh thank goodness you weren't late.", "It can really be annoying when someone tells you what to do.  Have you talked to her about it?", "Mmmm, I love that brownie smell.  Also nothing better than fresh brownies.", "Hey that's great!  You should take a before picture today and an after picture one month from now!", "I would be terrified too. You have to do get it checked out!", "don't be !! you will do well. Just be yourself!!", "maybe you should lay out some bait, he has to get hungry sometime.", "He sounds like an excellent boss!", "I'm sorry.", "I am sorry that you now live in infamy. Maybe, with time, they can learn to forgive you.", "Just make sure you focus on getting good grades!", "I hope it all turns out well with good news there!", "omgoodness! I don't think I've even used flamingo in a sentence myself in a long time! He's clearly a prodigy!", "That's so cool! Sounds like a store you would find in Daiagon Alley!", "I'm sorry you didn't grow out of it.", "I would have done the same. Never know if the thing is going to bite off your bellybutton or not.", "Sorry to hear that! Definitely need to make sure it doesn't fall off!", "Nice! What kind of pizza was it?", "Aw, that's adorable, sounds like you guys will have a great life together!", "better hop on the elliptical for a little longer tomorrow!  Worth it!", "Oh no, that's awful. Maybe you can find something else to give her for her birthday but tell her you have another present that will arrive a little later.", "Hope you enjoy it!", "Yeah I'd be tempted to barf myself witnessing that.", "She must be really smart!", "Well you are ahead of the game, more so than most people.", "I'm glad you gave him a chance to shine! Everyone deserves a chance to be trusted, and it's good on you to roll the dice!", "Ew, that does sound gross.  Was it some sort of bet or that's all you had?", "Oh I bet.  Make sure to hang out with as many people as you can before you leave!", "Make sure to give your wife a big present when it is her birthday!", "I hope you threw it out!", "That looks really exciting!", "Those are the good old days. Have to use coupons these days!", "Maybe you will win next time!", "I don't think they know about mufflers! You should try white noise and black out curtains.", "Whew, I would be too. God knows if she messed herself.", "Yeah, they should never find out.", "I would be furious, they are expensive now a days!", "I hope you have better control next time.", "My cell was out of range and it was dark out. My daughter was not happy. I am glad you got help.", "I am sure with your care, she will be much better off. I wish you and your family well.", "I hope it isn't anything serious.", "Ohh yeah!  That sounds awesome!  Is it a contest?", "I wish I had your drive.", "I admire engineering work. The true pioneers of society's good", "all police not bad", "We all use a certain brand here. Now, if you used my toothbrush, that would be fighting actions!", "It's like losing a family member... I hope you can find another shop like that someday.", "That looks like a fun movie!", "Well, I am sorry you had to witness that. Admittedly, it", "Why you guys don't you deliver a complain note to the management. They are responsible for handling the office tools", "Oh I see.  I bet it was a sad day then.", "I hope she is careful with it.", "Awesome, I'm happy for you, good luck!", "I hope you have pet insurance, you never know what can happen.", "You could, but it's always a gamble!", "I hope you get married!", "ok carry on", "I agree. I really hate driving off only to find out a third of your order is wrong or missing!", "If he does then he isn't a very good person.", "I agree, some people just don't care about anyone but themselves. It's sad.", "That sounds quite scary.", "Maybe one day you could repay them?", "Then it sounds like you have two things going for you; an A+ and some new found confidence!", "Well that sounds like you have prepared for sure! Hope all goes well!", "Good play, I probably would of done the same, haha.", "You seem like a very good friend.", "That's really cool. Have fun building the dresser!", "On the bright side you can buy a new vase to replace it!", "He sounds like a fun kid!", "Yeah, well at least it didn't break the bank, things happen.", "I hope you can also visit her there if you get the chance!", "I know. My advice is take it seriously just in case", "Sorry to hear that. Maybe you and the other tenets can lobby for additional parking somehow?", "It's such a great joy to win something. I hope your luck continues.", "Well, maybe try meeting some new friends? Someone a little closer, perhaps?", "Hopefully you can teach your friend to copy your behavior!", "I can't wait to see it now!", "The world is not fair.", "I haven't had any in a while, but now I suddenly want some!", "Something about watching the world's best really keeps me interested.", "Yeah, gotta be careful and give them their space", "Yeah, and it can stain. I drop my coffee more often than I am willing to admit.", "Just don't get too close! You never know what can trigger them", "And the snow! I'm excited to start skiing again", "I really love snickerdoodles!", "Singing is like any other skill. With time and practice, I bet you can really tune those pipes!", "That's a good start, just stay motivated and focus on learning everything you can. You should pass the test easily.", "Oh that's so nice! I'm sure you're a great coworker and employee", "Always stay faithful, it is the best thing for your relationship.", "I hope that never happens again.", "take it easy, did you find your way out?", "That's too bad, small places are usually hidden gems for food", "It's embarrassing in the moment, but I think there are more clumsy people all around us.", "what time is the trip", "Was he ill or was it sudden? Either way, it's still painful.", "I would have probably felt the same way as you. How did everything turn out?", "Great! I hope you have fun and remember it for a long time", "Where do you think it can be?", "Yes! Whats even worse is when other people don't pay attention in bad traffic!", "I wish your friend could teach my dog a few tricks!", "Fine. Have a joyful life ahead!", "Ohh.. I see! I'm sorry to hear that. I've never had the personal experience of having to do so, but sometimes people really have to argue and advocate for themselves to get the things they feel they've earned and deserved, like a salary raise. I hope in the future you can do that so that you can feel like you're getting what you've earned.", "Definitely, I'm not a super clean person but that's a bit far.", "I hope you get a fresh start elsewhere!", "Yes! Do you keep your favorite things of theirs? I always keep my favorite outfits of his and donate the rest!", "ha ha i understand its creepy but then again my mother kept her mothers glass eyeball so i guess nothing would surprise me anymore!", "I bet! What are you going to school for?", "Hope! you'll get a good reply!", "Give him some time. I'm in counseling and it's taken about a month for it to really help.", "Hopefully this will work out well for everyone involved.", "That sucks. Why did you wake up late?", "I am sure it was a great time!", "I was proud of my mom when she started focusing more on her weight, too, just because of what you said--she's getting older. I wish she could live to 150, so anything that helps her live longer, makes me really happy. Good for you for making that choice sooner rather than later.", "I understand and i seriously think finance should be taught in school at a young age but the banks do not want that and will fight to keep that class out of schools", "That makes sense, but yeah, human error is a very real thing, which is why self driving cars would probably be an improvement", "Well, it's always so annoying in the beginning, when you know you have to change, but to see how much work there is to do in order to reach that change. It's hard for people to break things up into smaller pieces so it's not so daunting. But congratulations to you for reaching a happier place", "Neat! Well that is a fantastic feat. Maybe you can win again sometime?", "Whoa that sounds incredible. You are very lucky to have witnessed that.", "Well, remember that he is doing something healthy for himself and that should make your relationship stronger in the end.", "I hear you :) My mom is like that. It means you're a great nurturer.", "Oh man..TN has water mocassins I think- Be careful!", "Oh yeah I know it. I have to work remote sometimes and, depending on the mood, loneliness hits hard.", "I will have to look into those, they sound like a really good investment.", "Oh my god! I would contact your city or DHEC. I bet if they started to get fined they would clean it up!", "I am sorry to hear that, I hope you are able to succeed eventually!", "Good, I am glad you like the new change!", "Oh okay thats good! Mine went across the country to college last year, so I get emotional about that.", "Thank goodness the outcome was good. Everyone needs something on them to deter someone that might be wanting to harm you.", "Wow that's quite the collection, you must be pretty experienced.", "You could always give it a shot for a few weeks. If you don't like it, you can try for new opportunities.", "Are you going to go out with his sister again?", "You also need to cancel any credit cards.", "No, I understand. It's really stressful and someone needs to do something about it.", "That's good advice! I will try to. In general I don't like talking about myself, or having attention put on me, so that's partly the reason birthdays aren't my thing either. But it's good to have people who like theirs", "Lots of positives!  I'm sending good vibes your way!", "Oh wow, well I'm sure he's going to be a great father! That is such amazing news!", "I will take that offer, I could eat pork shoulder every day.", "Awesome, I hope it is all worth it", "Yup. I heard it's all of them and it will be the biggest smash ever!", "That's true. You must be a very good mechanic to do all that - I know the amount of work it takes!", "Well no worries then", "Oh that is true, but maybe you could leave the kids home with babysitters. That does sound fun.", "Well, I might leave him a surprise in the fridge for the next time he comes over. Some Ex-Lax chocolate pudding or something.", "Exactly, it makes being happy tough sometimes", "Excellent! Thyroid issues are easily treatable though they can be a burden to deal with. I hope you feel better as soon as possible!", "I would be terrified! It sounds like you have a good system to deal with them!", "My mother used to do that when I was young. I hated it. hurt so bad with her long nails.", "Oh that is a ways away! Can you preorder?", "Oh, well if he is flirting, I would dump him", "Well, I hope you can get that stuff taken care of, I have had lots of trouble with money in my life. Takes a lot of hard work to fix it.", "Exercise is a good thing at least.", "well you are a rare breed.", "That was kind of you, so hopefully it does not backfire", "I hate when management does that. I would ask you if they are compensating you for overtime but if they're already treating you like this, then I doubt it.", "Wow, that is fantastic, good for you guys!", "Cool. I have an xbox one x", "I would say let it go, do not bother with it", "I like that it is not too hot and not too cold.", "That's so tragic. I'm very sorry.", "Yeah but, a lot of them won't come back. Once they graduate they'll move off and start their lives.", "We all need time to relax and recharge.", "You might have better luck when you go to court about it. The judge should be understanding. Its a common mistake", "I wil give it a shot some time then!", "Are you moving in too another apartment or a house?", "Yes the colors are so beautiful in the fall and I love the fashion look as well let's cheer to fall almost being here lol.", "I took a trip to europe once.  Once you get used to riding the rails and traveling around it's a blast.", "Thats awesome. Enjoy it.", "Well, I hope you can get through it ok :)", "I bet, just take breaks and see if you have any friends that can lend a hand.", "Ah, that seems reasonable, probably better to take it slowly.", "Oh nice, what kind of party?", "Sometimes they enjoy being able to get around on their own even if it is dangerous.", "Well that would be good for commitment etc..but not good when someone says no about something like this", "You must be worried sick!.  I hope everything is ok.", "What a relief. That probably frightened quite a few people too. I'm glad that the response to it was prompt.", "So true, they are very observant and watching/learning even when you don't realize it.", "Lol, that might be a bit extreme.  Maybe selling parts of your body, like plasma?", "They do, but sadly that is part of life.", "I watched all of those. Clarissa explains it all, are you afraid of the dark, cousin skeeter...", "No. I have to admit canned tuna is not one of my favorites. Did you watch this on TV?", "That's what happened with me and dogs. I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you can find a different animal companion!", "That is a great school, what does she teach?", "That sounds pretty spooky. I am glad you made it out alive.", "Were you being jealous?", "What great ages!", "Will coming out with it be as bad as if you were caught ?", "Yuck, I used to live in a rough area and that kind of thing would happen. It gets really old fast.", "Oh yeah! It is cool here today but it has been insanely hot. Pools are the best.", "Garbage smell is the worst. It's like this specific sweet sick smell found nowhere else in nature.", "Bring someone with you that could be emotional support", "Have you tried to find a counselor? That might help you to get through it.", "What a fantastic surprise. Hope she keeps progressing.", "Is it something you can do yourself or does it have to be done at a shop?", "Well, maybe I'll be seeing you on the television one day!", "What is your major?", "Wow! I bet that was a scary thing to experience,", "I bet it will be a great time and fun!", "i guess thats true", "I'm sorry you're going through this.", "me either. that;s no preparation for the world", "Oh geez!!! Was it in your own yard?", "I'm sorry to hear that, I think you have the right positive attitude though.", "You will be awesome glad it is something you are exciting about doing good luck.", "lol!! That's a hysterical name! Never heard of talking heads. What genre?", "That's too bad. We get a lot of gunshots here too and no one comes to help.", "No you don't have too. Little kids can just play with toys and not on video games. It's not good for them really.", "Thats so true", "that would have been so cool! Get one next time if you can. :)", "Oh, I see. Were they making fun of you guys?", "yea i wouldnt touch that no matter how much they wanted to pay me heh", "Sounds like fun glad you got to do enjoy yourself", "Jesus! I hate opening my mail already because it's bills, I can't imagine trying to do something that ambitious which in of itself is a lot of work to get a business started and you have to learn so many different things, and then on top of it being sent stuff like that. Agghh! I hope it ends well for you, though.", "Thats a job that is needed for sure. You could also try and get a degree in programming- it usually only takes a year? So many things you can do. Also look into selling online. It's a great business if you stay on top of it daily :)", "True, is it a fun place too go?", "Maybe they just don't notice it.", "thats good", "now that is impressive", "spray the hose in that direction to get the tv wet.", "I would have been terrified! What did you do?", "Yay!  I had a little box turtle when I was younger, I liked her a lot.  I hope Mrs. Lee has a long and happy (and not thirsty :)) life with you!", "Phew, that sounds like a lot of work! You better start getting on that, then!", "Some don't like them. I can't do the ones that go straight down.", "I'm so glad! When are you due?", "hahah stripped sounded so much better but okay tripped! I gotcha", "Next thing you know she will be walking.", "Sounds fun.  I hope you had a good time!", "Oh, I feel terrible for both of you. Your hard work lost, and she probably feels really guilty too, for something that was maybe an accident. I hope you guys were able to talk it out and not get too upset with one another after a while.", "Just hit the gym as soon as you can and you will feel better!", "Yeah, I can understand how you would feel embarrassed there. It sounds like it didn't lead to anything too bad though, so maybe most people don't remember it happened at this point.", "Yes the juice is certainly worth the squeeze", "Enjoy it! You deserved it :) I hope you will get more checks like that", "i agree with you! I don't know what i would do without God.", "You were just in the moment, I bet it wont happen again", "Wow. I bet that's going to hurt him later, though.", "Its too soon to be homesick!", "Good for you. Good luck. Just remember to have a good time and you will be fine.", "Absolutely. There are things far more important than lawn length.", "What is she going to school for?", "ohh i mean maybe you can go and give it a try and see how he does", "Oh, I see. That makes a little more sense. Did everything work out, or are they still gone?", "Cool, well have a good time theifing!", "I feel you. Watching the leaves change colors makes me feel peaceful.", "oh that was nice", "I recommend taking some time to explore the city and find an hobby or interest and join some groups. It takes time to find a new set of friends.", "Hopefully something similar will come up soon. Maybe you can check for another position in the company you're hoping for!", "thats the law!", "Then you'd get in lots of trouble as most places have laws that your dog can't be on the loose", "I am sure you deserve it. That is fantastic.", "Okay, I get it. Ever seen the movie Hostel?", "Is it physical? If you need anything let me know.", "I understand. Is it a very nice watch?", "sounds like the start of a business", "Make sure to enjoy it to the fullest.", "If you kno", "Behave on your vacation :)", "Keep focused! You can do it! Being debt free is an amazing feeling!", "thats always good", "Well hopefully you can go soon", "that sounds interesting", "That is awesome. Kids here start tomorrow so I know the feeling of being ready for them to go!", "It's just not worth it.", "i agree with you there.", "now how nice of you!! thats what  are friends for. I Hope you will get a job and your friend will get a gift!!", "Good for you. Buy yourself something special.", "You will still have plenty of time before your son becomes an unruly teenager.  Cherish it.", "Most definitely! would you say you live in a good neighborhood?", "I bet she loves you for it either way! It doesn't matter how little the effort was, it matters if it was nice!", "Haha! I'd need a lot more than a free tshirt to eat a 3 pound burger!", "im sure it will make you feel better.", "That's so annoying. Maybe you should leave earlier next time", "Well, what kind of prank was it?", "thats what im talking about!", "That's awful, what did you want to do?", "Yeah. Oh to be a kid again and not have to deal with all that! So sorry you're going to miss time with your family. Hopefully they'll take lots of photos!", "oh well good luck", "What a jerk, I'm sorry that happened.", "hahaha hope you have fun!", "As long as it has good reviews, make sure you put a little squeeze of lime in it at the end. It really brings out the flavor. right before you serve it tho.", "my mom doesn't lol but she is crazy about healthy vegetarian food ,so :)", "Chemicals mean serious business, but you landed the job. Good luck with doing well.", "I wish you a lot of luck, and try not to let it get the best of you ( way easy to say... way hard to actually do. i know )", "I would be too! They should be more diligent with their shipping estimates!", "That is awesome, I hope it goes well", "Well that is good for you then!", "Summer is my favorite because it means vacation!", "We've all been there...at least I have.", "I would defenitly just have her block the number, so he gets the message.", "Nothing to be nervous about, I'm sure you'll do fine!", "that is what i love the most about Thanksgiving the food is always the best", "I hope you do too! Applying is a huge step in the right direction!", "I hope you can get it all cleaned up without too much trouble.", "That is really crappy, i think whatever makes you feel that way you should try to figure it out and battle it! You deserve to be happy all the time.", "That would be bothersome, especially if it's taking away from your time.", "That is very cool.   I like tech that is practical but also fun to use.", "Have you had any kids yet?", "Congrats, I've heard that many twins have a special bond so I hope they have that and do well.", "That sounds like it would do the trick. Hopefully his couch is okay.", "lol, did you tell your friend about the hair?", "I hope you win!", "No, it wasn't you, obviously. Your previous manager sounds like a control freak!", "Did you talk to your manager?", "Okay, you know you can buy them too. And somebody lost for your gain.", "Blood makes me freak out too. That is pretty scary! I'm glad they are okay.", "Oh that's awful. I am glad you and your stuff is okay though!", "That also helps relieve some stress off of you trying to get everything ready by yourselves.", "It will feel like old times for sure", "Of course,  that is fantastic!  Congratu;e him from me.", "I bet! It takes quite a level of talent and composure to perform publicly like that. Kudos to your daughter!", "Yes meet new people!", "well you probably should start paying much attetion if you dont want to risk it", "Oh, I understand. Maybe they make up for it on busy days, like weekends.I hope they stay open so you can continue to enjoy their food.", "Thats unfortunate, I am sure they will forget", "Sometimes you don't know when they'll pass unfortunately. I hope you take some time to grive.", "Did you put any money in the collection pot?", "Did you cry yourself to sleep that night?", "That's really nice. I hope it was a big raise!", "That's good to hear. But kids can be a handful when they are sick.", "Oh man, I would fall asleep in that", "Do you have some bills that you can put off until later?", "I can understand that for sure.", "Oh, I've never seen that. It sounds amazing! If they're anything like the F1 drivers they'll be incredible!", "That's awesome, I hope he enjoys it too!", "Amazing! That had to be really stressful too though", "dont worry about it it happens to everyone it is nothing to be ashamed of", "Did they apologize to you?", "That's awesome that he is helping to break the mold then. Says just as much about him as it does about you, though. Takes good parenting to get him to that level of motivation", "Yeah, I wasn't careful about what I ate when I was younger, and I'm really paying for it now. Hopefully they can get back in shape too.", "I'm sure that's an awesome feeling.", "I see. You'll find balance along the way though.", "I can understand that. And I live in the south, so it doesn't get that cold, so I can't really complain. I visited my girlfriend who lives in the midwest last winter, and it got under 0 at times. I could not live like that long term.", "Probably they just fell bad for you, thank god it was not worse.", "My girlfriend has complained about rats too, since she lives in the midwest.

Just try and stay productive as much as possible.", "Nice! Make sure to take lots of photos and make some cool memories together!", "I know, and I know it can be really hard to deal with that guilt.

Don't lose them for your life!!", "Yeah that's pretty unacceptable. As a former teacher myself, I can assure you that as much as I loved those kids, my kids would always come first no matter what.", "I am sure you'll reach your goal one day. I do hope you get that brand spanking new car.", "did your girlfriend like that", "That's great!

I do hope that they find the cause.", "Are there any favorite tunes that it plays ?", "okay do it continue, it will clear", "Yea, that's a really emotional one for a lot of people.  I see that one mentioned a lot for tear jerkers.", "Oh man. Well, be careful out there. Wouldn't want anything to happen to you or your family.", "Hahaha, me too definitely", "Sounds pretty cool.

I worry everyday about my school age kids.", "You can always try again tomorrow", "I believe its out there for all of us, we just gotta find it.", "Did you put your phone number and things on the sign?", "I certainly would. How can you jam out to all the NOW CD's without it?", "Well, in that case it's better that you just relax.", "Why were you not sleeping", "if you studied really hard then you should", "I'm not sure what that means, but you should talk to him about it!", "Cool.", "I am sorry you felt that way.", "Yeah I would to if I was in your position.", "Is her litter box full? My cat does that when it is too full and I neglect to clean it.", "I feel you. Last time I did that I was late for work...I hate it when it happends.", "Eh, it's okay.

Some people are pigs.", "I don't think that 's very healthy.", "you only get one family", "ah that sucks!! but you can't help it. It's your friend's decision", "I would get up in her face and show her who's boss. Break out the broom and crack it across her old, measly back!", "I think I'd look into entering some eating contests if I were you!", "Good luck :)", "What type of diet are you following?", "I bet! I would be too scared to even try!", "I am sure you will get better.", "I think that as a bit harsh!  It wasn't like you did it on purpose thinking it would be funny or anything.", "You might want to find a new job", "I know exactly what you mean! All the old flames, the old rivalries, everything is like it was yesterday. It's a pretty cool feeling.", "Oh wow. Well good for him! I know that makes you happy!", "I know how you feel. I've had shows that I've loved that have ended and it's like losing a best friend.  I'm sorry it's ending.", "oh I only have a few more years with mine too", "Yes he could be! Maybe you should check under the bed right now. He could be watching you.", "I would remove him from your family tree. That will show him.", "Yeah, maybe have a talk with her. Or maybe think positive, she might be getting you a gift? Haha", "Ugh, Its such a weird brain function.", "lol. Hopefully that will be the last one you run over.", "Sounds like the right move. Good on you for standing up for yourself.", "Aww, that's sad to hear. I hope you didn't lose too much sleep!", "Ah, makes sense. Just drink milk everyday and it should be fine in a week.", "Ah. What a terrible inconvenience!", "Yikes! That must have been terrible", "Oh, how did she look? Still pretty?", "thats a nice chunk of change", "Hm.. judging from your conditions, maybe McDonald's isn't the best place for your to eat anyway!", "you will be a great motivational coach. Such positivity !", "I understand. But you are human!", "Oh no, I hope you can get the shoe removed from your foot.", "Oh okay well that sounds nice.

Very fun and uplifting.", "Yeah they're all pay to play, I think you should be able to play the whole game the first time you buy it...", "Why you don't have a choice?", "You should call the police on him.", "I truly respect and admire those people. They are the most beneficial members of the society", "Oh yeah, that's not great. Next time make sure to say no directly to his face", "Then I know you will do great! Good luck!", "now you have me excited too", "Hahaha, well she found the one I guess", "I would be grossed out too", "It is good that you care about that too.", "yep, its the not knowing that gets to you most.", "I am sorry.

A little girl will be a great addition to the family", "No, he truly is lower than a dog himself", "Now, that is scary!! Without power for days would be a nightmare", "The thing I don't like is that the HOA monitors that type of stuff.", "Oh well I'm sure they didn't judge you, it could happen to anyone", "that had to be a long time ago", "then you should instigate something in school!!", "That's ok, I did not know much about it", "You should then wait for it. Not sure how much time it will take though!!", "I don't believe in god, but I hope you have a good doctor", "Maybe video chat them a bit more, talk to them daily to let them feel your presence", "you are so skillful!! you should start your own brand!!", "I am a huge fan of hers too!", "Ahh, I don't have any siblings but I bet it was a great time", "Yeah small hint of peace in the morning before your hectic work day starts and all those meetings.", "That is true. They probably look way different in person", "Oh don't think like that, it will only make things worse. Just be supportive and focus on yourself", "Wow so happy for you. I have always wanted to go myself.", "I'm sorry that happened to you.", "Whoop! it's gonna be a fun time!", "What a horrible thing to witness", "wow, you are so lucky, I love the beach", "I would be as well.

Be his eyes.", "Don't worry, just appreciate him everyday", "i dont blame you. i moved out at 17 and i couldnt ever move back..", "You should celebrate when you hear back!", "thats hilarious and terrible at the same time.", "Maybe you can invite someone every now and then, like a neighbor or someone you trust.", "You also sound like a good person.", "Thats right! they didnt wanna to see the slaughter anymore.", "Oh ok. That is so nice of y'all. That does not happen often enough.", "Yeah I understand that. I hope you feel better!", "Yes, it's a traumatic experience to be in an earthquake", "I like your positive attitude!", "why?? its good time to think", "Don't feel too hard on yourself.

Hopefully it doesn't hurt too bad.", "LOL a bat, how random", "I hope it does and you can KEEP going there! haha", "Now that is what I am talking about!", "It's okay to give in to cravings every now and then.", "you should reduce the intake!!", "thats gross, go see the dentist please!", "You will if you believe you can!", "thats awesome, I love applbees, I like to drink there alot", "I have only 2-3 close friends with whom I closely associate. I think that is the ideal number one should have", "very bleak, maybe we will have some sort of saving grace candidate.", "Exactly! I'd like to pick it up with a scooper and throw it in their faces.", "Perfect, make him think you dont know, or dont know everything.", "I wish you all the luck!", "I'd be livid! Some people just won't let us have nice things, I swear.", "I'm always nervous at job interviews!", "i'm glad he was able to get some relief from that storm anxiety", "i can understand that. it is hard at first but then it gets better.", "I hope you will be at peace soon.", "Well maybe this will teach him a lesson and he'll come out of prison a new man.", "thats true, its always good to get testing and precautionary procedures.", "have you been passed over it before?", "It's always nice to have someone show you things. You're very lucky.", "I hope you get the job!", "I can't wait to have a dog. Maybe when my daughter is older..", "that's the confidence. I am sure you will do it", "I'm glad that you care about others.", "hahaha, thats true, thats not the worst outcome", "that sounds like a crazy day", "That's a good idea!

I think you'll do great though.", "yea i would be too", "I actually took it late evening class without too many students and even was scared and only had to speak in front of the professor.", "That's fair, having a father figure be present is really important.", "The only way I'll get in is if I'm too drunk to care if I get eaten lol", "Yes! It is always good to have a positive attitude.", "Good for him. But do not count on such things happening in life. They are very rare unless you put hard work to get them", "That is usually pretty unlikely but I'm rooting for you.", "Indeed, enjoy your time away!", "Oh I enjoyed board games when I was little too", "i bet it was", "Did anyone see it happen?", "I'm sure I would've been shaking as well!", "Oh wow, I'm sorry to hear that. That must hurt.", "yea i bet it does", "Yeah, as long as it is loud but not too close I usually love it!", "Did you end up getting another ever?", "I hope you have more nights like it!", "Oh man, having weekends off is such a deal breaker for me too.", "Don't be upset about it. Kids do not yet have conscious ability to think concretely in terms of other's feelings", "Yes, I can imagine it must be hard for you as well. I wish you guys all the best.", "i dont blame you", "Good luck! I hope you get it.", "I can't imagine why that person would do that! So unreasonable.", "That's wonderful! I hope you had or have a great time!", "I really like cats but I want a dog at some point.", "i bet it is, good luck with tha", "Oh wow that sounds so scary! I might have done the same actually!", "I once was bitten by a snake, luckily it had no venom.", "Luckily you can always contact your husband to see how he is doing and hear his voice.", "If it's not bad,, I wouldn't tell them", "Yeah, usually you just move on. There are plenty more fish in the sea!", "That's always a great way to make me feel more at ease!", "Frick isn't a curse word.", "Yeah that's the same reason as me.", "that is tough. my mothere also has her little dog. but more than likely she will move in with my family", "Congrats, you should try to sleep some thou.", "great! I wish i could find a profitable business.  i don't like worker for other people.", "Yep there's nothing wrong with either of those things!", "Yes indeed,  I've had to deal without power for 48 hours the last bad storm.  Almost three years ago, I was actually struck by lightning while in my home.", "thats great good for you.", "You are a good friend I think", "Cool, that sounds like a great weekend!", "That is too bad, don't give up hope thou.", "Oh that's a relief though!", "That's good.

It's always good to hear when people decide to take a good step forward.", "Do you have a girlfriend?", "Oh cool! Sounds like fun!", "He may not.  He has certainly made a few enemies.", "That's a great position to take especially when something like this occur.  It puts so many things in perspective on what's important.  I'm glad you have good doctors so you can focus on just being there for her.", "It really could help. I heard Einstein used to wear the same clothes everyday because it would help him stay focused on his studies!", "still worth it imo", "That was nice, you should help them next time.", "Does he grill a lot?", "Oh so it was your work? That's understandable then.", "Wow I'm sorry I hope you can figure something out!", "So when are you expected to hear back for final decision on your hire?", "i get what you meam", "wow. glad to hear you are ok", "Well hopefully you feel better about the situation. It will hurt for awhile.", "Will he be going to college?", "That is great news, good job.", "Cool, sorry to hear that you didn't get it.", "That is great, do you ever help him study?", "That's fair, good for them then!", "It sometimes helps to remember the good times you had together.", "i would always do that", "Glad you have a place like it to enjoy", "The cat must of got tired.", "That was brave of you to talk to her.", "That's a good way to be a parent. They will grow up to be more honest and respectable.", "That's a nice commitment.  My father is an Air Force veteran.  I'm not too fond of the military, but it definitely makes a difference in the lives of many.", "Yes, I wish I could go back in a time machine.", "He doesn't really say anything of substance in my opinion. Just vague words. But hey, to each his own!", "Maybe you should cook for her one night.", "Ohhh that's a hard subject. I struggled with physics a lot, but not as much as chemistry.", "That's a good amount, cool!", "I thought you hit it off thou?", "yea i would die if i saw that", "Good. But my advice to you is do not count on them too much as they have astronomically low chances of winning even anything at all", "Just be careful and don't get too excited and start swiping it all over!", "That's awesome to have that type of dedication.", "Where will you have the party?", "Not when, where I asked?", "What kind of math do you teach?", "Why don't you return it?", "He pretty much has everything at this point.", "Oh wow.  I will definitely need to look at that.  Was there many casualties?", "They can hire teachers to come to the house.", "Sounds delish! I really like Moes southwest grill. If you get the chance you should try it.", "Do you have any other pets?", "The food is not very healthy so you are not missing much", "yes you should. its not hard!", "Have you ever been there before?", "Man, the tax system needs a complete overhaul. Hope things work out for you in the future.", "Will he buy you a cake when you shop next time?", "That sounds fun! I like boats, but I don't think I would be a good rower.", "I never heard about it. I'm glad nobody died though!", "All you can do is keep working hard.", "My daughter just had a nice birthday dinner with family.  My granddaughter had a couple of parties. What kind of party do you plan on having?", "The kids can always visit you.", "Well Its always fun to get the people on their phones thrown out of the movie theater", "Those are good cars.  I have a volkswagen beetle and I love it!", "Yes, pizza with some olive oil and balsamic vinegar dipping.", "I hope they caught the guy.", "I need to look it up, never heard of it.", "My dog is the worst, Always crys, he is pretty young. But I wish he was like your dog.", "Do you know who it is?", "i agree. no one can ever take those from us", "I hope everything goes well for you!", "Too bad, is you window broken now?", "Unfortunately there are people like that in this world, but maybe they can change someday.", "seeing the people you love in real life feels always different, i'm glad you were happy!", "Same here, CS is just as important as the products we buy.", "Well you should take a leap of faith and go in with an open mind.", "It's rare this days for people to hand make gifts or anything.", "Did they get mad at you?", "best to block her in every way so you don't hear about her life", "Well what you should do first is be with your family and those who care about you.", "This is a trail where you can walk for months?", "I just love relaxing here. My favourite thing is no neighbours !", "that sounds so interesting!", "Well, I am working my way up to taking a flight across the oceans perhaps one where I'm in a plane in the sky for over 8 hours.  Outside of that, I will give it to you that you are really brave.", "Haha sadly it does not. I still hold off on doing it in my own apartment at 26. Unless they are very young I don't think here really is a good way unless it smells", "wow!! that sounds horrible! i cant believe she even tried to get your number! did you give it to her? hahah", "I bet you feel really respected and welcome there.", "I guess learning to appreciate positives and get past negatives is part of life :)", "Oh that's great! You must be very proud.", "that sounds fun but dangerous at the same time, is it ?", "That's great that you had someone to help you.", "That's great. I hope you have a wonderful time.", "I cant stand noisy pipes. I hope he is able to fix it for you.", "I would be to if I were in your shoes.  I would be very disappointed too.", "What did you have?", "Hopefully he can take constructive criticism, I think more people should be open to that.", "Saved you the money from having to call pop a lock.", "I felt the same way when my youngest started school. They grow up so fast.", "That is so sad, they don't seem to understand workers.", "Why did you do that?", "That sounds terrible. I hate to hear single mothers dealing with extra problems like these. If anything I would advise your son to be careful and defend himself.", "Now it's your turn! Surprise her with something that will remind her of something special too. People hate to hear it, but our parents are only with us for so long, and when they're gone we have so many regrets. Use that as a motivator", "I'm sorry!  Maybe you could try distancing yourself from this person, you have to protect yourself first.", "Oh..the phone part is the worst! And being transferred and re-telling the story! I am glad they reversed it though! Most companies won't!", "That's terrible, but good for you for having a plan. You'll get through it, your happiness is the most important thing!", "Oh fantastic! I am sure they are happy to be home.", "That is good, maybe you can still hang out with them outside of work.", "I am sorry to hear that but luckily noone got hurt.", "That is awesome.

I don't blame you.", "What caused it?", "You are going to love that thing for a long time, seriously congratulations!", "Well, if i had enough money, i would travel the whole world. But unfortunately, i have to be at work even during summers", "I am very impressed!", "My aunt had this and if you get off all saturated fats, it really cleans your arteries out.", "That's unfortunate, hopefully they develop or allow you access to some medicine that can help you manage that pain. Especially considering how frequent it can be.", "I wish you the very best and much success. I hope it's a million times better than your old job.", "That's awesome. I hope the weather is good for your first ride.", "I am happy you all are OK!  I would have been terrified as well!", "Who was in your family?", "Where did you get the money for it?", "I know how you feel... people also get married and have kids.", "As long as you have an easy way to fill it up.", "That's so nice of you. As I said, most people are very nice. You at least now have peace of mind.", "That is good.", "If your review is good, could you get a bonus?", "What do you do to relax?", "That's great.

I have a feeling you will be very successful.", "Trust is a hard thing to find, I am so glad you found this bond with this person.", "oh", "I am not really a football fan but it is fun to be a part of something!", "Wow!  That sounds amazing and complicated!  Now I understand why you were positively surprised!", "I like also a lot Harry Potter movies.", "yeah there's nothing like the good old days", "Yeah, I have a few friends like that. We hang out now and again, but there are others I'd rather spend my time with.", "Ha that's nice of her! Well if you haven't had your wedding yet, I hope it turns out super nice!", "That's good that you are content with what you have.", "Haha. I can just imagine you running away.", "That's lovely. I love when people just give small gifts to each other for no reason.", "I once lost a wallet with a heavy sume of ash in it and I tried to have faith tht I would find it or some I trusted would find it and return it back to me.", "Did you have your wallet returned to you? If it's your relative I think that everything should work out for good.", "That's so sweet.", "That sounds really good!", "I understand.", "That can be tough. Hopefully she'll understand.", "true! I don't mind the same things. You can do healthy, it just takes more prep and ingredients sometimes to do it tasty and healthy", "That's really difficult to deal with. When you love someone, you lower your guard for that person and more than anyone else they're the ones that can hurt you the most. I hope you find a resolution to your problem.", "Darn it! I have never seen that before, now I am would like to see what it looks like", "That's so wrong. Id speak to a supervisor", "That's great. It's good to see celebreties be the same in real life as they are on the internet or TV.", "Yeah, I will drive almost anywhere rather than fly if I can.", "Well, you could have been going commando, too. And shame on them for not letting you know. Let's focus on the positives--you can pull off skinny jeans, and you're interesting enough to want to wear Superman underwear. Keep it up", "Well, that was a long time ago, I don't think you need to carry it around with you anymore, unless you're still doing it.", "i think you could have removed them and still ate it. isnt that normal for them to have bugs in them sometimes?", "That's great. I think education is more important than ever", "Wow, that doesn't sound good. Situations like this are hard because you probably don't want to offend your family and stuff.", "Yeah, that seems to be what a lot of little ones say for their first word.  Something about it being easier than ma ma - congrats to the little tyke!", "i'm sure she will be able to find a really great job now !", "Maybe you need to go to the store and bring her flowers and chocolate", "Well, my advice is to give in now, because you probably will in the end anyway and avoid any extra arguing you two would do because of it.", "I believe dogs can understand what you tell them, they understand if we say treat or ride after all lol. Maybe you could send a small blanket that smells like you or an old tshirt you have worn to bed. That may help her to feel more comfortable!", "That's great to hear!  Good luck to him!", "Oh a pool! Inground or above ground?", "Did you complain to municipality?", "LOL.  Yeah, been there. Even when those guys do that and are wrong they typically never apologise. They just pretend like they weren't acting like a jerk.", "Have fun!  I'm sure you will.", "Hope it get resolved soon", "I hope you can figure it out soon!", "Well gotta watch out for him...it's the quiet unassuming ones that are usually full of surprises", "I knew a couple of people whom I suspected of fitting the description we talked here. And I tried to stay away from them as much as i could", "I have two wiener dogs, and they are both spoiled brats, but I love them. You should be very happy with your girlfriend's choice of gifts.", "That's sad to hear :(  That happened to me before and I came out ok in the end, I'm sure you will too :)", "Well, I hope you get to talk to him more and maybe can get over there for a visit!", "I know how you feel. If I had an accident like that I wouldnt be able to pay either.", "That's pretty awesome.  How much richer are you now", "That is good that the person was courteous. That may not happen everytime", "That's good to hear. How did the other person fare?", "Are you going to be able to purchase the truck for yourself anytime soon?", "That sounds fun. I love going to the lake its so relaxing.", "Make sure you give each of them a thank you card", "Haha that's pretty funny", "You sound very dedicated, that's great you're so focused on your health, you will age gracefully I'm sure!", "Yeah, really makes you want to touch anything in a store with booger hands wandering around putting his hands on everything.", "Woah! I could live for ten years on that. Hope you wrote down his tag - maybe you could sweet-talk him into going for a drive!", "That is so sad. Have you seen or heard from her again?", "Maybe you can hide some of your things, or put them in a safe place.", "That is so great, I'm glad you got your little friend back.", "I would be very jealous. Dont let it get to you too much. At least it doesnt seem like you see him all that often.", "That is really nice to have found. I hope you hold onto them in a safe place.", "I understand how you feel.  Maybe its time to change locations?", "I would have as well. I am sorry that happened to you and I hope you can learn to sleep peacefully again.", "that's great to hear! I hope you will meet your true love soon! I believe when you do you will now right away. When i met my husband i knew right away he is the one. such a strange feeling. But we've been married for 5 years now and still crazy about each other", "That seems strange in this day and age. I thought everything could be done online. Perhaps you could hand deliver those parts.", "I understand. Have a good trip. Are you traveling alone?", "You just have to keep working at it.", "Yeah you are right. Better to take things slow and figure out what they are all about first.", "Then you'll be fine :)", "I had never heard of that before. That sounds like tragic timing. And you're right, I probably shouldn't have brought up getting another one so soon, it just sounded like you'd be a good owner, since you seem like you care so much. It makes sense for you to not rush right back into it.", "They are the best.  I think it is good to go later, because you know what you want more and don't waste time and money.", "Maybe you will a friend soon. Or even meet a nice guy.", "I'm praying that she will be fully healed, and that you will take good care of her.", "You are welcome, I am glad I can put you in a better mood.", "I'm sure you were pretty nervous after you applied.", "I'm sure you'll be fine. Statistically its safer than driving.", "My dad really enjoyed fishing. I think I'd like the peace and quiet of it.", "It isn't easy to be successfully self-employed but she did it!", "Have you thought about getting back into it?", "Nice, what job did you apply for?", "Watch some youtube videos of other peoples misfortunes so you can forget about yours quickly!", "Probably it is just the theme of his party. He wanted to have some fun in the form of cautious excitement", "That is really nice to have. Most people don't even have one good friend.", "well i really wish you very good luck with all that", "That sounds so good I love coconut rum that would have made my birthday awesome I'm glad you enjoyed it.", "I understand. That sounds frustrating", "Crappy neighbors are crappy. That must have been pretty scary.", "I know how that goes.

I hope that for both your guys' sake you are able to communicate a little more properly in the future. I don't think therapy on its own can work unless everyone is willing to listen to each other.", "Well, you're doing a good job as a parent. There's no justification for what he's done but he had the strength of character to confess to the teacher when confronted. He's still a good kid even if he does bad things occasionally. I hope you guys can put this past you quickly.", "What a nice neighbor you have, awh well happy and congrats to you and the fam.", "Well I hope you know that you're appreciated and that was a very nice thing to do.", "ewww. well, at least he got a shirt. right? lol", "I don't blame you.

Shes adorable now though", "that is good i hope he recovers well from it", "I'm so proud of you! That had to be a lot of fun and a lot of effort", "Oh my, sorry to hear that. These things are never easy. You must be strong in order to fight this.", "Yeah it is crazy to see things we used to have in our lives every day years later.  Makes you wish you could go back to those days when everything was so easy.", "That is great you will teach and see your kids grow and because of you that is awesome.", "that is pretty disgusting", "Did you end up taking her back?", "wow thats a good split, what are you going to do with your 10 percent ?", "Sounds like a solid plan, you should go for it!

But then I'm a little on the vindictive side, lol!", "I used to be that way too.  One thing to think about that might help is even if you do look stupid for a second nobody is going to remember 10 minutes from then.  Another thing that helped me was thinking about how good it felt if a stranger started talking with me in public for a 2-5 minute conversation and how it didnt upset me or make them look stupid so I shouldnt look stupid if I did the same thing.", "Thats good, it must be relieving to feel so confident.", "Oh nice.  where can I find it?  Netflix?", "Did you do something to cause the breakup?", "Doesn't give anyone the right to steal it, tho'. I'm so sorry - how awful for you. I hope they had a horrible time when they tried to spend it!", "hahaha, I dont know if people today would rather lose electricity or get a tornado.  Either way I hope you stay safe and if a tornado does come you dont take any damage!", "Nothing in life is certain, the only control you have is to decide what to do with the time that has been given to you.", "Oh, you don't work with them anymore?

I am so sad that happened to you.", "You're right, sorry for putting words in your mouth. And yeah, I don't know how to engage with them either.

Don't be so hard on yourself.  People should be begging for your attention. Not the other way around ;)", "Oh wow!

Maybe you could give the $20 to charity?", "Oh yeah, I forgot that's one of your responsibilities! Well, you know your brother best, so I'm sure you'll know what to do. But if you think he won't like the typical drunken debauchery stripper party, don't do it just because it's the thing everyone does. When my brother had his wedding, we just sat around and played video games", "It's good that you are making an effort. That's more than a lot of people do.", "Yup i totally get you, it's same here and now it feels time is going super slow, these next 2 weeks are going to be hell before i go to see her, make sure you enjoy yourself!", "ah thats cool then", "Yea thats hard.  You cant do anything now, but maybe theres another neighbor that you can get close too", "If I were you, I'd be the same way, just counting down the days. I hope your travel goes smoothly.

That would be unlucky", "Yup!  It really makes you appreciate life!", "Ugh that must be so aggravating that you can't even get your money back. I would suggest calling and telling the manager.", "As you should, spitting in food is never the right answer. Hopefully you learned something from this.", "Yeah I think I would have felt the same!", "I suppose if any car should be fit for such a task, it would be a Tesla.", "Neither would I. Hopefully, the other person is paying up for the damage at least", "that is amazing. my mom never really cooked for us but she was a great mom. i bet you miss home.", "Wow, that seems bad.

You should teach him more tricks!", "It must be frustrating! How are you gonna go about doing it?", "Did he pass? At least you got to appreciate him and show him your love", "I was of been furious as well. How could they ruin a nice day!!", "I was hoping for an easier way, but I guess like all worthwhile things hard work is key", "hm must've been a really controversial show.", "If only it was Christmas all year long, hu?", "That sounds amazing! We need a Korean restaurant in our town, I would love for one to open here!", "That's so nice! Perhaps you should dwell on good memories like that of her to rid yourself of your sadness. We have to remember the good times with our loved ones!", "I use puppy pads in my house in case my dog needs to use the bathroom in the house.   Those seem to work pretty good!", "makes me think, what am i doing to reach my goals today?!", "Oh gosh. Wonder why she won't be upfront about it.", "Wow!

Your confidence will no doubt help you tomorrow.", "Im sorry man! stay optimistic! dont be sad about it.", "Don't get emotional with him and don't let anger to ruin your relationship with him. Just distance yourself from him. That is it", "That's really rough, my friend. I am sure there must be other folks that you can befriend! There's plenty of nice and kind people in the world.", "I can't imagine how much that much hurt. I hope you can at least cherish the memories you had together.", "That's sounds delicious. I am sure it'll be much better than whatever Pizza Hut can make!", "LOL....that trash would have been on the ground.", "That's cool. I like when stores are organized and not a chaotic mess!", "Well, you may want to think about admitting it to the store manager and paying for it.  Especially if it's bothering you this much, it's the ony way to resolve it.", "I am so sorry for your loss. It seems that I have to re-calibrate my psychic abilities.", "Well maybe you should start with a small slope and work your way up. Don't terrify yourself.", "That is unusual behavior for a clown.  I would say you might want to call the authorities.  There has to be a law against a creepy clown stalker", "When the sun is burning like this I'd like nothing more than to just lay under a soft serve machine and pull the handle.  Good times!", "Nice.

Just be careful the next time!", "Ah, well, I hope you enjoyed it! I am sure that won't happen often.", "Sounds like yall will have a blast!", "I hate mine too! I want to smash that thing with a sledgehammer!", "I agree. You must find a way to preventthis so you dont get embarrassed again.", "That is a long time.  I am sure you have a lot of catching up to do", "You should have chased him and must give your piece of mind", "Oh man.  So the cancellation of Beverly Hillbillies took a toll on your health?", "Whatever they preach on Beverly Hillbillies is the law of nature. If they were afraid of coasters, I would be too. Tread lightly, friend.", "I am sure you will too. When I did, I thought I was on top of a mountain! (but I really wasn't because I was plummeting towards the earth)", "Anyway, you got it now.

All you can do now is try your best moving forward.", "I was worried you were going to say something bad happened. I'm relived.", "That definitely changes things. I could understand how that might be considered weird, I agree.", "Sounds like you've got a lot of faith in your friend.", "I've never read it, but I might check it out!", "I understand! I just got back to that point of being financially stable. I'm happy to help where I can but it is tough", "Everyone i talk to say the same thing which has always kind of put me off.", "IT IS GOOD THAT YOU ACCEPTED MY WORDS.. CHEER UP .. EVERYTHING GOING TO BE ALRIGHT..", "A lot of people say they care about these issues but I'd like to see more people put their money where there mouth is. We do live in a society.", "That is the worst, I always hated school when they would make you stand up in front of the class and do things, even worse when you have to do it with someone you are not friends with!", "Did they get any money?", "That's terrible... At least you tried to save him.", "That's a relief! I'm glad to hear that he is doing great now!", "You should have someone with you. An intimidating person.

Just try to make this the only time, and in my experience, you're going to have to pull out all the stops with this dinner!", "I'm glad they help you forget about all your cares though. You are lucky to have them", "Well that's good news at least! i Hope you are better too.", "Nothing can really replace a loved pet you had for a long time, all you have is memories really.", "Sometimes it's hard when things seem to always go against you. Just remember that God doesn't give us more than we can handle! You'll come out a stronger person in the end. I wish you the best!", "Oh you can be! Everyone can!

Tomorrow is a new day. What do you want to do with yours?", "Well if they were family heirloom or photographs, I don't really think the money would have been important. The family passes down antiques and precious items for keeping.", "That's really frustrating, they'll realize only when you start distancing yourself from them", "Sorry for the delay. I had a technical difficulty. Either way, I'm sure there were no hard feelings. A lot of people sign up to work those camps every year.", "That's the best thing you can do really. I hope she comes back soon for your sake!", "I'll need to find some and give it a taste myself! That sounds awesome.", "Oh odd. That's a good way to look at it though; too many people get too angry with their pets over these type of things.", "I suppose that makes sense. As long as both of you are happy with your relationship dynamic, that's all that counts!", "That is a real shame, at least you can hold on to your memories.", "One can only hope!", "Yeah forest fires are getting really bad.", "Practice definitely makes perfect!", "Soon they will be leaving the nest, hey?", "I hope it is nor Samonella, just a temporarily bug.", "I bet you guys were close and this certainly brought you all closer together.

I don't think I would have the courage now. Will you do it again?", "Sounds important. I hope you're able to meet your goal!", "Awesome. I've only rode dirt bikes personally, but i definitely see the appeal.", "That is such a great attitude!", "Yeah, me either, although there have been some good ones lately. Better stories, more plot.", "Yes I know.  It hasn't been easy for me either, but I believe think will go our way pretty soon.", "Cool! That's so neat.", "Well, stick through it! I wish you luck :)", "Lol, burn those calories. Hope you have a high metabolism.", "Now you have more information to base your next decision on. You live you learn.", "Wow! Maybe you should take uncle out for dinner! LOL", "I can only imagine! When my parents open old photo albums of my siblings and I, they get teary-eyed.", "I'd be very nervous too.  I get stage fright.", "That's great. It's just as good to remember the great times you spent together as it is to grieve.", "Sorry this happened!", "Yikes. I'm glad you're not mixed up in that!", "Oh no! Really? Were they upset?", "Were you more mad at them or your spouse?", "Phew! I'm glad that's all it was.", "Uh oh don't want to be that kid that's for sure!", "Yes, I think that would be a little surreal, and I might feel ambivalent about it.", "So the items are sentimental to you? I know how hard it is to part with items that have memories behind them, but at the end of the day, they are just items! :)", "I really enjoy that too!", "It's a crowd pleaser. I love the dips and apps at get togethers like that.", "You deserve them! That's excellent to hear.", "Better than nothing but still no patty melt!", "That could definitely be tough. Especially with a baby.", "Oh wow thats always nice when everyone can agree on the same movie.", "That's cool, nothing wrong with being faithful.", "Toyota's usually last a long time so it might be a good decision.", "Dang! Well at least you got a good story to tell now!", "Well at least you get to be with the man you love...hopefully", "More people are open and into it so yo ucan always talk to your police about it", "Thanks for the advice. I have trouble letting the petty things go but I think I'll learn to be better as time goes by. I wish you a happy marriage!", "Yeah, that is a shame. I'm so sorry to hear about your loss. I know how important a great teacher can be your life.", "Do make sure to get a good nights sleep before hand. That is just as important.", "I can understand why you felt so nervous. A mothers attachment is rather strong to a newborn. You should get him a gaurd dog when he's a bit older if you still feel that way.", "I never got into COD and I tried Overwatch when it first came out but I wasn't very good. Fortnite on the other hand I'm alright at.", "I can imagine. Things like are always so stressful, but so nice once they are completed.", "Make sure you bring something to drink as well. can get quite thirsty ya know.", "I'm sure they are! Itll feel more normal soon, I am sure", "Yikes! I've had that before. My thoughts are with you. I'm sure the dentist will take care of it though.", "What type of dog is it?", "That will be fun, maybe he will even let you play his xbox on it.", "I agree. The convenience is nice now, but the quality is much lower.", "Im sure your wife also appreciates you getting along with her family.", "That's the spirit. I bet you're a wonderful pianist.", "What's the one you are most excited about?", "Are they almost done with it?", "That is sad.  I am sure you can come up with a good career.  What do you like to do?", "For sure. Well good luck! Nurses are very under-appreciated. I hope you get.", "i can see where isolation can be overwhelming and the need for social contact is desirable and needed", "I bet it's all in your head. I am sure it will all good smooth.", "Proud of the little pup!", "Why are there so many weirdos in this world? I'm glad you made it out safe.", "That's a little dangerous. I'd definitely talk to her about why you didn't allow her to go to that party, and maybe she'll realize that what you're doing is for her own good.", "Yes.  Chocolate is my nemesis.  I think it is more addicting than cocaine", "I can imagine, talk about bad timing injuring your toes!", "Good for you for standing up for your little brother. hope the kid is ok though.", "Are they gone now or is a reunion possible?", "Dang, I wish I could have it happen to me someday!", "I hope you were really proud of yourself :-)", "I hope you and your family enjoy the new home.", "He is a mix breed. We don't really know.", "I hope you accomplish everything!", "Well, I'm sorry you had to see that!", "Im sure it can be highly rewarding too.", "Oh, I would be scared too. apartments seem safe unless the roof gets ripped of of coarse.", "I hope you do it!", "started out slow but now it is!", "Mine too. Can't help it, those eyes!", "What a bummer! Sorry to hear that.", "Maybe, im not sure yet", "It might have upset him but I'm sure he'll understand!  Everyone loses their temper sometimes and it's not like you didn't have a legit reason", "oh yes then you need much more than a starbucks gift card!  good luck!!", "That is great because friendships are very important", "Its shows a lot of care", "Oh boy. I'm not sure where you'd find one. That's pretty old fashioned. Did you find one?", "Sounds like a great way of handling a potentially sticky situation - good job!", "that's good though! I bet you're grateful.", "Yea,thats the right thing to do", "Oh wow... it seems like bad things always hit at once like that. Hang in there - I hope it will get better for you!", "Oh that's so great - and now you can feel comfortable leaving them with her more often!", "Are you ever going to do it again or are you done? I went when I was a child.", "Definetly! it starts with a single person right", "Oh,congrats dear", "Then you must have felt relief.", "oh man I hope you got a second opinion? I would be so worried about your injury. I am so sorry.", "I wouldn't sweat it, chances are you won't see any of those people again right? Even if you do, it's unlikely they'll remember you let alone your smelly fart.", "I'm sure it does, I don't have any of my own but I would be really sentimental.", "I know, but I'm sure you'll do great! I went to school for many years through a Master's degree, and although it was hard, it was worth it.", "Be happy that you were able to spend some time with her and sharing personal time with her by helping her with her homework. Not many parents do that for their children", "That is heartbreaking. That sounds really good. Never purchased one of those.", "Constant work and attention is key to a great relationship!", "Yes and it always bothers me looking through scatches.", "It takes awhile for it to be over. Find a hobby to take your mind off of it. It helps to ease the pain.", "oh man that is horrible!  I am so sorry", "That's good. No sense in rocking the boat.", "Oh I know it's hard. Just try to relax and it will go quick.", "Dang, well I hope you can continue your goal of meditating every day!", "Oh,dont mind me,just been curious", "I feel that, plus it's nice not to have to worry about returning it.", "Well I am sure he will get better with age", "They are really good about that. They have a lot of safety features you don't even realize. We were stuck on Space Mountain once.", "That's depressing to here. I have family members who are still cool now as well, but I just think so fondly on when they were younger. They grow up too fast, and it really is amazing when they're young and innocent and haven't been exposed to the real world yet.", "That is true. There are many situations where experience can strengthen your skills compared to just learning it from a book.", "That's an awesome name. I have two feists. If you're not familiar with the breed, they resemble Jack Russell terriers, but they are bred for squirrel hunting. Their names are Whiskey and Ruby.", "yeah I understand what you mean definitely", "How long did you have your cat?", "It sounds like a fun event.", "That is good that you are a nice friend to her.", "I could never do something like that.  Thank you for your service", "Maybe he has forgotten how it feels to randomly be called into your bosses office. He's moved on up.", "Yeah, that had to be tough. I'm glad she's doing better now though.", "I know the feeling. You work so hard just to feel crushed.", "Nice, well hopefully nothing like that ever happens again!", "Oh, you shouldn't feel bad about it, i'm sure it was fine to eat!", "Yes, I am a product of a broken marriage. My children are too. Keep up the good work you guys!", "You were not invited?! That's awful. How close are you to your friend?", "Hope they took it easy with you?", "Men are crazy sometimes!  LOL!", "I agree. Im sure you get bored or lonely while traveling too.", "sometimes we have to learn how to not be jealous of things", "I bet she loves you just at much as you love her.", "I bet, everyone should take time out yo enjoy life every once in awhile.", "Oh no! Was he mad?", "What is a hot slap? Sounds painful!", "Uncertainty can be so agonizing. Just keep your head up though!", "Wow. I'm so sorry. Maybe you could put concrete around it so it damages their car? lol", "That's awesome, cows are amazing", "Me too, it's like you realize more and more that all you have is the present moment.", "You are lucky, and I am sure he will be tons of work but it will be worth it.", "No, but i hope things work out for you in this new part of your life.", "I can. I'm so sorry. Was it something really bad? Or were you able to move on from it?", "I'm not very fashionable, but I do have some t-shirts that I love to wear because they fit me really well.", "You sound so excited about it and your future there. I would be full of joy as well.", "Well, hopefully he is as good as Sherlock Holmes and saves some lives.", "Good! I don't know why people think they can get away with things like that.", "It can be pretty nerve racking, but it is always great practice. You will only get better.", "That's so true. My daughter moved out this year and I'm wondering where the heck the time went!", "Wow congratulations! You must be so excited!", "Yeah, that must be difficult", "I used to, but yeah especially if you're not in school", "Minus one for cats", "What is she going to do there, sounds kind of dangerous.", "Nice, I like your attitude", "Sounds fun! Keep fighting the good fight lol", "I bet that would be cool. I've watched on Tv. They know what their doing.", "Oh I totally know how that goes. I moved to small town and didn't have many friends at first. Once I had my son and made more friends it got way better lol!", "Yeah, I think it gets more difficult as you get older anyway.", "Wow that's sad. I'm sorry.", "Oh, that is definitely a change! But at least you can still keep in touch nowadays.", "That's funny, just don't let it in your room while your sleeping!", "It's a pretty small percentage, but it would definitely be something to worry about.", "Hopefully she has a supportive partner to help her as well. Glad you are there to help her.", "Wow, I never knew cats could even get an aneurysm, but I guess like humans why wouldn't they be able to?", "It definitely can be a challenge. I have a 10 year old boy, an 8 year old girl, and a 2 year old girl. I love being home with them.", "Oh girl, that happens to me all the time too. So frustrating, just leave us alone.", "Dang, I hope everything turns out okay for you guys", "Yeah, at least now you're more aware, it can be pretty tough when you're trying to break the habit though", "Keep it up brochacho", "Confess to them what happened. Let them know how you have changed.", "So thoughtful of you! What did the kids think of visiting the veterans?", "Yeah spending money on things is always a temporary high.", "Well I'm happy for you. Its hard to catch a nap around here sometimes.", "Maybe you couldn't but it sounds like something is going on with her.", "THat is good to hear. What happened to your own car?", "Yes its amazing how much of  a difference a few years can make in age.  It seems that males take quite awile long to mature than females.", "Feels bad, hope you have someone to talk about it with!", "THats awesome, does it pay better than the one he has?  A pay increase is certainly helpful.", "oh don't be, you should be happy for her, there will come a time where you will get something back in return :)", "Me too, maybe our wish will come true only time will tell.", "Oh wow! That's like the worst nightmare! I'm so sorry that happened to you!!", "I'm sure that was not a fun ride home.", "I remember the same thing. And the joy that followed for the next moth was pure bliss", "Alright, so do you ever have to evacuate?", "oh, that's kind of weird", "that sucks, but hey man it's okay one day you'll find right person", "I hope you two have a nice future. At least you know the family will support you!", "Wow! You lazy bum. You disappointed me too!", "Was she understanding and forgiving?", "I hope that you see amazing results, and you continue to enjoy yourself!", "I hope you realize your worth too. I do this thing where I think about another woman in my life who I really care about (mom, daughter, etc.) and I think if this was happening to them, what kind of advice would I give them?  Sometimes, we think we deserve less.", "oh, what happend", "im sorry, what did happend next? how does that make you feel?", "That's horrible! Did you have any sort of tracker on it?", "Wow that sounds like a really big journey. It must have been really hard to connect with one another only through online chats.", "I see, memories will always stay, sometimes good old days just can't come back.", "I have a friend who recently became certified as an instructor. He jumps almost every weekend. He will be taking me when I go!", "Did you ever get caught?!", "Oh im so sorry! I bet your are devestated! I would be tool.", "Alrighty then, just seemed like a really weird thing to say.", "Canada! You should check the laws in your area to see whether or not you are legally allowed to have a pet even if the land lords do not approve.", "You must have a very good connection, that's beautiful.", "Oh well, accidents happen!", "It's a good lesson to learn! Don't worry about it too much. I am sure that the truth will surface eventually.", "what kind of interests?", "All the work paid off!", "you didn't let anything affect the friendship! that's good i am proud of you", "That is quite unique. I'm happy to hear that!", "you sure will, besides hot jocks doesn't sound too bad too me :3", "You must really trust her to let her hold on to your life's savings!", "Yes, it will be worth saving up for. I hope it works out for you.", "I'm sure nothing happened! Gotta have some trust.", "You prepared well! You will do goo.", "I can agree with that", "Yes, sometimes that is the only thing you can do. I hope you are also getting some support from family and other friends", "Very nice! Keep the confidence and dont doubt yourself tomorrow.", "Oh, no want to talk about it?", "Well that's no good, you could try taping it back together", "Oh, eats lots of cake and make sure to have a nice dinner with candles. Maybe a bubble bath too.", "I'm doing well. It's quite early in the morning though, that's for sure.", "Good or bad I have been in that situation many times.  More recently when I was separated from my current wife.  My own place.  Finally!", "oh i know this feeling, but don't worry it's okay! these things happen, soon feeling will disappear", "Very good! I anticipate you will get in!", "Does your sister usually have problems?", "That sounds like the worst feeling.", "it's okay, next just tell them that you didn't quiet understand what they meant and so they will explain it again", "Well that is a good reason to keep holding on to something!", "I hope it goes better than you expect! Cram all that information into your brain!", "True, they aren't a very visually appealing species. But at least they're more afraid of you, that's some consolation.", "I totally understand that feeling and know what you mean! But I wouldn't sweat over it, it happens to the best of us and we learn fro our mistakes!", "Absolutely, Especially when spending a lot of money", "It's wonderful you had someone like your mother to help!", "Hopefully she will understand!", "Puppies are so wonderful, I'm happy for you!", "ohh okay I see, yeah that is a difficult situation. I hope it works out for you and best of luck buddy! :)", "I'm glad that she is getting better!", "At least you kept your sense of humor!", "Not everyone is cut out for sitting in a classroom listening to droning teach-speak.", "You know what they say, the grass is always greener on the other side. Did you ever manage to get him to let you borrow his snowboard?", "I agree with you. Those painted smiles and big, red noses can be so off-putting!", "Wow that sounds really awesome, I would love to listen to you songs. Can I also be the first to receive your autographs? :)", "Now that's an achievement you and her will remember till the rest of her life!", "It certainly has. You deserve it.", "Congrats! That's awesome to hear.", "good plan.  Wait until the shopkeeper was busy with someone else.", "I bet you are! I think you will enjoy your new home and city!", "Congratulations! You're going to do wonderful, I just know it!", "Probably but that is still the worst thing ever.  Are you finally able to laugh about it?", "Well I'm glad that you found someone worthy!", "The unknown is always so scary, but especially in your case! I'm so happy that she's going to be ok. Hopefully that puts you more at ease now.", "That's a big dog.  Blu is a cool name!", "Hopefully the more you warm up to the new job, it will become easier.", "Wow that sounds like an interesting process! I've never done it myself, but it sounds like something I would love to learn.", "Well thats not too bad then.  Good on you for putting your education and studies first.  Im sure it wasnt easy at the time.", "Oh lol.", "That's great. I am sure you will turn a profit in no time", "That's ridiculous! They were clearly not your friends. There are much better people in the world.", "I think you will be fine. If you need some alcohol to take the edge off, go for it.", "what did the note say?", "I consider you to be a lucky guy. I hope one day I can pay mine off completely.", "Oh . What do you do for that?", "That is great! I'm sure everything will work out.", "Oh no? I hope you're okay. Why is it that you feel guilty?", "You must have been really drunk!", "Yeah I hope so too. That must be painful to bare.", "Thats something I would never forget. Hopefully you get another shot at it.", "That's not surprising! Are you thinking about going back to work soon?", "That would make me so nervous! I am horrible in front of people. How did it go?", "What did he train you in?", "That is great,  so happy for you", "You shouldn't be embarrased around your best friends. I'm sure he's just picking in good fun", "Well I'm glad you sobered up and didn't do anything you would regret later!", "It will work out if you believe", "Did they ever come?", "Dating is one of those things that everyone makes seem so easy, but in reality it's just so difficult to be able to open up to people sometimes. I hope things go well for you and you meet someone who makes you very happy!", "Oh I completely agree with you. Some women just need a challanege you know. But its like HANDS OFF!", "I know exactly how that feels.", "I'm confused. What do you being his girlfriend have to do with you not taking his property?", "Where do you live?  Cause it isn't in the US.", "i guess we all learn from our mistakes never take her there again", "It's hard to be accused of something you didn't do. I'm glad the truth prevailed.", "OK,  now I get it. But you need to rehearse in front of a mirror,  that will help", "That's good to hear!", "That is true love, I am so glad you met her!", "be nice to people and you'll see that that's the only thing people care about!", "Sounds like a bribe is in order. Then it's a win for everyone.", "Haha! That's amazing! What a great shot. I usually have to make my husband get rid of them for me.", "that went really dark quickly. making a mistake is not the same thing as dying.", "Now that is hopeful.", "you sure had a fun childhood!", "It is probably one of the best feelings!", "do you believe he comes you with life long?", "being honest is always a good thing, I am glad you are so proud of him!", "aw that's great. you're lucky to have a father who cared like that. mine never did", "What color was he- and its not your fault you were just doing what you thought was best for him.", "hmmm do you think he'll like that after all this time?", "Thats great! How old are you?", "Embarrassment is almost worse than an actual injury! I hope your knee feels better soon.", "maybe you'll be luckier next time!", "Hahah! I bet your cat get spoiled plenty!", "Are you serious? Thats not even close to being the same color.", "Oh no! that must have been embarrasing", "You do have a good point. You really should do what will make you happy because life is just too short", "Good for you!", "I feel that way sometimes too", "I think I will . Thank you for your advice.", "maybe in the future you'll get to go there!", "I'm sorry you are going through that. Sometimes telling the truth is the best, even if other people might get in trouble.", "I love listening to nature. I live in the country, and could not imagine being in the city. I lived there for a few months, but there was too much traffic and noises that kept me up. I moved back to the country.", "That's a great career.", "wow , that sounds so cool!", "That's a great, positive attitude.", "glad to hear it. i hope it's only grown since then", "Personally, I find that a job you enjoy that gets you by is superior to one that makes you a lot of money at the cost of your happiness", "Funny how some of those smells bring back the feelings of old times!", "That's ok , Its a gods grace", "You sound confident. Did the interview go that well?", "Congrats dear,am so happy fpr you", "Did he notice? That would have been embarrassing.", "Hey, family is still family. Unfortunately we don't get to pick and choose. I know it can be hard", "that's great then , glad it didn't affect anything", "no , but if you really liked her , you should be happy that she found someone she like.", "maybe you just don't realize they were bad because you're optimistic to a fault", "Cool! There's a lot of money to be made creating games! I bet you will do well.", "OK,  maybe she's materialistic", "That's wonderful. I hope that her sickness hasn't been too taxing on you.", "That's understandable. What a frustrating experience for you.", "That's how it works with siblings!", "They come out in the daytime too. It's just that they are scarier at night.", "Thats nice of them", "Well, that's good that it was just the cookies? It could have been much worse.", "It's okay. It happens to all of us!", "Just keep looking. My sister started out with a temp job that has since turned into a well paying permanent job that is even paying for her education.", "Absolutely! I used to love computer games too as a kid, but I always knew I had to disconnect with them. And it's so easy for children to access anything, at any time now. Some of the content young people can access is really worrying. It's good that you took your kids to the park, I hope they enjoyed it!", "see? and word of advice never drink without your boyfriend around, trust me it will save you and make him happy, and in return he will make you happy", "i hope she gets you something you like!", "That is their problem , please do not let it affect you", "well i don't know how wonderful you are, but you sure are narcissistic, which isn't a good trade to have, people are all equal there is no difference in us", "Do you think you'll keep the job after school?", "It will be fine", "That's great that she makes you proud.", "Your message got cut off - but I hope it has been a good switch for you!", "can you not see it? how everyone is just chasing after their desires, living in this delusional reality thinking they are free but in reality they are just sheep living in a cettle, they don't even see that because of their desires, as long sa they can chase after women, money and drugs they are fine, but they can't see how they are nothing more than just sheep... if only there was a way to wake them up to show them what being a human is", "that's some good news!", "Try meditation. It worked well for me!", "Yeah that's true, you can't always be in control of everything.", "I would just have a heart to heart with him. I guess I would be honest. You want to please him but you have to take care of yourself, too.", "Good. You were probably not the only one who felt that way about the jewelry", "I enjoy visiting with my family too.  Unfortunately, I don't get to see them that often.  But when we do, I have a lot of fun.  Did you do anything special?", "Oh that's okay. Everyone overindulges once in a while", "Yeah, they can multiply pretty quickly.", "Yeah.  So what did you do then", "Sounds like you have a fulfilling job. That's very lucky.", "don't worry there's always another chance", "I bet. That's so gross. I would have been sick!", "Wow that's awesome!  That's a very long lasting relationship, I'm happy for you.", "What did he do? what a mean person", "the world still have some people in it .", "Even though it's hard, it's probably best to come clean to relieve some of the guilt.", "that sounds so good. glad you enjoyed your day!", "Seriously?who is expecting so much from you", "I bet he felt very proud! Sounds like you are a great parent. A good combination of trust and reassurance.", "Good for you!", "Lots of people do that nowadays. I think you would be happy you went.", "Oh, didn't work out, huh?", "Try to take care of yourself", "That's so romantic and inspiring! I hope you have happy lives together!", "I hope you hear positive news from them soon!", "if you truly regret it you will tell her now, go and do that1", "i can imagine, it happend to me before and it was actually someone trying to break in, i called hte police and they ran off", "I am glad you made it there with only a few hiccups along the way. You must have a good memory when it comes to directions.", "That is good to hear. Yeah, my parents married young and it worked out for them too. I am happy to hear that it turned out good for you.", "i know right? they make you happy and in the end that's all one needs", "I agree, I wouldn't be in the mood to eat after that either, it's disgusting.", "maybe it happend for a reason? maybe you will find a better apportunity to get there", "How many pages do you have to go? You should try to finish it today and power through it!", "that's so insane right? glad you did it yourself!", "Yeah each cat has their own personality. It's good to reflect on little things like that. Maybe once the sting of all of it is over you can get another one and continue to create more sweet memories like the one you just shared with me.", "Wow, she sounds like a real piece of work. I'm glad you reported her. Maybe they should consider firing her.", "Well, then, you should think about God when you see them", "We went through the same thing with my husband. I know it is stressful, but I am so glad you got through it and things are better now.", "Wow, it's always nice when we get something we really want. Especially if we have to compete for it.", "Wow,you made it,congrats", "Sure  your worth your time. do not be so down on yourself.", "Just take heart OK,  it's one of those things", "You can't change the past. All you can do is learn from it. If you are sincere then your family will forgive you.", "That's part of being a good parent, it all goes hand in hand.", "That's a mercy, at least. Are you hurt?", "I see where you're coming from. Sometimes though you got to make a stand and show you're serious about the position.", "Makes it even better that you didn't know you were getting it.", "Ohhh kids.  Please just take it easy on them ok", "Was this at the office? Or perhaps at school?", "Whats the name of the dog?", "LOL....White cloths can be scary too.", "Exactly , it is quite cool", "That's awesome. Glad you had fun! That's what's important", "Was he one of your best friends? Sounds like you have some more catching up yo do!", "Oh, that's rough. That can be a lot of clean up.", "That sounds scary. How often do children of the employees at your work end up harmed because of the chemicals?", "Let's hope he keeps it up!", "It's well.  Please accept my condolence", "Cool. There's nothing like receiving family heirlooms.", "Am so happy for you,you have gotten a pet", "I really hope it all works out for you. Work is important but your health is way more important!", "That's the spirit! It's a positive thing so long as you remain faithful. Did you tell your significant other?", "Have you considered couples therapy to try and work things out?", "That person is heartless though", "Seems like it is your fate then. I am also starting a new venture and it is taking a lot of time and hard work but I think it is finally paying off soon.", "You should go see a doctor about that. Sleep deprivation is very unhealthy", "You're taking steps in the right direction I get a feeling you're doing alright for yourself out there.", "I'm glad things have worked out in the end for you. Sometimes bad things happen for a reason.", "I'm glad you have a cuddly fur-baby!", "That's awesome!

It's really an artform", "Sounds like the start to a bad day.", "U are on point.  It helps  a lot", "You are so lucky. I recently got married, but we have been together for 12 years and are always there for one another.", "I would have to agree with you on that. 10 years is an amazing amount of time to be together, I hope for another 10 years!", "Does he live near you?", "That is sad, but it is wonderful that you are able to", "I hope she cherishes it as much as you do! You're so awesome for doing that!", "That's great news! Did you have insurance?", "Well, it is very important for you to take care of yourself and if your boss doesn't understand that, I would be searching for other employment. Hopefully, they are completely fine with your needs.", "That may be kinda awkward.", "It sounds like it. You deserve someone like that.", "Yes, the support and love from others that we received was incredible so I always try to help as much as I can.  Even the smallest gestures were meaningful.", "As a military family, we move a lot and finding a good church has been one of my first missions when we get to a new place. It is sad having to leave good churches, but I am blessed to have support from across the country now.", "I'm so happy to hear that for you! I know how animals are the same as family members.", "You are both lucky then! She will remember your kindness for a long time.", "That is hilarious...but awesome at the same time!", "Having a strong support system is so important in life.  Don't know what I would do without my friends.", "I see, that is very understandable, I am really glad that you will be able to see them soon! I hope you have a safe trip and a great time! :)", "I think I will too!", "That's lucky.  You could have ended up on the Internet otherwise!", "That's good to hear, anesthesia seems very helpful.", "I bet, it can be really disappointing when people bail on plans", "That's awesome! I am glad it didn't take long, because those have been a pain in the past for me.", "That's a smart move, that would reduce the risk of injury.", "Well good luck to you!", "What type of job is it?", "That's terrible, hope you weren't counting on it for fincancial reasons", "That sounds exciting, it is always nice to have new kitchen appliances! I hope all goes well", "That sounds like fun! And a great cure for loneliness!", "Aw, did it turn out okay?", "I hope you still found a great home! The home buying process is certainly frustrating.", "It definitely helps to have a lot of support around you. Take care of yourself through this very difficult time.", "No and I went to the grocery store and the library like that! No one said a word. It was so embarrassing.", "2 year olds don't know any better. And when everyone laughs, it can make them want to do it again.", "Well, let's pretend that no one noticed! Either that, if someone noticed, perhaps they smiled when they thought Wow, I've had that happen before, too", "I believe that you will be in a better situation soon.", "Haha but you survied, Go you!", "I know what you mean. I sure miss my departed loved ones.", "I would be also. You should try to get him to fix your tire.", "I miss my grandmother every day. I hope things get easier for you over time.", "Oh wow that is a long time. Why did you change your job?", "Ooops! I'm sorry to hear that. I'll tell you what though, it happens to the best of us! It's just a drink.", "I'm sure she's done something like that in the past herself though.", "Way to live vicariously!", "That's terrible, I hope they are ok now.", "Then you should get it back", "Well it seems like everything has taken care of itself. I'm glad for you that she is doing better! Pretty scary!", "Wow! That happened to me at work when I was pregnant, too. Except for me, it was curry.", "I'm glad it turned out so well!", "I hope they had insurance. It's one of the most horrifying things to experience that. I hope you are there for them.", "I know, at least with my son I get to experience some of that still.", "Were you at least able to get the clog out?  Hopefully your husband wasn't upset.", "What grade to you teach?", "Oh, were they trying to get intel on your company?", "I'm so sorry to hear that.  You'll still have the memories at least.", "That's awesome that you get that continuity. More teachers would succeed if that was available to them. Good for you!", "Some people are unbelievable! Good for you putting her in her place.", "That's good, hopefully they treat each other well.", "That sounds like a great time. I'm sure it's going to be cool to see the puppy grow up along with your son and how their relationship builds.", "Aw I'm sorry to hear that. Losing a pet is never an easy thing, especially when you don't know what happened to him.", "That's excellent. I bet you're going to have a great year, you seem well prepared!", "She must have really appreciated that.", "Yeah I'd be in your shoes thinking the same thing as well. That's almost heart stopping news to hear.", "I'm sure you deserve a break just to kick back and relax :)", "Well, actually, I think that makes sense considering you were a kid and you were use to them being with you upstairs.", "That's great! I hope it was an all around good day for you.", "It feels really good to be recognized for your efforts!", "I will have to check it out! Thanks for the suggestion.", "That's awesome.  I'm so happy for you.", "Awesome, I've gone through old albums like that before as well, and it always makes me feel good.", "I would not beat yourself up over the mistake. We all make mistakes even when we are older and should know better.", "haha, I felt the same when I read some of my old baby sitter's club books", "I hope it's nothing too serious. My younger brother had the same problem early on, but he turned out to just be a slow developer.", "I know right? Grandparents are the best lol", "That's understandable, life goes so fast that it's easy to lose touch with people you care about. All I can do is try to limit that occurrence.", "That msut be exciting then, I hope the tickets aren't too expensive.", "Thats awesome, good friends are always there for each other.", "We don't have to be the best to enjoy what we do right?", "I feel you on that. I don't know if I could let my son play baseball after what I went through. I hope your daughter has a better experience.", "I can imagine!  It's hard being apart, but it makes it that much more exciting to see each other again.", "Yeah it really teaches you! I would always sit down where i was and start crying.", "I hope you were able to laugh about falling and looking silly and not be too embarrassed?", "Thats the perfect time to just pamper yourself. I cherish those few hours every day!", "That's great, the first time for everything is scary.", "Did you enjoy the experience?", "Yep, I do the same thing as well. Sometimes its just best if you let others help you do something.", "Hah, i played the first one a ton on ps3, Wish they would release it for pc.", "The level headed approach will probably accomplish more anyway. I'm sure they have money so I also hope they don't take yours.", "Haha I understand. It's like those cartoons where the smell is dragging someone through the air.", "Yeah, and don't repair it! I think it gives it a history and makes it even more valuable.", "Man thats terrible, I hope you can forget about him and find someone better.", "I'm sure your parents are proud of your ability to take care of yourself.", "Being on a team with someone more skilled than you has it advantages, it's good that he lived up to those expectations.", "That's good, it sounds like his bathroom motivated you to take yours to the next level. That's probably good for society.", "Oh, yes, I know. Some breeds get bad raps and people are so quick to judge! I used to have a pit bull who was a sweetheart!", "I can imagine. Hawaii seems like a beautiful place!", "Yeah, I'm content being at my home town aswell.", "Well hopefully that is keeping you a little cool!", "That's not surprising, but now your friend knows that you are the undisputed champion.", "O,h grandparents are the best at spoiling grandchildren! I could understand that being important to her.", "Excellent. Well there is some silver lining in all of this haha.", "That's awesome! I guess practice does make perfect.", "That is amazing and so nice of you!", "Wow! That is incredible! I hope you have somewhere to put them all.", "Aw that is so sweet. That sounds like the most special day.", "That's awesome. I hope it was an amazing ceremony. Weddings are always so much fun and romantic.", "I wish you luck and hope everything ends up going well.", "We all have those moments. I'm glad yours worked out so well.", "An endless flow of booze is the key to a successful party, sounds like it was a good time.,", "Everything happens for a reason. I think you will realize that and this could be a good thing is disguise.", "That's good, people on Craiglist can be pretty shifty sometimes.", "I would be the same way.  I don't trust anyone to hold on to my comics other than myself.", "Awww, that is too bad. Hopefully you get to video chat with him", "I can't believe it! How could they? I'm so sorry to hear that...", "That's the real trick to it, you have to try to move passed all the bad stuff and remember all the good times.", "Yeah send them my regards. It's a fantastic day when you wake up cancer-free.", "I'm glad you were able to remedy the situation so easily! I think that shows you have a really good relationship with him.", "Did you guys play all the carnival games?", "I really hope that is the last time it happens.", "Once you see that little face, you'll forget everything else no matter which!", "That's great to hear. What a great story. Very inspiring. I'm so happy they are both healthy now.", "ahhh ok you do not participate in that competition", "I also enjoy the love of my human parents and my human family. They take no hesitation in their focus on of their love for me.", "Wow, so jealous! You have to give me a ride one day, ok?", "That's rough, sometimes you really do have to rely on the kindness of strangers.", "I see that is very understandle.", "No problem at all. Glad to make you feel somewhat happier :)", "I'm glad you have someone to rely on for support.", "I'd say so. That's so disheartening. I'm sure it was accidental.", "Yeah, that makes me sad too. I feel bad for them because they don't understand why she isn't with them anymore.", "Well usually when you think the worst it turns out to be okay. I think you should try and relax.", "Thank you for all that you do! I have a friend whos an EMT and I bet it's taxing work.", "Absolutely! Feel better soon!", "I hope you continue to adjust to your new surroundings, maybe you will end up loving Dallas, who knows!", "I bet! Sounds like it would be a big shock", "Yes, I shudder to think of the condition of the rest of the home if the car seat is like that.", "Good luck!", "Oh she will be none the wiser. But don't feel bad sometimes you have to indulge, and I would figure you still left her some.", "that is really good to hear, I bet they loved seeing you again", "I was sure to check my statement and make sure there were no suspicious transactions.", "Ah! Sounds like you need a Cat Whisperer!", "Those are awesome dogs, I've known quite a few in my life. Well whenever you're ready I think it'll be a perfect match.", "Yeah, the comfort in that can feel amazing", "Fingers crossed!", "Okay, then you're waaayyy ahead of me!", "That sounds tough.  It seems like you guys at the daycare went through a lot together.", "Yes, and that's what we did with her. her sisters were a 8 and 9 when she was born.", "Its important to care for the older generation who once cared for us.", "I see! Have you gotten any other works published?", "It must have been awfully windy.", "I'm in the Midwest, so can sympathize with you there.  Are you going to live there permanently now?", "Well it was probably nothing to worry about because you seem alright now. :)", "I know the feeling. I get sick around crowds.", "You are a good friend! That was very generous of you", "So reckless!  It's really not that hard to leash dogs.  And with the baby there too, ugh.  I can't imagine.", "That's good! My son is always running into stuff! He needs bubblewrap to keep him safe.", "That can help. I know I like my hobbies lol.", "Fry some for me too!", "You are kind and sweet. Please never change.", "I understand, but I bet you did well in spite of that !", "Well at least that sounds like an easy fix! Often times those repairs can get pricy!", "I wish you both all the best and hope that you have a wonderful life together!", "Oh no, why were you so scared?", "Could be worse than aliens someone could hurt you. you know ?", "An alien? Wow.", "That always sucks. But old people are great and sometimes funny to hang out with. Maybe you should try giving them a go!", "That's a great friend. Loyalty and honesty are everything in a relationship.", "I hope everything works out, family is everything.", "I think you should. There are so many animals that need a good home.", "Most of the time they do do well. We definitely have to trust our husbands to look after the little ones without us.", "He's probably very grateful for your kindness. Hopefully, he'll return the kindness to someone else.", "I don't either. It's crazy how things like that happen in the most perfect of times, too. You didn't know he was down on his luck, but out of the goodness of your heart, you gave him money regardless.", "You should be in a good place for advancement then, since a company has to hire so many women right ?", "Wow, hopefully you both have insurance.", "What a good story. It's great to hear about success stories like that!", "I like the ravens and I also don't have high expectations! Haha", "Yeah, I guess. take care my friend.", "That sounds delicious! Now my stomach is growling!", "I'm glad you weren't injured, but it really sucks that your car is totaled. I hope you have a reliable mode of transportation!", "Sorry to hear that. I hope it gets there soon to put a smile back on your face.", "At least you had something to cover yourself with!", "well you cant help it and it happens sometimes", "Thats even better haha!", "That's great. You must work for a good company.", "Its a hard age for girls as I'm sure you remember. At least she has a good mom to guide her!", "You can manifest anything your heart desires.", "Yes, I think so too.", "The world would be a better place if more people were helpful like you. Everyine would make new friends everyday. How wonderful would that be?", "Thats probably best not to confront them. People are so quick to kill you these days", "wow that is crazy!", "What a cool experience. I wish my parents kept some of my stuff for me.", "That was probably a good idea. Did he give it to you?", "It was hard. Trying to figure out your identity and hormones and pressure. Those were good years though. I just wish i would have enjoyed them more", "Perhaps next week your team will WIN ! Lets both think positive thoughts for now :)", "aww that is really cool", "Studying has a good effect on grades. I wish you the best. Don't fret !", "Well maybe give it a little TLC and there you go", "keep your head up im sure another lucky break will come along!", "I'm glad you found a way to work it out!", "That's nice of you.", "that was nice of the coworker to not tell anyone the secret.", "That sounds so appetizing.  Do you like mainly chicken dishes ?", "Katrina was a disaster for so many.  I can imagine it haunts you.", "It seems like you were well prepared!  I hope you passed!", "That sounds scary for a child. I bet you got back on though!", "Im not one of them, thank heavens.  Im sure you have a plan B for paying your auto insurance I  hope ?", "The kitten might have been dehydrated.  Hopefully the neighbor called someone else to come help?", "Don't sweat too hard. Try to focus on positive aspects of life right now, because whatever happens that positivity will carry you.", "that is good i glad you were able to move", "Yeah, mine just started 5th and he's in a different building and changing classes and it's a huge difference from 4th grade.", "don't blame you, but as a parent you must see a lot of gross things coming from kids", "omg, did you have a talk with them about how they need to clean up after their dog?", "That is good most people have a hard time in the first week", "Makes sense. Well I'm glad you finally got some sleep haha.", "Maybe report what is going on to the local PD?", "You're so lucky!  I would do the same, except they don't make them in my size.", "Awww. That was so nice of you guys!", "Thats frustrating. At least you'll get your money back eventually.", "That's not very nice of him. Is he older or younger?", "they will never know, as long they have candy and you can keep your dark secret to yourself", "I may do the same as you because yes, this has been an extremely long monday", "I am sorry that happened to you , sometime bad things happen to good people", "Uh yeah!  I hope you got everything fixed.", "How long have you and he been together?", "Very true!  I'm glad it worked for you", "I bet it was! I am glad you survived. lol", "I hope so, too!", "never give up hope, one of these days you'll be waking up in the middle of Manhattan", "I'd try to get a refund!", "fun and dangerous my type of fun. glad you had fun", "Ugh! That really irritates me. I am so sorry that happened. Too bad they couldn't catch those creeps.", "Well I hope you get to be around horses someday!  I don't know much about them but they're so cool.", "so you had a sentimental attachment to it, i understand but as long as you weren't harm", "It is I have had that happen with 2 of my cards and my debit card. I managed to track down through the charges who used the cards", "Awww, what a sweet woman you are. There aren't too many like you out there anymore.", "Well that's good and hopefully the next one doesn't do it too", "you deserve the rest after this week, must be a great feeling to accomplish what you did", "that is a scary situation, so glad everything turned out ok", "Oh no! That sounds scary.", "i do not know either it is sad when a dog is abandon by their owners", "No kidding. I would hate to have to come face to face with one.", "I just can not imagine the heart ache! Poor baby", "I don't think I would help again unless someone found me a face shield.", "Aw, I'm sorry you didn't win. Maybe next time.", "Oh! Bummer. Yeah stress gets to me too! Did you end up passing it?", "Labs are known for their loyalty and obedience. I bet he is a great companion", "Well it sounds like you've done alright so far I'm sure the worst is behind you.", "I love my kitchenaid. It has to be my most used appliance. I can see why you were so happy.", "Awesome! There needs to be more people like you in this world.", "There is surely a reason why. Did she have many family members as bridesmaids?", "Mine is a German Shepherd.  It is amazing how they walk so close to us, almost tripping over us in our path !", "Well hang onto those tight and maybe you can teach someone to play chess in the future.", "I'm sure it was, but it always a great idea to be looking to improve yourself or your position. Do what is best for you.", "but it must be great food if you keep going back", "You and me both.", "I'm sure you're not the only one.", "Oh that is awesome, what did you find?", "Wow, you definitely should be excited and looking forward to it!", "it's satisfying when your pet does a trick, it feels like you and your pet accomplished something meaningful", "That sounds wonderful! I'm sure that felt great.", "That is good, but if it ever becomes too stressful for you I hope that you are able to talk to your friend about it because there are plenty of alternative ways to get her mother to the hospital.", "Well obviously you're the more deserving one.", "i like to garden so i know what you mean", "Wow, you trusted he would give it back and then he didn't. I can understand how angry you'd be!", "Oh haha sorry I misread that! And that is great I am so excited to meet the bunny!! Do we have a name for it yet?", "You should probably stay out of that neighborhood in the future. Glad you're okay. Stay safe out there.", "Oh man, that sounds super scary. I'm so glad your dog is okay I would be lost if amything happened to mine.", "Oh gross that is disgusting. I hope your little buddy is okay though. I don't envy you at all.", "Im jealous :P I need a vacation. The beach is so relaxing too", "That's great that you could do it. Maybe next time will go better.", "Oh, man.  That's a terrible feeling. What did you do?", "that must have been a sight to see", "I bit it is a good and funny memory.", "Oh no, I hope you were alright! But yes that is a funny story to tell your friends :)", "Eh next year they'll have forgotten it mostly", "Hmmm, I guess you could look for the hole during the day and try patching it when the bats fly out for the evening? Im not a bat expert lol.", "That's great, I'm glad you had fun. What was your favorite activity?", "I can so relate to your experience!  WHen I was a child my parents would try to coax me to ride and I hated it. I rode the ferris wheel once and started crying!", "Oh no, even worse. Hope you got the job :)", "I'm glad you got the help you needed and ended up in an actually helpful rehab. It's always good when you have control of the things in your life. Just remember to stay strong when things get tough again and to lean on your support structure.", "I'm so sorry to hear that. She is lucky to have you checking on her, you sound like a good friend.", "Wow! That's unbelievable. Congratulations! How much did you win?", "Wow that is great! I am so proud of you. And hey, it never hurts to study more. :)", "I hope you didn't get burned too badly! I fall a lot. It never stops being embarrassing.", "That's good, easy to quickly notice that awful taste.", "Oh wow! Where did all of this take place? Sounds like a rough part of town?!", "I don't blame them.  The characters were annoying, and the color palate was horrible.", "Oh my fiance loves comics, he buys and sells them. Why is that the only thing to look forward to?", "Oh that's hard but I'm sure you will get yours too. It's hard being patient though when others get theirs before you.", "What a lovely memory! That's hilarious that your dad made you go back and return it!", "Well I hope you here back from them and they will give good news.", "I'm still friends with my old roommate, but I found other people to spend my time with.", "Nice, I hope you have a great time at the party! Have some fun for the both of us!", "Thats wonderful. Oddly shaped Christmas presents usually make you want to open them EARLY just to get a peak :)", "Maybe an airhorn or something would spook him off. Dogs tend not to like loud sounds, after all.", "Wow! You are already super successful! I hope you help them kids!", "that is bad . goodness the nerve of some people.", "Aww, I am so glad that you were able to find him again! A dog truly is a man's best friend.", "Well that's good. I'm glad so far it has worked out :)", "Ain't that a whopping , I would have comp;ained to somebody about it.", "As I a child I imagine that would be incredibly scary. How did you find them again?>", "Oh gross, makes me never want McDonalds again.", "Wow. I am disappointed in you too, you monster :(", "I get that. My sister broke my favorite coffee mug.", "Dang! Your dog must have been so excited to see you come back!", "Oh no, how did he take it?", "Yeah, I can relate to that. I hate feeling like I don't know what dangerous marine life could be around me.", "Aww, that's tremendous. Those are big steps, but if ever there is a good-sign of a relationship, it's when those topics are approached happily. Congratulations!", "haha, yeah I know what you ean, but at least you know it is fresh!", "Could be either!", "Oh god, I hate bugs!", "Well that's good. Hopefully didn't take long to open up roads.", "I bet you guys had a lot of catching up to do!", "My dog needs some good training!", "That's a good friends right there. Looking out for your best interests is a sign that they're truly a keeper.", "Aw, that just shows that he is a great friend. Maybe you can treat him to lunch for the rest of the week for taking the fall for you. I am sure he would really appreciate that :)", "That's great, nothing better :)", "For sure. I luckily have not had anyone cheat on me.", "Can you facetime them?", "I had to borrow money to get a second degree. Hurt my pride, but it's okay.", "Nice what show?", "Oh my goodness! That happens to me often. I just get distracted with whatever is playing in front of me and eat everything in my hands!", "That's not cool!  I hope you did well in spite of not having your lucky pencil.  Siblings can be quite pesky at times!", "Well, I hope it does not happen again!", "A stripper, I see. Well what she does not know will not hurt her.", "I know someone with that. She might need some medication.", "Oh, Congrats on your newborn.", "Are you still friends?", "I hope you are in some therapy. That can take a toll on the average person.", "I agree. I am watching pictures of it right now", "Wow. That is incredibly romantic. You're a lucky girl!", "Mine passed away too. She was a great woman.", "I bet they love games.", "Your dog must be very healthy !", "You are much better off", "I would love some of that right now.", "Dang! I hope you got them big discounts before you ordered them!", "I have a few bears.", "I'm sorry. Maybe she just needs time to process things.", "Dang, it must have been embarassing", "Oh no. That sounds awful. I'm sorry to hear abut your friend. Is he better now?", "That is good", "how was the weather?", "Oh, then its okay", "oh sweet, how many do you own now?", "My cat is doing good. : ) He's gained some weight, since I trimmed his fur. NO more hairballs.", "That may be gross, but she is just putting effort into her appearnce.", "oh man that sounds embarrassing. I would've just run out of the store and country", "You should be able to trust that he won't do anything shady when he talks to other girls. If you can't trust him then that might mean you need to reevaluate your relationship with him.", "Wishing you all the best!!", "It must be nice to be in trusting and safe relationship like that.", "Who are they you are referring", "I wish I had a cool friend like you!", "You two are lucky to have each other!", "I would too.  I have lost things before and never had anyone turn them in and its not a good feeling.", "Dang! Maybe you can send me some too", "I am too scared of getting scammed from those", "I heard it is one of the best games of this generation!", "and what was that?", "That is the thing about athletes, it is crazy how gifted they are compared to an average person.", "Yes your a lucky person and I'm happy for you.", "Wow, you must be very proud of her", "Dang, well I hope these things don't happen again!", "That is incredible , my dad had canswer and we had people from our church pray for him and others did as well and his cancer went into remission.", "It sounds like you really care about her. I hope everything works out great for you guys!", "Aw, I love that he had you there with him when it happened. I bet that made it feel a bit better for him", "That is truly amazing! I wish you the best of luck! And I am sure she loves you still!", "I imagine. I left my parents and my country when I was 25 years old.", "HJow do you put up with it , I Know I could not do it.", "That is very unfortunate, I hope things turn around for you my friend!", "Wow, he is super rude! Beat him up!", "Yup, time goes by too fast!", "That is true. And the mistake would not happen again so you do not have to worry about that", "Love her while you can and enjoy your life together. Children grow up fast, i have two, a six year old girl and a nine year old boy. They are handfuls", "You should keep your head down, not make eye contact, and make a mean face! He won't call on you then!", "You deserve a raise for that mentality", "Absolutely! And I am sure next time you will be able to finish", "Well I hope he learns his lesson!", "What do you plan to do", "yeah you clearly are well read. what does he study?", "Nice, I hope I can overcome my fear one day too!", "haha I wish it was that simple", "I understand. Just be supportive as your girlfriend is probably thinking the same thing. Just remember you are now both in this together so enjoy the experience.", "Sounds hard! I hope you do well in your exams!", "I bet!", "Oh man! I hope it all works out for you.", "well maybe you should find another job", "What can you do to help him stop drinking", "Dang, well I hope she has a wonderful future!", "I am sure everything will work out just fine!", "The same habit that I took up", "Well that might explain it, those zombies aren't very nice!", "What kind of dog is she?", "Oh no thats pretty gross! I hope that is not true, because if it is that is gross.", "Parents always think they know best. Until their children prove them wrong they tend to think that.", "As you're hopeful, you will get it", "well you better make sure of that. tell him if he forgets again you'll divorce him", "well , that's insane! i'm glad you find you life partner , and i hope everything goes the way you guys planned !", "Exactly! that is a great outlook to have. You did your best and as long as you are happy personally all the rest does not matter", "Yeah, but sometimes these things can't be avoided.", "You get relaxed and even get more productive when you get back to work.", "That is wonderful! I wish you and your family the best! Sending positive energy, love, and light your way.", "Sometimes things are a necessary evil. And who knows as long as you keep your options open the perfect job may be right around the corner.", "i hope that you didn't get hurt", "On my 30th birthday, my wife bought me my dream car. A Jeep. I never saw it coming.", "she probably appreciate you so much for doing that.", "Our second family dog died last year. She was the runt of the litter, so it was a surprise since she was a small dog.", "That's so cool, I'm sure he'll love it and make some great friends!", "Well then maybe it is time to get rid of them?", "That is unfortunate, but funny at the same time!", "maybe you should ask i think that's the easiest way of discovering what is better for you!", "oh, I understand. Was it a long interview?", "Uhnnn,most of us did!", "You monster! Everyone loves animals", "You are living life.", "Dang, that is very unfortunate.", "I hope you are right.", "Was the drive a necessary one to take?", "Did you have a sum inside?", "Yes a boss who is helpful and has a good attitude will have earned my loyalty from the beginning.  The better I feel about work the better I perform in the long run.", "Perfect state of mind.  I will take that any day.", "well, you know everything happens for a reason.", "What made you do that?", "What a shame. I wouldn't make them my partner again. (and I might venture so far as to notify the professor)", "At least he lived a long, happy life.", "see? they can't get mad at you so you shoudn't feel ashamed, instead search for another job and help them.", "It pays to always be kind. Even if you don't get rewarded immediately but at least you helped someone.", "you don't deserve a best friend like that. or even a relationship where you have to keep fighting for the attention. i suggest you leave both of them and look for your future with other people!", "She was a keeper though, I'm sure it was worth it for him.", "oh I see. do you have kids together", "Hopefully!", "Cool, I never played the drums. My band teacher in middle school tried to discourage playing the drums cause there are no notes!", "well hopefully you won't die. be careful and make sure you have fun!", "Oh, I'm so sorry that happened to you. I really hope you were able to get the color fixed eventually.", "Oh wow....I hope you can get through it.", "I would have switched schools if I were you. I would hate to have to be with bullies like that", "I hope she didn't make you feel too bad about it! People make mistakes when they're young.", "The plus side about schools is that someone else will do something that everyone will focus on soon enough.", "I stepped on my uncle's fishing pole, kinda hard to tell if it catches fish worse or not.", "I'm glad y'all were able to make it through such a hard time.", "Yes, we can truly not judge people because unless you are very close with a person you can't know their full story!", "I am so sorry for your loss.  It can be a relief to know he isn't in pain.  I felt the same way when I lost my Aunt last year.  She was like a mom to me.", "That's funny and unfortunate at the same time. I really hope your son was okay and not too traumatised by the experience!", "that's good I have 2 teenage daughters and dread the idea of leaving them by themselves", "10 years of teaching experience, I'm sure you'll end up having a great year!

If you focus on the things you can control, then it might stop the negative feelings about things you can't control", "Wow, well he will have to learn his lesson before he will get a job or go to college. That won't work there.", "well you should be more worried about dying in a car accident, because that's 10x more likely. drive safe", "That's great, my one son spent time in a childrens hospital and the care was fantastic could not have been happier with them", "I suppose as long as they're happy that's the main thing!

Pepperoni is by far my favourite", "It certainly will.", "Crazy world we live in.", "Did you try to apologise before she hit you, or did you not have time?", "But you can make arrangements such that you see him every weekend.", "I think if you're respectful and state what you did wrong and how you'll fix it, she will forgive you.", "oh my god, how embarrassing was that?", "It sounds like you really have had a good life so far! It makes me feel happy hearing good news stories like this", "Oh yeah, you must be a brilliant student", "That was really nice of her to get it for you.

The causes are many.", "oh, it was an accident, and it's alright. as long as you make sure that you use the right seasoning next time. it's all gonna be okay.", "This is a lot to ask for. I recommend going straight to the pope for something of this magnitude", "Well, I hope they can trace it for you. Better late than never. I wish you good luck with that!", "I very much agree! Being grateful is important, it keeps you level headed and grounded in life!", "that's great, glad you managed to make everything okay afterwards, that must've been a lot of hard work!", "That's a relief. You have the people who matter safe and sound, the stuff can be replaced in time.", "Thats women for you.Where you frugal with money?", "That's incredible, well done!

Sounds like you really miss your sweet beast!", "I hope that you can find a solution to help with that. Good luck!", "People do change a lot when they grow up.

I'm sure something similar will come up soon though", "That's good then, as long as no one waa hurt! was he drunk?", "Have you always been very trusting?", "That is a legit lunch.  Solid choices.  A+  would eat.", "Haha! I think a lot of people can probably relate to that. I'm sure she appreciates it!", "I can see how it would make you anxious.", "It is good that you enjoy your alone time. Sometimes we just need a little me-time.", "My daughter got scared of haunted house once. It was hilarious, but I sympathise with her and you.", "I wouldn't have been able to either! It's super gross!", "I would feel the same way.  Perhaps you could mention it to your co-worker nicely and they will take pity on you.", "Those vacuums are amazing and are one of a kind. You should get it!", "Nice! you are a lucky lady.", "I hope one day you can find a solution and get back to being the old you.", "Congrats because I know you will definitely overcome the pains", "That's awesome!

I wish I could try it out for myself. How long have you been doing it now?", "that's too cool I would love to get a puppy some day", "oh no. so what do you do in such instance?", "I believe that's for the best. You should get regularly tested after this. I hope the best for you.", "I am glad you escaped it", "Uh oh. I hope whoever saw it had a little chuckle then let it go. It's no big deal.", "Your heart was in the right place. It sad that children can't be fed in our world today. Maybe one day nobody will have to be hungry.", "OK, now I understand. Maybe she later got a ride home", "Wow! I can't even do that now! I bet you are very proud of her.", "That must be so infuriating. I'd get upset if it were me.", "Hey that's awesome. And you're right it doesn't, so live it up my friend!", "She'll forgive you eventually. You'll never make the same mistake again I promise you that!", "Husbands can be so thoughtful...

Everybody loves a little extra money!", "I guess not, but I hope you still had (or will have if it hasn't happened yet) a great wedding!", "Thank goodness. Do you know who he was?", "Understandable, when you put so much work into something only to be eclipsed by someone else. Not a good feeling.", "Always!", "At least it wasn't something you did on purpose. I'm sure it will blow over!", "Yeah I would be a little horrified too if my cat did that!

I hope you stay happy always.", "Lets hope it will trace the house back", "It can be frightening, especially with all those new classmates and teachers.", "It's never fun to see your significant other around someone they used to date. At least he is with you now and I'm sure you have nothing to worry about!", "I'm so happy you were able to get a dependable vehicle. I always have someone come with me as well. It's nice to have a second pair of eyes.", "When my relatives have died, it helps me to remember the good times, and makes me smile instead of being sad", "I am so sorry, that is so tragic. At least you have some good memories with him.", "Yes, it's true in life too when you grow up, sometimes the best family has nothing to do with blood relations.", "Yeah hopefully all the hoopla over the first day distracted everyone. I am sorry that happened to you though.", "I am glad you are okay. I wrecked my favorite car 3 years ago and I still miss it.", "Oh wow, I can only imagine.  Paperwork is not fun.  I hope you got it all done eventually!", "Uhmnnn!", "Wow, that is true love", "It will help you,  even in blood circulation", "What did you do?

I'm sorry that happened to you.", "Thats great, says a lot about the type of person you are, in a good way! I probably would've gone for revenge knowing myself.", "That's great that you have that type of relationship with him. My husband and I approach things together and discuss everything, which works great for us. You have to do what works for you and your relationship.", "That will be really convenient.  There's one near us we like to skateboard to.", "Wow, no power at home is terrible. What would we do without electricity?!", "Aww, that's cute!

Did you get bruised up?", "I got some bad grades in college and told my parents I was doing better than I was. I know how ashamed I felt at that time too.", "Fair enough. $100 can be made easily; a watch with sentimental value is priceless.", "I agree with you.

I suggest doing online surveys to make some extra cash  ;)", "This is the earliest they've ever started here.", "I know what you mean. We are only lucky enough to travel local.", "Ah, that happens.  Again, very sorry. Maybe you can find the silver lining in it. Or, find a new job and get a fresh start somewhere else.", "Aww, that's disappointing. Sorry to hear that.", "It does. I just got a new kitten a few weeks ago. It helps to have her to cuddle with.", "Oh I'm sorry to hear that. Still, onwards and upwards.

We will always have good memories to remember though, and thats what matters the most.", "That should help with the cost then. How much money do you need to save?", "Wow!  Sounded like a real breeze!  What did you write about?", "If I lost mine hiking I would for sure think it was gone forever.  Hopefully they didnt cancel too many cards before you got it back to them!", "Maybe you should try introducing yourself to your neighbors.  Or look online for meetups for hobbies that you're interested in.", "Yea those out of state fees can be ridiculous. Best of luck to you!", "Awww, have you adopted any that you brought in?", "With that kind of confidence, you should be a shoe-in for the promotion!", "Oh nice, they can be so sweet and gentle.", "It probably is, at least you get to experience another culture.", "are they carrot flowers?", "Yes, everyone does. that was really brave of you!", "i dont have a PS4, alot of people play fortnite. is that a cool game?", "Wow.

We all make mistakes. It's the human condition.", "I'm glad you have something to remind you of them!", "Yes it does. The DMV has the longest wait times.

That does sound like an amazing car!", "Went through Irma last year. We sat it out too.", "That's good, I know what it's like when you can't get a shift covered and your just understaffed and scrambling the whole day.", "Absolutely.

So glad you had her there.  Wish she didn't get hurt though.", "Good for you! Get it done!", "That is kinda odd but im glad you are happy!", "I see. Have you tried talking to your neighbor about it?", "I dont think I would have been brave enough to  do that", "That sounds like it will be so fun! I bet you all have a fabulous time.", "Can you go to the store and get some more before she notices?", "fat and sassy too", "Yes I have been in that situation. Just stay positive.", "Oh yikes that's awful", "How long since you've seen her?", "O no I hope you tried to stop him", "Yeah that is usually how it goes", "ah snap!", "Oh no! We do need to hurry then don't we?", "Sometimes its just a phase or maybe the group of people are not making an effort to make you feel included? I am sorry I know how that feels.", "It's always a blessing to have certain times in life where no problems are occurring!", "i bet you had no problems, dogs are easy to take care of, they blindly accept anything", "Absolutely! Trusting your partner is so important.", "I hope so too! Good luck. :D", "Absolutely couldnt agree more.", "Oh my goodness, I can only imagine how horrible that was for you.", "That is a victory! Those pesky parking tickets can be a pain sometimes!", "Yeah that seems like the best thing to do", "It's all about what you do with those bumps and just pushing through them I think.", "that is good to hear,  there are always kind people out there to help", "I can't imagine what you're going through. That must be extremely hard.", "Yeah. Pushy salespeople are so annoying though! They accomplish the opposite of their goal when they become too overpowering over their customers.", "Yeah i would not think about it to much.", "I see! Well self-exploration and reflection is usually really productive!", "Yeah i would have yelled at him", "That sound like a very useful gift that you'll use a lot in the course of a day.", "That is really cool, everyone should do something like that", "my daughter just had her 2nd such happy", "Well that sounds like fun to me.", "Yeah i bet it was a long long drive", "That's a great attitude to have! Positivity is always a great quality to have.", "That's an incredible blessing that they love you. Some people have different opinions about that so your lucky you come rom a supportive family.", "oh no, is there any way you can file a complaint against him? And it's the same guy?! So weird!!!", "Yeah i know but atleast you have memories of him", "That's hysterical!  It was definitely a unique prize then.", "Aw, that's very sweet!

I bet live actors really enhance the experience!", "I'm sorry man. You can reach out to me anytime.", "oh boy", "I am sure it did and I know you will treasure that mug.

He should probably get that checked out by a doctor. It's best to check out these things I think.", "Well maybe your boss was one of them and you get some brownie points for trying to get to work quickly", "That is awesome! Im glad it worked out", "Oh, that's cool! How many do you have?", "oh i bet", "Do you have fond memories of it>", "I wish your friends mom all the best. A miracle could happen!", "Yeah it must have been!", "Ouch! That sounds painful. You poor thing.", "You may feel a little guilty and I understand that, Maybe run to the store and pick up more?", "Nice! That is a good role! Do you like a leadership position?", "That's awful, I hope things get better for you.", "That's no fair.  Your friend will never know.", "And did it not go over well?", "Well that's great,  Someone you trust too.", "Sometimes all we have is our memories.", "Oh no.  That didn't go well then.  Look for a ring next time.", "That's so sweet of you!", "THat must be tough to deal with.  I cant imagine losing a parent!", "Taht sounds lucrative! I have a place in Big sky MT. it worked out very wellas far as renting.", "Ah-ha! Do you know anyone in your family who's good at bargaining? Maybe the sales-person is a hard-bargainer.", "She totally knew! I guess it's flattering to know your partner is good looking enough to have a woman stare him down like that.", "I usually deal with it by not going to the pound anymore to look.   I had a dog die in a house fire not long ago and I am just not ready for a dog.", "Oh gosh. That's terrifying! I don't know anyone who likes those kind of movies!!", "Nice. I would like to do the same, but it is very expensive where I live. I hope I can afford it one day.", "Yay! It's BEAUTIFUL. If you go, you will love it.", "Same. It's hard to predict.", "How much stuff did you have to go through?", "See things work out well when you make doing the right thing a priority. I am glad you followed through on it", "WOW that's so convienient.", "Wholesaling would be an great options. You could go on Youtube and find tons of videos about flipping homes with no money.. but if your brother has a little change.. Well.. Go Brother! lol", "No problem I got faith in you, really enjoyed this chat", "That's so cute! Turtles running around?! Haha!! I have a rabbit, he loves to hop around my house too!", "I hear you.  Technology is supposed to make things simpler.  Not always the case.", "Well I'm pleased to hear you had a fun time. Hope you get to do it again soon.", "Wow it must have been good feeling", "That is so sad. Did you see it happen?", "sorry. Probably the driver did not see her", "all the best", "i bet .Next time call the people in charge", "I see. Well, I hope all you got was a ticket.", "Thats worrying, she need help", "I'm sorry you felt that way. Is it any better now?", "That's good. you must have been surprised by the confession.", "I hope you have as much fun as he does!", "Well at least you were able to introduce him to your friend. I hope everything works out for him!", "That stinks , cheer up and try again", "I never did go to a preacher.", "I won't tell anyone! Come on, just one juicy detail??", "That's good.  I'm glad you had good doctors to help you get back on your feet (no pun intended).  Are you having o be out of work?", "You should've made them buy another cake!", "thats awesome, im glad they were helpful!", "I'm so happy to hear that! Practice does make perfect.", "Oh no! Well you better spend as much time with her as you can now. It could be any time she leaves. Oh what a heard situation you are going through! If you need a friend I am always here for you.", "Yeah I can understand, it's definitely a pleasant surprise.", "That's so true, life is very fragile and I find it easy to forget that.", "Why did you choose to stay?", "Omg! Okay now I understand how difficult it really must be for you!", "I can just imagine, maybe she wanted a bath. Glad to know she wasn't harmed.", "That's not very nice. I think it is just better to be honest, even if it might hurt.", "You can always improve that anytime you want to.  I have faith in you.", "I mean its pretty crappy to take anything from anyone, but hes your brother so it is slightly less crappy as long as you pay him back!", "Unfortunately he wins out when you do that because it will likely continue.  Again, I wish you had been treated so unkindly.", "Whoops! Did she take it with anything approaching a sense of humor?", "Yuck! You better put a trap up there. You know they have these wireless web cams these days for really cheap so it may be a good idea to get one of those so you know for sure if you have an infestation.", "I would be upset as well", "The more hands, the quicker the work!", "No problem!", "It's hard to condense a pep talk into nice little one liners. But I think if you just go for it, breathe deeply a bunch, and pretend it's just you in that room, I think you'll do great!", "that is the problem with cheating, you have to live with it especially if you have a conscious, all I can say is to use this promotion as a lesson to better prepare yourself next time", "I get that. I don't respond well when people are rude to me.", "Oops, sorry, I didn't finish my thought.  I think they make enough money to handle it and that inconvenience is worth $80.  Plus now you'll definitely buy again with them so I think it works in their favor and yours!", "Now you just have to keep up that same energy all year, that's the difficult part.", "Does your insurance have the new care replacement  option?", "You should make it an annual trip!  Then you can always be reminded of a good time in your life.", "Most places will make her replace the 10 so you should really go back to there and explain what happened", "Awww well other than the heart attack giving sounds like a cute cat", "I feel your pain. I hope you had someone to lean on.", "Awesome. I love my mate too. That coworker is very out of order!", "That's great to hear. It sounds like it's a well needed change. Things will look up from here!", "That's great.  Its good to have a friend you can trust that much.", "I hope you make the right choice!", "Maybe you should contact the news about it", "Wow you should probably tell her so that lies and decent don't become commonplace in your marriage.", "Yeah people like that are jerks", "Ah. You must do it more often. Children are so precious.", "Yeah, I wouldn't feel to good about myself either but at least no one got hurt including yourself.", "I can understand why it would be a little nerve wracking but I am glad you caught up with him", "Were there any recent events in your neighborhood that would make you worry?", "that is sad that they cant atleast talk to you", "Oops!  Well, just hold your head high because things happen to all of us and it doesn't speak to who you are as a person so just let it roll off your chest.  Shame that people are decent enough to help.", "Just try to stay positive and get a good night's rest the night before and I'm sure you'll do amazing! Just have to go in with confidence.", "That sounds delicious! Can I come over?", "That just warms my heart, thank you for telling me that.", "We don't get them too often, here. Though there's usually a few tornadoes that touch down somewhere in the area, each year.", "Does your high school do reunions where you could see them again?", "I am so glad to hear that. A healthy puppy makes everyone happy.", "Everything about getting something new like that is fun!", "Its always good to think about such moments, I wish I could go back to these times.", "You must be so proud of him!", "Its paying off!  That's awesome. How much can you bench?", "Haha, Good for her! She is becomeing more independent! Do you know what kind of car?", "I know how you feel.  I've got old rifles from both of my grand fathers... along with some WW II bring backs.  I don't think I could sell them.", "I had no idea snakes even lived that long. I am sure he was a faithful buddy to you.", "You should take a ride with her and try to get her to paralell park in a tight space or something", "I will. I bet my aunt has some things to give me.", "I wish I could say the same. I am addicted. :(", "That must be somewhat frustrating at times.", "I hope it starts to not hurt so much. I always take forever to stop hurting from those things.", "Totally! I also have a very trusting family.", "I guess they don't see it as just copy paper. To them stealing is stealing no matter how petty. At least you have the chance to change your ways and keep your job.", "I am glad you have all the support you need. The important thing is your family is safe.", "I am so sorry.  That is awful. Definitely look into your rights as an accepted student who was counting on that and made all your plans around it.", "Yep, thats what I did with the chair mine messed up pretty bad.", "It's going to knock everyone dead! I'll be rooting for you", "Oh know. I am sure your mother will forgive you. I was an accident and we all have accidents sometimes.", "I love dogs! I am thinking of getting another one.", "It must have been so aggravating. I hope the due date wasn't the next day!", "Waiting is the worst!  Well, whatever happens is meant to be.  I wish you luck and success with your house!", "That's really great! Your kids will thank you for giving them that important lesson.", "I'm sure it will!", "Aw I am sure you will be good parent to all of them. Kids are the greatest joy in life.", "That is so nice I wish I had a car like that.", "I hope so too. Its really annoying when that happens and just ruins your day.", "I think you will do great!", "hahaha I can imagine! I guess I would have done the same. I hope you got him back. Heehee", "And you know when men get sick, they act like they are dying.", "Wow, that stinks. Hopefully she will be there for you next time if you ever need help again.", "That's great. It's nice to have family around that can help pick you up when you feel down.", "That is so sweet. Family is very important", "That's an interesting experience!", "I'm sorry to hear that. 10 is still very young though so I hope you have plenty of more time to spend with her.", "Ugh, well I hope the best for you, that it is all nice and intact when you get back.", "Oh dear. Maybe you were just a bit impatient but I am sure he will forgive you", "Have fun spending it!", "Did you retaliate against your boss?", "Looks like it was just an accident. It happens and you shouldn't blame yourself for it.", "If you could speak with someone that work there you could learn more about what to expect and what things they value the most, but you certainly seem very prepared.", "No, I'm not. I'm hopeful that the deniers will start to come to their senses and maybe we can slow the warming of the earth.", "That is a long time to suffer. It seems like it is a new day for you.", "I agree.  Be there no matter what.  I hope she heals quickly.", "That's awesome. That's a good amount for a little effort which is always nice.", "must be great to have that feeling of accomplishment and independent.", "Ahhh, oh well. Don't beat yourself up. I am pretty sure that I have done something like that before too. I think it was with birthday cake. I love birthday cake!!!!!", "It's a huge commitment for him and you! If you don't think you can do it, I wouldn't sign him up. There's no shame in that!", "That must have made you feel pretty nostalgic!", "That is just the worst feeling. Part of the reason I work from home", "Well for your sake I hope it gets taken care of soon.", "Did it start back up? Glad you were able to start over.", "yes they deserve respect unless they do soemthing cruel.", "That's very sad.  I'm sure he'll be back to visit.", "lol, well hope she doesnt notice", "Yeah I completely understand that.", "Yea it sucks to go but feels great once you leave.", "Agreed, what was your favorite memory?", "You are an honest man as well. I salute you! A rare breed indeed.", "Wow I didn't know you could litter train rabbits. It's always challenging house training a new pet. I hope he learns quick!", "I can imagine. I would have lost my appetite for sure. That is a crazy story!", "I totally get that! I am still trying to pay off my student loans.", "I could see that... Yeah. Well, I hope you are able to re-invest that energy into your own passions. I think you could do a lot for yourself.", "I see, at least you are getting professional help with your problem.", "Have a beer for me too.", "LOL man that's... I don't even know what to say.", "Did you tell your husband?", "That is so nice, the good thing is you arrived safely.", "To be fair, travelling is expensive and probably overrated to a certain extent. I hope you do find the time to take some time away from work so you can enjoy yourself though.", "Wow I'm glad you are safe though. Do you know what started it?", "Thank God! It can be heart wrenching when your pet is in danger.", "Let's hope this politician is honorable in other ways as well!", "my favorite is california roll", "I love my mom very much too!", "Well cheers to her! That is a great accomplishment!", "Just remember to be a gentleman.", "Good job!

You have to be more careful.", "Yeah, that sounds like an easy car to drive. I will send out some good vibes for you. good luck!", "Sounds like you have quite the job on your hands! Hopefully it tastes great and you have a great meal.", "No worries! That's so awesome. Are you taking lessons from a musician in a class, one on one, or online?", "I hope you both stay healthy!", "You shouldn't that could happen to the best of us.", "That was really nice of you. Your friend is lucky to have you!", "Do you have any major bills coming up?", "Yea it will be unfair for the cat too who may feel lonely and unloved. You should tell him to be more responsible before he can get a pet.", "That sounds awesome. I hope everyone is prepared for the next step so that you guys can keep getting better.", "You totally should call a friend. I usually enjoy my alone time also but it is nice to have company around.", "that's really good keep doing a good job okay", "Well, I want you to know that it WILL be okay. I was scared to death when I found out I was pregnant with my first one, and it was really hard, but everything worked out and he is over 18 now and moved out. Also, if you decide that you don't want to keep the baby there are lots of options available too.", "Tragic, I'd be more annoyed at losing my food I think.", "It is always good to have a pleasant relationship with your parents.", "i hope you all have a wonderful time", "That is about as far away as you can move, I am sorry to hear that, hope everything works out!", "I agree, is you are not happy in a relationship anymore you should first end it and only after be with someone else.", "Haha, so you told a fib. Ain't nothing wrong with that.", "Well have fun on the triple black diamond!", "That sounds like a great time! It's always good to do those things with friends.", "He might just be bluffing. Unless someone broke into your house?", "That must have been a nice moment.", "I understand that, I get that could make you emotional, I hope time slows for you!", "That's horrible.  Please accept my condolences for you and his family.  Take care of yourselves and let yourselves grieve.", "Did you try this stuff called GOOF OFF? Give that a try or some vinegar.", "Me too. I love to ponder about the good ole days. Did you share the photos with your friends or parents?", "I hate when I do that, but it is better for it to be cooked to long, than not long enough....", "That is amazing. I hope I can get the family together soon.", "You better prepare well for that final.", "It sounds like it will, i hope you have  a great dinner!", "That's a good thing to be financially prepared, trust me.  My husband and I spent most of the money we had on a honeymoon and then struggled for years doing things the wrong way. You're smart!", "Good i bet you deserved it. :)", "I hope so too, you should have reported it to a supervisor or manager.", "Well I guess you should probably find a new job before quitting your present job.", "I do not blame you one bit!", "lucky you , i was bit a few times but it was my fault i provoked the dogs", "You should go in a play some!", "That's good! At least it's someone you can trust instead of a stranger at a daycare center.", "That sounds so painful! I hope it gets better fast.", "Good luck!", "I am sure you will be OK. The doctors can be very scary sometimes but most people get scared about things that aren't worth it.", "wow that is a long time, but remember you had great experience with her and will have fond memories for the rest of you life", "I can't help but be a little jealous. haha", "I can see how that would be really annoying. Just nod and say yeah. Thats what works for me.", "That's great!  I'm sure he appreciated that you trusted him.", "Now you will have to really be careful what you say around him. They tend to repeat everything they hear when you least suspect it.", "I bet you are so happy you stuck with it.. definitely something to be proud of.", "That is very thoughtful of you. You are a good sister!", "Yeah, I think her parents or her peers, or even herself probably, may put  a lot of expectations on her. While you want to reassure and encourage her, it's good to not make her plan too far ahead in the future and put all that weight on her. It's what my parents did with me, and I resented them for it.", "Yes what I thought,  I guess your roommate must have been more embarrassed.", "At least now a ways you can face time or call her to at least stay in contact.", "Me either. I've always been a fairly clean person. Had to move out of my parents home for college, and both roommates I've had have been kind of messy. I don't know how people don't feel weird and uncomfortable making other people live in/clean up their mess.", "Haha wow, thats cool.", "That is awesome, I remember Odell Beckham doing that a few years ago.", "If your best friend is truly a best friend of yours, they won't leave you over this. It isn't right to tell his girlfriend in my opinion, but it is good if you speak to him about the situation.", "Nice! I asdly am a corn husker. it's been a rough couple of years.", "It sounds like you have a great family!", "Environmental Engineering - my second engineering degree", "Wow! congrats and keep it up. I know it helps me to stay really busy.", "Aw it must have felt so nostalgic going through old memories. Its nice to cherish them.", "Be sure to facetime or skype with him. That will help with the loneliness.", "This is such a difficult thing for you to go through.  I hope he learns from this and changes his path.", "I understand. But you must cherish every moment because soon our babies grow up and become great adults.", "I don't blame you, I wouldn't want to mess with that either.", "Oh, I see. Yeah, it kind of stinks being around people who can afford things you would like. But maybe you can view it as you being more mindful and responsible with your money.", "If you did have to move, might I suggest Boston as an alternative?", "Oh good, then there is nothing you should be worried about then. :) Go relax and distract your mind on something else. All will work out my friend.", "Oh wow, that's really far! Well I hope you get to go soon and have a safe trip!", "Yup! I am sure you guys will get through it!", "Sleep is so important before an exam, that's where all your facts and memories get better organized", "I see. You shouldn't let it spoil your plans. Go and have fun but take a rain coat with you!", "Oh, I see. I give my dogs popcorn and they love it!", "I understand, I have 4 cats myself. The oldest is 14.", "haha good job man. Keep up the good work!", "Haha I hear you there, that stuff is potent", "Man.. I wish I could join you in the no debt part. That sounds like it took a lot of work. You're reaping the rewards. I hope things continue to stay stable for you, and you can keep it going until setting up a good retirement.", "I bet, I wouldn't be able to sleep after either.", "Maybe turn on the TV and find a show about dogs. He might be too distracted to bark.", "Hahaha that's funny. Sorry but i find that hilarious.", "Go get them my friend!! I know you can do it!", "That sounds like a really cool profession", "Oh.. well that complicates things. Yeah, maybe that will make you seriously examine things. I think you're okay as long as you don't do anything while still in a relationship. But if you feel your current one is lacking something, and your eye is wandering, you owe it to yourself and your current boyfriend to reflect on why that is, and if there can be improvements, or if you should both move on.", "Maybe you just need to give her some space. Women tend to pull back when they feel like they are being smothered. Either it works or she moves on. No matter which happens you know.", "It would be pretty embarrassing too if it happened as an adult..... and I guess pretty funny watching it too.", "You guys sound a lot like us. Glad to see that long distance can work for a change. It takes strong, honest, communicative people. It gets a bad reputation sometimes, when it shouldn't. I hope we end up like you guys and can end the long distance thing soon, though. Gets a little stale.", "maybe the suspect something and want to talk to you about it. or maybe it's nothing. try not to let it drive you crazy. i know it's easier said than done.", "Why wouldn't you pass it to'em? Is he a bad shot and you don't want to tell'em?", "That is very kind of you, how old is your daughter now?", "I hope the braves make it all the way!", "sounds like you do have a great life!", "That's a great attitude. You will be fine, and can use this as a learning experience", "thank you for his sacrifice and service! it is greatly appreciated!", "Yes, things are looking quite good and will only get better from here.", "Yeah, remembering old times with a good friends is always fun!", "Wow you must come from a very rich family, that must be nice.", "You could have reminisced with an airsoft sniper from a safe distance.", "I can understand the feeling, I think you'll get in though!", "Did you call the police or just let it go?", "Maybe you can keep the cat and have him move out.", "It's going to be really easy to see that he is special to you guys after tonight. I wish I had a friend like you, even though I don't like surprises. You should be proud of yourself. I hope it goes smoothly!", "thats a good feeling, i wish yall the best", "I sure am. Im a New Orleans Saints fan. Im hoping for a good year also.", "Wow. That is a long time to be waiting for a movie.", "Flowers are definitely beautiful.", "i'm sorry about that! hopefully that kid has learned better by now", "Ah great. Good luck. Are they good?", "I'm sure you will! I bet you will do great things after school!", "That is so scary, I am glad that you are okay! People are so crazy!!!", "I have never been. I would love to though. I hope you have a great time back at home.", "Well that's your choice, but I say new adventures in life are profitable!", "Great :)", "oh im sorry to hear that! i hope it all works out for the best!", "Sounds like you deserved that promotion.", "That is very helpful! I am glad you were able to get that discount.", "She must be very intelligent! I hear that is one of the hardest degrees to get. Incredible!", "Sounds painful, hopefully she recovers well", "That sounds so lovely", "Me neither! That is pretty cool.

No one stands a chance!", "Once you're ready, adopt a dog from the shelter in his honor.", "When did you get it?", "Unfortunately I don't but I have a brother who loves to play it.", "i'm sorry to hear that! are you ok?", "That's a lot of money. Best of luck to you!", "That's so cool! I'd like to work in a hospital some day. But for now.. we can finally relax because it's the weekend!!", "figures, right?", "thats awesome! i hope that feeling continues!", "its a big ambition but you can do it with the right effort and commitment!", "The news can be so dark and depressing at times.", "It is alright. being paranoid has its benefits. it will make you study more.", "That is the best thing to have in life. Not much else matters in my opinion.", "I'm sorry! I meant to say that was so sweet of you. It's good that he has a good friend like you.", "Are they males or females?", "Understandably so. But hey, we all make mistakes and failing one class isn't the end of the world. In fact I failed Calculus 3 this semester. So take pride in what you have accomplished and just work hard next semester!", "I haven't, but I will check it out!", "It is great, I'm excited to see what the future has to offer.", "I wonder how a person can do that to a child.", "Dang, i have doen the same. it can be pretty embarrasing.", "Ugh, that's not great though.  But, yes, it could be a lot worse like across the country long.", "Good for you, you have your priorities straight!", "It is still a bugatti!!!", "Very nice, you should hold onto that girl.  Did you ask her to marry you on the spot?", "im sorry to hear that", "Not a whole lot you can do besides make their day a little better which you have already done. They're in there to heal or get better hopefully.", "I'm sure her doctors will do a good job.", "Congrats! What college did you choose?", "Yeah, it's also kind of disgusting how much the news plays those stories up, because they know it garners views. The kind of if it bleeds, it leads idea. But I guess we're the people that eat it up and make them do that.", "You are right being that age he will probably never change", "Right! Well I'd say try to get to know a few people really well that have common interests!", "Yes I have a pet Labrador back home. I miss spoiling him with treats so much.", "wow what a steal", "Don't feel bad.  Everybody does it bro! If you ain't cheatin, you ain't tryin!", "I'm sorry that happened! At least you didn't get fired", "I agree. These people deserve to be punished for preying on innocent civilians.", "That is a tough field to work in, alot of people rely on you", "I understand. He will most probably forget about it.", "Well the alcohol in it will paralyze it enough for you to be able to kill it!!", "Yep, I just feel it was a simpler time back then. Nowadays many of us just live in fear of one another.", "I'm sure that was a wise thing to do.  You saved yourself a world of pain!  Wouldn't it be nice if those things worked out?", "well hopefully it is", "That is good! What kind of car?", "I agree, I try not to think about that, hopefully they will learn to treat others better.", "So happy for you! That is a very noble job. I think more women should be more interested in staying home with the children. I think the children would benefit so much.", "That is terrifying! i don't do haunted houses lol", "That is really great. I enjoy a baseball game now and then.", "Don't tell her right after she awakes up.

I've been there and it's hard not to think about anything else. I really wish you the very best", "That's so cool.  I think I would feel the same way, except I was dumb in my 20s and still have student debt!  lol", "That is crazy!  There has to be an explaination!", "I hope you can hang on for something better.", "Im happy for you.", "I lived in an apartment complex and there was a pool, so I loved swimming.", "That makes you feel safe.", "Yes, be safe my friend! I am sure you will because of your hands on experience with what you saw.", "Maybe a different facility could help?  Addiction isn't something you can deal with by yourself.", "I understand.", "Well, then it wasn't too bad.", "Wow. Sorry to hear. I dont know too much about dementia.", "Oh well, just know that everybody in the world has fallen a few times. The most important thing is you just get up and keeping walking. :)", "I'm happy for you.", "Wow. It is a great raise. Your employer should have impressed by you.", "Was he dead, or just injured badly? I wouldn't be sure what to really do either.", "It is good to have these kinds of keep sakes. Maybe the rings can even be used again in a family wedding.", "Boston is a great place to visit, makes sure you have some chowdah  :)", "Oh, what a bad pain to carry. I hope that you are happy though. Your parents will want you to always stay happy.They are in a better place now.", "Oh, yuck! They will do that, but sure don't want puppy kisses later.", "Yes, for sure! I always prefer repairs over replacement if possible.", "True!", "Oh yum!! That should grow nicely this time of year. You should definitely can all the extra tomatoes you get this year. It will be great in winter soups and stews. :)", "How long have you been an accountant?", "That is bad. What are you planning to do the rest of the day?", "Yeah, hopefully they have invented something that helps with the pain for the teething. Hopefully is is natural.", "You'll earn it all back, don't worry. For next time, though, don't listen to people who know nothing.", "Congrats! You trained for it so you deserved to win!", "I bet that makes you so proud. Perhaps he'll become a professional soccer player one day!", "Oh, well hopefully you learned some kind of lesson from this and it won't happen again.", "Oh my gosh! What where they serving? That makes me feel sick for you. I hate being decieved!", "He probably had no where to go important. He was just being rude.", "Do you take pictures professionally or just a hobby?", "sounds like its time to get out and start doing something to take your mind off from it. maybe fitness?", "I hate having debts.", "Count your lucky stars my friend! Bless you heart!", "I hope you do as well, that will be a big step towards a great career.", "That is very kind of you. There needs to be more people like you in the world!", "I love it whern", "Haha! Rollercoasters are an exhilarating experience! I love riding them at amusement parks.", "I know someone else that happened to. I wouldn't take anymore chances either.", "Enjoy the weekend as much as you can for me; I work all day today!", "Smart move honestly, better to be with a larger group than to be alone. Glad you are ok.", "I have a few friends who are way better off than I am. It makes me a bit sad about my situation.", "Yeah all you can do is encourage and support him. I hope everything works out and that he becomes rich and famous someday!", "Yeah it really is. We just slap everything on our computer or online these days. It's just not the same.", "Oh no that's awful! I hadn't realized it was carpet. As a clumsy person, that could've definitely been me in your situation so I get it.", "Children are so amazing, and life changing. I hope your sister is ready for all the challenges that awake her.", "Oh yuck!!! That is terrible! I have heard of people getting really sick from this black mold in the house. What are you going to do?", "Well that sounds terrible. It is time to burn your house down and start a new life elsewhere.", "That's a good way of seeing it I suppose.", "i can imaging the anticipation, but before you know it, you'll be on the beach", "Oh definitely! I hope your shopping day exceeds your expectations!", "No just ridiculously careless.", "Yes, I know I wouldn't mind riding the donkey or mule down there.", "It sounds like the job is a great fit for you. I really hope you get it.", "I'm so sorry to hear that. Hopefully your niece feels better now and hasn't lost too much.", "That must have been terrifying. I am glad that you are okay.", "I hope they at least gave you your money back.", "From what year?", "Good point!", "Now that I think of it, it most likely is the reason why; maybe she doesn't even think of it as a mean act and maybe means no harm by it. Regardless it is important to share how you're feeling with her.", "That's understandable, there's just no way to be sure what a stranger's intentions are.", "And you're building trust with your dog as well! It's a win-win. :)", "I'd say ignore them as best as you can. It's normal for kids to do these kind of things!", "That sounds like a great experience", "Ah. There you go so you were worried about nothing. I am glad that all was well.", "I wish I had a slow cooker. Or one of those Instant Pots everyone's raving about.", "Our past can be a great source of strength and comfort.", "That sucks. I would be disappointed also. Hopefully yall can make some time soon to get together.", "I hope you do get the job, you deserve it!", "but as time passes you will find another and be cheerful as ever.", "Did you and your dad ever play football together?", "I am so jealous of you then ha", "I hope you do get that perfect score, you deserve it after all!", "I would go atleast you would get cake", "She is . She may be able to handle it on her own. Thanks for the info", "Oh that is terrible, cashiers should have more patience.", "Maybe you could make it up to him. I'm sure he'll get over it though.", "Well, at least you gave him something. He could buy a burger at McDonald's", "Well I hope she is able to attend, if not, you know it's nothing personal!", "Oh I believe you. Typically those type of people aren't people you can reason with.", "I look forward to that when I have a kid", "That's nice. I wish my brothers did that for me.", "Ohh fun, I love the artistic nature of some. My daughter just got a tattoo in honor of me.", "That is true. We dont get a lot of snow here. I dont think anyone knows how to deal with it", "Wow, that is unfortunate, I hope you are okay financially...", "Thats not ok I have been in that situation before and have made my girlfriend a card, wrote her a poem something.", "That must have made you feel angry. I am sorry that happened to you but please forgive him.", "That sounds really deep and dramatic, I think I would like that one. You might like books like The Deep End of the Ocean also.", "Where I live, it was really nice too. There was a cool breeze and no mosquitoes out.", "That sounds creepy, I would have to start keeping protection with me just in case.", "I'm sorry to hear that. I'm sure you will find someone who feels the same about you.", "Its okay, I have good memories", "yeah,well i am not a reader but i love to play video games so much", "Did you ask him about it, or did he make a big change to high school. Sometimes a big change or just burn out can kick in.", "I know the feeling. Did a lot of people see?", "I am with you on that one", "Well I hope it isnt too expensive. Maybe it will be a smaller issue.", "I'm sure you did. Think positive!", "That's terrible. I'm so sorry. You'll never forget him.", "I am so sorry. I hope you can make friends, try to join some sort of activities to meet people.", "I see, well then I'm sorry that worked out wrong for you.", "I got you, well I hope that you get to that position at some point soon!", "And sometimes it has to do with race, it is really a sad situation.", "Damn that sucks.  Well at least you can get a fresh pair", "I know. I have a friend who has both arms covered.", "That sounds so good", "Its nice to be alone sometimes", "I hope he is okay.", "Those are pretty nice trucks ;/", "I might need to apply then!", "It happens to the best of us. At least you were able to get more since it was a buffet.", "There are still some nice people left.", "Ill keep my fingers crossed for you.", "That sounds so fun", "Oh man, I think your mother regretted that after knowing she almost hurt her family. That is quite awful to think about.", "Wow that's pretty aweseome...you must have put in a lot of hard work to earn it", "I suppose that is true to an extent, that makes sense", "i bet you will make a great bartender, maybe one of these days you will hook me up with a free drink", "That's very sweet of you.  She's going to need her friends to help her through this!", "That is absolutely amazing! Lucky you", "I remember my dad watching football so much as a kid. I used to get so bored.", "I am sorry, I would cuss too if it happened to me", "It sounds like you and your father got along well, and that isn't always the case in families. I'm happy to hear that.", "You did the right thing. I wouldn't have been able to stop thinking about it.", "Ah, so you are now a loner, you should try to make friends.", "yeah I got to a few places like that", "That will be fun.", "I'm glad you worked it out!", "That's great. It sound like it's really working out for you.", "That is worse. I would have been so jealous and annoyed.", "Maybe you can get a tutor this time.", "You can if you want", "I hope your date goes well!  Stay optimistic and positive!", "Duh! You better, I do hope you have a whale of a time. I would be elated.", "That was probably a good idea", "I can understand that. But its still really funny. My husband is the one to get more embarrassed over things like that.", "I hope I can be a mom someday!", "Well I hope it works out for you!", "Everyone needs close friends to talk to and hangout with.", "You should put a camera there. You can see it from your phone.", "Good for you. I hope you get a good start.", "Aweomse, always great to see people forming new relationships.", "Did you hurt yourself?", "Aww I'm sorry you didn't like it. Roller coasters can be pretty scary, even for people like me who enjoy them.", "Yeah - the first time I went with friends, I won 100 bucks but ended up giving it back to the casino.  I told myself that if I won money like that again, I'd just stop and take the money home.  It works out well!", "Yeah that is really not ok", "Well that is great. I think people get upset over other people actions when it comes to facebook.", "Those are \\big right?", "I heard that was going around.", "I'd be pretty upset, too.  Did anyone give a reason why your coworker was chosen over you?", "Oh!  I didn't know people hunted them!  What is used to hunt them?  Shotguns?", "Awesome. I'm sure you'll do well then.", "Make sure you take lots of pictures and prepare for the weather.", "I imagine,  I am easily scared with these kind of movies, so I don't watch them much.", "Nice, you're never too old to go trick or treating haha", "Thats too bad. What do you do now?", "Great!  A new look can certainly help feel refreshed, at leas it does it for me.", "I hope you have a great time!", "Yes, i have that one friend and you don't want to give up on him. I hope he gets it together soon", "That's great. Do they offer dental and vision", "I can just imagine, make sure you take lots of pictures and dress for the weather. It will be hot.", "You are lucky to have a nice dad.", "Oh, well I hope it works out well for you!", "I hope all your family was doing well.", "Did you look into the situation further? Did you call your phone company and see what they had to say about it?", "No, it certainly isn't! Hopefully, she'll keep loving it and will love learning for the rest of her life. Think what a gift that must be!", "Yes, as a wife and mother, I know I usually look to my husband for guidance and strength in situations like that!", "That's the beauty of it, I feel motivated now so I need to keep an eye out on my local job market.", "It can be infuriating.  For example, over a 3 year period in my own state, there was about ~20 million dollars worth of food stamps spent in major vacation hot spots (florida, hawaii, california, virgin islands)", "Or it could be you and a dope house party", "You're welcome! you have your whole life ahead of you, you are a star.", "I hope they don't do it on purpose to annoy you!", "I hate that people do things like that.", "Did you win anything?", "Same here how old is your little bro?", "I get that, I will pray for her, best of luck friend", "True, if one is not happy about something the best thing is to switch things up.", "Do you have any other pets", "I would maybe hit him or get revenge at least", "What will you get her?", "Ok, sorry I didn't know.  I hope the play better next time!", "I think bad reviews are important though. A lot of people use those to determine where they go for service. You may save someone else the trouble you have.", "It will be good to catch up with them!  Family is all that matters.", "Sweet. I hope to meet you on the battlefield someday!", "That sounds like lots of fun!", "I want to some day.", "That is awesome, I am glad you have that type of relationship!", "I hope you enjoy your card very much!", "Well, it has been for three years so that's a great sign!", "Ew that's gross! Can't you get sick from partially cooked chicken?", "Well I hope for you that one day you can. Maybe retirement! Man, that would be amazing.", "If all people do is pray, then certainly nothing will change. It's time to start acting instead of wishing for things to change if we want to our children and grandchildren to see a future.", "Well I would go on the date then buy the kid a big present.", "it is. just wait until he says dada you will melt lol", "Oh I've seen that, it is not too bad! I had fun watching it.", "I thought they were so much better that nsync too lol", "no need to go that far, just make sure your friend has not seen the movie before and go out and enjoy it.", "that is true, that is lame though", "That's good to hear.", "You must be proud of her. That is great.", "Ouch! I hope he was okay!", "That's no good. What are you going to do?", "Yes I know what you mean,  That has happened to me too.", "THe nostalgia must have been so good!", "Or even do both! Is your daughter in school?", "I hope you do, too. I will definitely throw in a prayer or two that you do!", "Nice. I love finding old stuff from my childhood.", "Man.. I'm glad you're not my roommate.", "Dang, it must have been embarrassing", "My youngests are 3 and 4 now. Those days are gone", "That is true,  but you will meet new people and learn a lot!", "How cool! Congrats again on your new addition, I'll keep you in my thoughts and pray you get some sleep in the next 12 months haha", "That is good positive reinforcement!  Congrats to your kid!", "Okay, I understand. I am thinking of watching it.", "That sounds awful!", "Well I wish you the best of luck.  If you're hardworking then you'll make it", "I have been in the past.  Right now I'm part time with some work at home/stuff.  So yeah I do remember liking not having a boss the most!", "That's right, you do. I have a hard time doing that myself and should realize I deserve it as well too.", "That's good.  It could have been a lot worse!", "How old is your kid", "Gotcha.  I make sure to call my mom at least twice a week, I'm 26 and I've got my own apartment as well", "So far so good, just trying to stay cool. Good conversations are helping.", "Oh yes, you can relax a bit and pay some bills.", "I know that feeling. Did you treat yourself after winning?", "People hate on Brady cuz he's been gold since day 1.  But the Eagles came ready on defense that's for sure", "I do, I have been trying to bulkup, I am 6'4 190 and need some more on my frame", "Hopefully he got the point and wont ask again.", "We are living in a cruel world, I am just happy that you are fine.", "Ahhh! Well at least you found out it was just user error and not that he was actually better than you!", "If they don't, that's their loss. My family are so important to me - I love them dearly. The same goes for my close friends. Don't listen to other people - they're the ones missing out!", "I hope you guys have fun", "I know one has to earn trust.", "wow, that is huge, they must have abosrbed kids from another duck or something", "I bet you were embarassed", "Now you're talking. That would be nice ;)", "I bet it is, i am afraid of water, I cannot swim so i know for a fact I would not be trying that. I hope you have fun.", "Just hold on a little longer!  You will feel better when he gets back!", "I am sure they will have a great time", "So you really surprised yourself. I guess you studied hard.", "Just keep a budget and stay strict. It will gradually get better.", "I like animated movies. I have lots of kids lol", "Nice I'm in TX and my fam's in MN.  I try to visit them at least once a year", "Amazing, you must feel really proud!", "Good luck! I am sure it will be fine.", "It is wonderful that you have family that can help.  Are you going to be OK going forward?", "That cat will love you forever!", "Hahaha you are going to scream, I hope you dont puke. It should be fun though.", "That is good to hear. I hope he lives a good life.", "I am sorry about it, did she move close by or to another town?", "That sounds grand :) it's a deal I am rooting for you.", "Wow that must have been a while back...do you still keep in touch with these friends", "I hope you find out soon.", "Oh no.  Poor thing!  Hope you are hanging in there.", "Yes, curling up in bed with those things can relax you like nothing else!", "I hope everything goes great and you get your new home!", "He really is a talented player, I must admit.", "You must have been proud.  But she wouldn't be there if you didn't persistently push her to do her best", "Yeah, I know exactly what you mean.", "I think they would lie sooner if they could.  My kid told me flat out that her brother did something when it was impossible that he could've so I knew instantly.  Its humorous while they're young watching them get into such a deep hole.", "I know that is hard, but it's alright if you do it for the right reasons.  You all will be able to laugh about it when it's all over.  Have fun!", "That's pretty interesting. Well, I hope you get that all sorted out!", "I completely understand. Your parents sound like great people.", "Well you can start slowly, I'm sure you will find your motivation again", "Thats a neat way to decide on a name. We picked our kids names months in advance. Luckily their names fit them well.", "Oh no haha. I'm guessing you at least had to be polite and pretend like you didn't want to puke?", "Reminds me of that Eddie Murphy movie!", "Or he's looking for his soulmate", "It's the best,  but it is hard to give up the delicious fried meats, though.", "I bet you and your date were shaken up!", "I am so sorry that happened to you!", "I'm sorry.  Make sure to reach out to her and tell her how you feel.  If she's a good friend, she'll understand and make an effort to make time for you but don't let it make you bitter.", "That is so awful.  I imagine you won't feel safe again until you get the alarm.  You can also get a big dog to help you keep safe.", "It seems your daughter may over exaggerate things a little bit.", "Well maybe you can tell your friend and ask him/her to forgive you.", "Sounds like a great plan. Good luck!", "Keep it up. Failure is for dweebs.", "That is great that your wife took such great care of you!   I hope you are now feeling completely recovered.", "I can understand your feelings; but I suspect you made the right decision.  Maybe it is something you can talk with your friend about.  A good friend will understand.", "You should look for camera in the area, they could help you catch the perp.", "That is great.  I wish you the best of luck!", "What kind of tricks did he do", "It's great that you're so positive about life.", "Oh, sounds very romantic! Have fun my friend!", "Well if you do decide to go through with it, I wish you the best and quick healing!", "That's really nice! I hope you recover really quick!", "I'm sure you'll do well.", "Oh yes don't forget the sun block. Very important! Well I hope you all have fun out there! I am jealous!", "Lesson learned, that's for sure", "Better not go on any planes!", "Yea...sometimes gym managers tend not to be there which is a pain. I hope it works out for you, though!", "Yes I believe it is better.  I hope your friend understand.", "Well, that sounds admirable.  Focusing on making money so you can be independent.", "haha oh man did the owner get mad...or did he just laugh it off", "Can fat really turn into muscles? Asking for myself? lol", "I'm more of a Honda guy tbh.  My Civic lasted me a 21hr nonstop drive from MN to South TX and she still runs good as new", "That is true!  way to look at the bright side!", "That is the important thing,  I always keep reminding myself to focus while driving too.", "Someone needs to invent a time machine!", "it's not as hard as i thought it would be. certainly helps with staying within a certain amount of calories per daay.", "Hey, don't worry about what other people think! As long as you have a safe roof over your head and your family is happy, that's all that matters!", "That is definitely scary.  I don't understand why people want to steal from others.  Get a dang job!", "I'm sure you are going to do great.  I really hope you do get a better paying job as a result.  Good luck!", "Sorry you missed the concert. That is a bummer! But it came with some perks I guess. You met a girl!", "Yes I am sure that have make you or will make you in the future a wonderful parent too!", "Me too! I'm not sure what you might be going through but do consider making sure youre eating a good amount of fruits and veggies. Herbs too, they're all healing and helpful to the body.", "So much winning, but with coffee it never gets old", "That must've been funny", "Well that's good, at least he didn't do it on purpose. Otherwise I would have found a way to get back at him. Maybe laxatives to make him REALLY go!", "I can imagine. Now you have to get planning the wedding. Should be fun", "Maybe you should talk with him and let him know how serious of an issue it is to you.", "You did the right thing. You should always stay ready for a disaster.", "Nice, I bet you can't wait to graduate.", "Yes, the US takes advantage of the need for education. I hope you find a job you love, and don't forget that they have lots of payment options.", "Are you two still going out?", "Wow.... I certainly hope so.", "Ah, so he had ulterior motives and wanted the chores done! Just kidding. Glad you're feeling better.", "That is so great! Its good to know that there are still good people in this world", "Oh I see. Are you far from home?", "Well, you did say it was one you really wanted. How nice of him to do that for you.", "That would be the best birthday present ever! I know he'll make every effort possible to be with you.", "They have all kinds of treatments for cancer now. He should have a fighting chance.", "Oh that is a nice surprise. I bet you caught up with each other.", "Who knows, that's a waste of a good sandwich though!", "I understand. Hopefully he fixes it for you.", "Did they take anything valuable?", "Well that's understandable. Hope you had a great party afterwards!", "It would make me feel amazing to see their face!", "It is paying off. That is such a fun age.", "Hopefully you have insurance?", "I hope things look better. My friend dealt with a similar issue", "What university or college?", "Definitely. It will probably be tougher on you than him. Here's to a wonderful first day of preschool for both of you!", "That must be so difficult. I hope all turns out well.", "You must be very proud. Cant wait to see what he does next.", "I have never had that happen to me", "Good, I bet you were mad. At least they made it right though.", "You must find joy in your life - something you are passionate about", "Hope everything goes as planned!", "I feel so sorry for you. I love my pets too.", "Oh sounds nice. Hopefully he doesn't have any accidents in it.", "that sounds amazing! check out the french quarter while you are there.", "That is awesome. I love all the food and time off.", "That is great that you are there to help him out!", "gross, i don't blame you, public restrooms are always disgusting", "That will be nice to have some time to catch up. Have fun!", "That's debatable!", "That's great. You have quite the household it seems!", "I hope not. I have a feeling things will get better", "Good, I would have too!", "Good luck! don't be nervous. I'm sure you'll knock it out of the park!", "I'm so sorry. My sister was in the very same situation as you and I can tell you, she made it through and her daughter is 9 now.  She kept taking a day at a time and working hard and went back to school to become a nurse. You can do it to. Find some true friends who will support you no matter what.", "Just have faith, I am sure it will all turn out!", "I love the guitar, too! That's marvelous", "How old was your friend?", "Ohhh,  so how is she now?", "It's already yours, hopefully! If not, that means there's something out there better for you.:)", "Oh thank goodness! I hate hearing people losing their pets.", "I hope you have a splendid time! That might be great", "That is a unique name, I have 3 sons myself.", "Mine did that, too. We had to replace the motion sensor.", "that's great! my kids played baseball", "Omg! That really is the best birthday present ever!", "Were you really close to her?", "I bet your employer still knows how much you have put in", "I am glad you are getting to see them!", "That is awesome! My sister is a CNA now but in school to become a nurse. Have you worked in any other settings as a nurse?", "Welcome, and yeah I always disliked mowing the lawn!", "I'm glad you have a great family!", "Wow that is a long move!", "Yes there are. Can't trust anyone these days.", "Around town? or what?", "I think I heard about them in the news.", "It really is. Getting older is not fun.", "I agree. I avoid going to stores during busy times because I just cant handle being around so many people.", "Lol i am sorry about that! hopefully you can get it out", "Right? Get out of the way!", "Hmmm... Not as interesting", "Well I'm glad to hear you have a clean bill of health!", "Yeah, as long as you have a car you are better than most people", "Well hopefully something else will come up for you!", "That is so exciting.. enjoy this time with him.", "Yeah, I enjoy cooking but it can be so time consuming.", "Maybe you should cut his brakes", "Oh my goodness!  That is so awesome.  I would love to be able to do something like that.", "I didnt know that. I guess not.", "what happened afterwards", "Oh my! That is horrible!", "That is the truth, no shame in his game.", "That is awesome, good luck", "I don't blame you! Get them all!", "Well I wish both of you years of happiness together!", "It happens, I'm sure they don't blame you!", "I wonder if there is anything you can do about that.", "Man there are some crappy people in the world", "Did they take anything important?", "I enjoy fried rice! I hope she wasn't too upset.", "Haha yeah I guess you can't really return it at that point", "That sounds fun! have you been looking at the old baby pictures?", "Me either. It breaks my heart.", "I am so glad to hearit. What's going right in your life?", "Congrats! Are you still pregnant?", "Awesome, I hope you have a great time at the concert.", "Is the interview soon? Good luck.", "That's awesome, glad he's able to hand it down to the next generation", "Were you in the house?", "That is what is most important!", "Right, it's hard to imagine there was a time before you when you're little", "I bet! Good bonding time. How old is your son?", "If you put forth the effort im sure you will", "Yes you will! That's a great attitude", "Wow that's even funnier... But even more unfortunate", "That is rough. I am glad you made it through.", "Good luck! I'm sure you'll ace it!", "Right, taste good too", "I wish my company would allow me to do that.", "That is good, they are hard to find", "She must be a party animal.", "sheesh what a bummer!", "It sounds like you had a good time though.", "Wow, I got a ticket the other day going 70 in a 55. I was late for work", "I'm sure it'll go swimmingly", "Who is your team.", "That is good, i hope it stays that way", "I agree! They look cool and are fun to play in the mud with", "Macho man lol", "I see, yeah sometimes you just gotta lead by example", "Exactly, it doesnt happen very often", "I like soccer", "oh then that makes sense. good thing they were willing to help", "Man. Thats very interesting. Were you at all surprised to have twins then?", "Nice, hope it goes well", "Its been a while since I've seen someone drunk", "I would be a little spooked out by being alone", "Yeah they are, but so good", "I hope you get it!  When will you find out?", "Little bugger, maybe next time", "I watched parts of it too. I didnt think it was that great either.", "Oh that is really neat! i hope they like it", "Sometimes you got to setp in and say something though when you know something is not right.", "Lol that happens to the best of us, dont feel bad", "That is still not bad!", "Wow!  That seems worth it!!!!  Wish it had happened to me! ha ha.  Hope you're healthy still and congratulations!", "Oh ok that is very nice of you", "That sounds pretty awful. no thanks.", "Lol. I am guilty of hiding a couple of snacks for myself at times, nothing wrong with that", "Yeah I would have been mad too. If he needed something he should have at least asked. Stealing is never okay.", "That is insane, i hope everything works out!", "This just happened?  Oh boy!  maybe you can replace it before she gets up.", "Make sure the consultant doesn't try to rip you off either haha.", "It is a difficult subject no doubt", "That's good news. I bet it was fun!", "Go for it! You'll only regret the pizzas you don't eat!", "True, driving takes more focus than a lot of people can handle", "don't worry", "You should make it up to that person.", "I'd probably have done the exact same thing - then called for my husband or one of my daughters to kill it!!", "I'm so sorry!  I know how hard it is to lose a pet!  I hope you are not sad for too long.  It sounds like you did everything you could to give it a great life.", "And they're all you got in the end!", "I dont blame you, i would have been terrified", "That must be a cool bar to let pets in.", "Glad I could help.", "I am so sorry for the loss. Good friends are so hard to come by", "That's awesome, hope he goes far", "Haha thats a good name. Were you able to see it vividly?", "Oh I hope you punched him back.", "I bet that was embarrassing. Was you drunk?", "That is terrible", "i miss them as well", "Oh they're in your bubble. that stinks, some people are weird like that, no bounderies.", "I can appreciate why they'd say that. They just want you to feel better. But it's all about to how you're feeling. You'll know in your gut when to get another pet, if you ever want to get another one. It's important to take the time to reflect on your lost relationship.", "Right, that's something you can at least have full control over. Your own humble abode.", "I'm so sorry to hear that. Some people are just cruel to others that are not within their social circle.", "I know right. Some people are too lazy.", "Thank you! I hope to feel that content someday!", "That's quite the mix! What's his name?", "I suppose so. I've never gravitated towards them. They seem like they only have one personality, and they're either nice or mean, and never warm up to you over time. So, I was a little wary of that.", "That is awesome!  What kind of boats do you make?", "For real? haha good job!", "i agree totally, it takes a strong person to admit they are like that", "Oh no. That is no good! It is hard to sit back and watch someone have a drug problem", "You are a good friend though. I wish i had more friends like you.", "Better to rest so you can do everything you want tomorrow!", "That is how I feel about it. I love my country.", "I was joking. I havent a curfew since I was 17. Im an only child so wouldnt know much about favorites.", "That is not ok I would make go to a higher up", "I bet that is a lot of work!  Do you already teach?", "Right! It's like some kind of spiritual bond I think. It's a wonderful love to have!", "Right, change is often difficuly", "Yeah i know i dont get why people are that way", "I really hope you get it. Just stay confident.", "Holy moly ravioli. 27 million? You are rolling in the money.", "That is terrible, is there someone above him you can go to?", "No, I am not a big fan. Which team do you like?", "I am now. Had to get stitched up.", "Oh that stinks. I bet you were pretty mad?", "Was it at least Budweiser?", "Did they take your television?", "Sometimes life does have away with getting away from us", "Cherish those moments", "Good taste in candy! I love Reeses cups and Hershey bars. Did you eat any of those?", "What the heck is there?", "I say go for it", "I see, I hope it goes well for you!", "Yeah it always foes in the end", "I am so sorry to hear that!", "Maybe he should take up knitting--or something else that would be a bit more quiet.", "Ah that is disgusting!", "Dang that is pretty scary though.", "Well if you have never gotten blind drunk and strip naked, you haven't lived.", "Wow that sounds like fun.I love canoeing!", "Hope everything works out for you!", "That's amazing, keep up the good work!", "Oh, that is rude, did you pay him back?", "Sometimes compromises have to be made. But I have to say, I'm impressed that you were that self-aware about the entire process, especially as a somewhat new adult. Good for you for considering all the options and making the choice you felt was best. You sound like you'll be successful after college, especially because of how hard-working you are.", "I completely understand that. Its a good quality to have and is actually healthier in the long run if you keep your surroundings clean.", "Good thinking.  Sounds like you should get yourself a new house", "I completely agree. Unfortunately we also have to clean up the mess made by our parent generation.. you know like climate change exists!", "Heh. Thats really cool. I need to take self defense classes.", "Dang are you scared at all? As far as doing it yourself?", "I hope it tasted good!", "Probably from the crazy weather change. I hope they figure out what is causing the cough", "I am sure he will be fine", "That is a good thing ha", "It seems that a decent one is several hundred dollars.  I just don't have that kind of money.", "I know quite a few people that live their lives that way. I can see some of the reasons why a person would think that -- but it's still difficult when it comes to the health of someone you love.", "I see, dont worry though. Nowadays everyone finds an excuse to grab their pitchfork and point it at someone.", "What ended up being the problem ?", "Hell yea you sound like a genuine guy/girl. You know what is important, you will do fine.", "I see. Well, what's most important is your reaction and feelings around the situation, and what you plan to do about it. The only one that can affect the outcome is you. It's disappointing to deal with your uncle's negativity, but you can't let it distract you from moving in a positive direction.", "I hope they do too! I'm happy for you", "Right, it's amazing how one thing can bring back so many memories", "That is a really great thing to hear. I hope you can find some way to pay back his kindness.", "yeah im not sure i could every take that job", "Oh, so you got involved? Were you trying to protect the kid? If so, I can understand that, and that's noble. Hopefully nothing too negative came from the situation.", "That's good, at least he learned from that. I hope you guys are going strong now!", "Lol. Sometimes we got to do what we gotta do", "Well dang that is awesome man, hopefully you can save up for your own lambo.", "Well that's great of her, we've all done stuff.", "At least they asked you, that's good. It will pass in no time and you'll be hanging soon I'm sure,", "It is, glad you could figure out that she's not right to have in your life", "Ahh, that's too bad. Just make sure to take responsibility and be very sorry for your actions, maybe it won't be so bad.", "I am sorry to hear that, well maybe when you retire!", "Did you have a lot of work done?", "That sounds good!", "Yes and hopefully no one was hurt.", "Haha I wouldn't either if I had a Porsche....sounds like you need some kind of bomb shelter emergency parking", "I am glad for you then", "Haha no worries. I though how could a couch could be scary... Are you OK? did you go to the doctor?", "Luckily it is in the past, and I am sure no one remembers it!", "I'm happy he's able to support his family through his work. I hope he enjoys it!", "Yeah, I would have done the some.  Hopefully that never happens to you again.", "Hahaha, me too, it's such a time sink. This week when it was down for a couple hours I really felt like I had nothing else to browse.", "Yikes! My old Ford Focus had a similar issue. It turned out to be really bad alignment and ended up putting a hole in our front tire.", "Oh how cool!  Well good luck my friend!!! What do you want to study?", "That's so lame, you should maybe tell your boss about it though.", "Is the kid ok?  He won't have his license for a few more years probably now.", "Thats alright. As long as you two are happy with each other, thats the most important thing!", "Seems like you have a trustworthy friend for life! I hope you cherish this friendship.", "Just remember, it is probably a female mosquito.  They are the ones interested in your blood.  Not the males.", "Good job for realizing that because such people are a bad influence. Join some outdoor or interest clubs and you might just find new friends.", "Yea i would be too! That is a horrible person.", "Aww thank you, means a lot!", "Right, but deep down I'm sure you know that you don't need a relationship to feel content!", "Wow, that is a wonderful keepsake from him. I bet you really cherish it.", "What did you have to eat ?", "I'm sorry! Take the time to grieve and be there for your friend.", "I saw it, and it was a good  movie, i dont usually watch marvel films", "You should try engaging in a hobby to divert your mind, and when you're ready, adopt a puppy from your local shelter.", "I bet... that's a lot of weekends and late evenings practicing and honing your skills. I'm sure it's a lot of positive intangibles developed that you will reap the awards from later on in life.", "I agree, now you will financially and physically secure. All the stress of not having insurance is far too much given our healthcare costs.", "Might be time to just stop letting him use your stuff, unfortunately.", "That is for sure! Someone must really like you!", "I am sure it is. Just need to give him time and support right now.", "Math was always my least favorite. Are you British?", "That's a bit much of him to dodge his country when they needed him don't you think?", "That should motivate him to keep up the good work!", "I understand", "Hope you're enjoying it!", "That's really good then. I'm sure it will help you financially", "I hope it all went well for you.", "I've played Monopoly before, of course. I wonder why that's the game everyone's played during their childhood... But yeah, Risk I've never played, dunno why. Maybe you should grab one and get some friends or family involved, for old time's sake.", "That is great well know you know what not to do on a plane lol", "Is this recent. Do you know why?", "oh i cot ya. i am glad you have your stuff.", "I live right by that one!", "Oh I see, that is to be expected. At least you still have the gear!", "Thats great! Glad it worked out for you and your dog was safe! I hear so many bad stories about people loosing pets.", "OK now I'm curious...what the hell did you do", "I am glad that it is finally paying off! Keep it up because independence is the sweetest thing.", "I hope everything works out for you", "I am so sorry for your loss, within time you will heal. Just try to cherish the memories that you was left with, Think about all the good times", "The things they do make no sense.  Kid logic!", "It's Ok. Everyone can chang ein life. Do you drink too much?", "I see, if you're in college, try talking to your Resident Advisor about it.", "You could get a nice dinner with that. Have fun.", "I hope it will be ok. Were you late for your work?", "Hope everything works out for you!", "I get that, but all seasons are good, you miss the ones that it is not", "No, I'm sure I'm a bit older than you.", "I get that, too bad we cannot refund movies", "He must be for his children to seem him as an inspiration!", "Man, i am so sorry, i could not imagine.", "I think you should keep them instead of throwing them away.", "I hope it wasn't too painful for him and he disinfected and bandaged that wound up.", "That's weird. I am happy you have your possesions.", "I bet she is! I am so glad you get to see her. Mom's are awesome!", "That's horrible, i am sorry!", "I am glad to hear that.  I hope it keeps staying that way", "Yup, but what I don't like about that age is having to stay up all night!", "Awe. Ya it doesn't take much to get attached to something that you are nursing back to health", "That is so cool! We adopted a cat from a shelter and he is the best cat!", "Ewww. Adults should know better than that. I think I would have been grossed out", "Memories are the most precious thing we can have in life I think.", "That's great that you two reconnected like it! I'm happy for you.", "It is ok. Most spider are not dangerous. What is it a big one?", "On no. Was this at a public place?", "Dang that is unfortunate!", "Dang.  I bet you're gonna have some good times together!", "Oh gosh, i think it was just a tree falling i bet.", "Definitely, it's good to work for a company that does that too", "You'll be fine, next time just look and see how clean their bathrooms are, it gives you a good idea how their kitchens are!", "Sounds like heaven! I am also looking forward to them too.", "The LSAT is no joke. He must have studied very hard.", "Those are so tasty, are you excited?", "You will do great, just stay confident!", "Age doesn't amtter, show him you are ready.", "It's okay, you got out fine this time!", "Oh yeah, that really is a waste of time", "Thats good.  Stay confident and let things happen naturally!", "Good to hear, glad you guys are happy!", "I'm sorry to hear that! haha guess he's not invited next time!", "Our imperfections help us stay unique! Do worry yourself with that, there are so many other things that can get us down and worry us! Just keep being awesome!", "Well, it's good to have you join the workforce in society. You seem like a positive person who can contribute well. Hopefully you find a passion that utilizes your hard-earned degree.", "Yes, he needs a firm hand to lead the way out of this kind of behaviours. You need to step up and introduce some strict schedules so he won't have time to do anything bad.", "Yeah, gotta be careful one day you might hurt yourself pretty bad", "Dang, that must look great!", "That is great congrat!", "Gotcha..hope that didn't ruin your whole day", "Nice, I never understood why that's embarassing haha", "Oh wow I'm sorry! That's not cool, they would be hurt if people were laughing at them", "That's got to be frustrating. Have you thought of maybe working at the same place?", "That is horrible! I bet a little part of you was scared", "It sounds like it!", "I have a few. It really does help when times are not so great.", "Now you can carry on that tradition.", "Same here and next thing you know it's a blizzard.", "Wow! What a great surprise! You should thank the person that planned it!", "I am happy for you!", "I see, think of it as having a conversation with a friend. It will make it easier!", "They are, but if you save up a little at a time, it won't be that bad!", "So cute! Take a lot of photos so he'll be able to see them in the future!", "I'm sure you will! Maybe start with a simple roll like the california roll or ask the waitress for recomendations.", "Lol. Oh. Coasters are fun. Very exciting!", "Well good.  Hopefully you got your food re-made though.", "Oh OK, hopefully you have some friends you can bring over and share your traditions.", "Absolutely. I'm the kind of person that can be around for people a little bit, but get drained by them. I think that's getting more and more common for others. Could you tell me what kind of animals you have real quick!", "I hope they both keep the love for reading and writing!", "Oh great! That's sooner than in my company.  I know you'll get one. Just keep working hard and good luck!", "Maybe you'll never see her again!", "Yes, and you will succeed eventually.", "I did that myself, and I can tell you it was well worth it.  I am much happier now than I ever was.  I wish you very good luck on whatever you decide to do!", "Oh no. Thats terrible.", "I hope your insurance does too! Just take care of youself and I hope you feel better soon!", "Well, luckily Google is so helpful these days. There's tons of templates out there. It's kind of annoying to deal with, especially because it's being motivated by your company possibly disappearing.. but it won't take long at all to craft a good one, especially because oftentimes the shorter they are, the better", "That is great.", "It is scary to think about, I hope for the best!", "that is a cool job", "Sounds like a great trip. I hope you guys have a fun time.", "Awww! Congratulations! I hope everything goes smoothly.", "It's just a way to calm the body and the mind.  It is SO easy to fall into the trap of anxiety.  But falling there doesn't accomplish a thing.  Take a breath, focus on one small success, then move to the next.", "Sometimes jealousy can become us. But most times it does not pay to be that way, cause 9 times out of 10 those kind of people is just living off credit so technically it is not something they own out right", "I see, hope she is able to understand!", "That sounds interesting, when do you learn if you got in?", "Way to go! That is a great accomplishment!", "Aww that's great! I have two dogs, they become part of the family! Enjoy your new house :)", "Well that is a good reason. You are blessed.", "Sell the house!", "Hope you're all right!", "That is great.", "Ahh yes, that's very nice too, good for her! You guys have a happy marriage.", "I can relate, I get red face when ever I have to come infront of the class to present.", "Just one ticket, that sounds lonely for him.", "California is fun to visit as well! Glad you all had fun.", "yeah my mom did that for me a few years back", "Well it's not a huge deal in the grand scheme of the universe! I am sure it will be fine.", "Great. It is always good to see your family. Is it very far?", "Wow. That is really horrible. I am so sorry that happened to you.", "That's the spirit. It's good that you don't take yourself too seriously. Heck, my roommate walked in on me doing some self-pleasure just yesterday.. I used to think that was my worst nightmare, but in the moment I just did my best to laugh it off so we could move forward faster", "Mine hadn't been replaced in 6 years, I found that out after the fact.", "Confidence is key, it's honestly what upper management looks for not necessarily technical skills right off the bat...just like Leo DiCaprio in Catch Me if You Can haha", "Yes, they should really learn to concentrate on their own life instead of complaining about other people.", "That would have scared me. At least it wasnt an intruder.", "yeah same but it can be fun", "Me too, that would be terrible.", "If you need to you can always take it again. Good luck!", "Omg that is so scary, I am so sorry to hear that."]
