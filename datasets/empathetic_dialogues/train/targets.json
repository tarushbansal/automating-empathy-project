If it occurs a lot more I suggest you saying something about it, better to know the truth than dwell on it everytime.", "Yea, recently I have been trying to decide whether or not I want to mute my girlfriend on social media or not, like not block her, just mute her.  Because it bothers me how she acts single on social media, and it confuses me as to whether she wants to be with me, or is just trying to live a different personality online.  Because she talks to me and is all lovey-dovey, then gets on social media and talks like \"I don't need anyone\" and talks about how hot guys are.  And it leaves me so stuck and with the worst anxiety.", "Was your history test hard even after all the studying?", "That's good, did you end up passing then?", "We met yesterday at this restaurant and just had some good conversation, ate some food, and caught up with each other's lives.", "Some garlic bread, some hot wings, and a few slices of pizza.", "Oh you were? I really am not a huge sports fan, so what was so big about this?", "Never once? Damn, no wonder you were so shocked by it!", "Yes, when does the season start?", "That's exciting, who's your favorite team?", "Do you regret it now that you are?", "Why are you worried still?", "oh no. How long has she been gone.", "I hope not. My friends cat left for two weeks once. she came back hungry, but she was fine.", "well I hope your cat returns safely.", "you too", "Can you do any work to it. I know there are a lot ideas on pinterest to perk up a place.", "Keep on the lookout and talk to realtors. They usually hear of good places first", "Beforehand I was really nervous that I was gonna mess it up and make things awkward. Contrary to that it really wasn't too bad!", "This Italian restaurant and an escape room too.", "I worry about that too occasionally, but I just push it to the back of my mind like usual.", "I'm sure it won't be, most people die of old age around their friends and family in a peaceful way so just hope for that.", "I am, I like the Oilers, who's your favorite team?", "Nice, I hope they do well this season.", "Oh, all kids are a little iffy, I think. Are you a teacher or do you mean your own children?", "Teenagers are awful! I am really looking forward to my daughter becoming a teenager....not.", "My mom put \"the curse\" on me. She said she hopes my daughter acted 10 times worse than I did. If that's the case, I need to start saving for boarding school, because I was awful!", "Good luck!", "So is it working now? I need atransmission for an old volvo. I'm saving for a new car instead.", "Makes sense. I don't want any more bills until my kids are in school. Daycare is very expensive.", "of course the 13 year old hates to babysit. I can't wait until she moves out. jk", "This was the most fun chat Ive had today. Enjoy yur day!", "What is HELLP? I'm sorry you and your baby had to go through that.", "That's terrible. There are so many things to be afraid of when you're pregnant!", "I'm saving for a new one. I didn't even have it a year. ", "Nope. I bought it cash from obviously a snake oil salesman.", "Why are you alone so much in the summer?", "Do you have friends around? Go to a bar and meet some friends!", "Was it as you remembered it?", "That is amazing that it was not torn down or remodeled.  They seem to throw way too many buildings away these days.", "I know that feeling too, at least somewhat. Seems like clear favoritism to me, but maybe I'm wrong.", "That type of stuff always makes me so angry, since it's so clearly favoritism and hypocrisy and they just don't care one bit.", "I like football, who are you talking about? what team?", "Oh i see! are you excited with him? do you think they can go for the super bowl?", "I know that feeling!  Are you involved in any political or activists groups?", "Me neither.  But I agree with your sentiment - it is a great place to live and be a part of!", "Yes. I do not have any kids myself.", "Yes. Grandkids would be fun.", "oh no. Did you get rid of the evidence?", "who's cookies were they?", "I do now. I passed all of my classes last semester, so I think I;m back on track.", "University of Memphis", "Interviews can be nerve wrecking.", "I think if you stay calm you'll do fine.", "Yikes, that must of been a bit scary. How did it go?", "That's something at least. I hope they catch him.", "Yeah, I have a friend who has gone through the same situation. She just wants whats best best for her kids. I hope things get better for you.", "It shouldn't matter what you look like, but why would you think you are fat?", "It doesn't mean you are fat or overweight. Everyone is different.", "I watch it sometimes, It can be a little slow moving for my taste.", "Are you from New York area. I'm a little farther south, but I do like them for sure. ", "It can be an inconvenience and it only paid 12 dollars a day. So that was bad.", "really bad.", "Yes, so are you having nice weather,or is it too dry and need some rain?", "I see. Well, maybe the weather is calling for some in the near future? I like sunshine, but know we need some rain too, hope you get some soon.", "Not this time. But it did a little bit in 2009. and the mud and mess was unbelievably hard to clean up. ", "You get very stressed out , like post traumatic stress disorder when it starts raining lol", "No! That's the worst part. I can understand if someone left a note to say sorry. But no :(", "Thank you, I really appreciate that. Makes the situation a little more bearable. ", "Oh no, that really sucks. That's awful that she wanted to end things, especially since you were really into her. I am sorry.", "That's really odd, and unfortunate. Thankfully there are many more girls that would match you better :) Don't lose hope!", "We went to Disney world with some friends who had never been before.  We are passholders so we have been several times, but it was fun getting to see it throught the eyes of someone who had never been before.", "We had a great time!  We both have small kids so they loved playing together, and it was nice to get to help show our friends the ropes and all the 'secrets' lol", "It is for me.  I am very type A, and getting to plan and coordinate everything is right up my alley!", "Yes, it was my nephew's birthday party pizza. And I promised him I would make his favorite pepperoni pizza! ", "We had to order from a fast food chain! It wasn't bad, but fair to say, my nephew was disappointed in me.", "It left in the oven and was distracted by my boss", "Yes airplanes make me feel queasy too. What do you do to cope with it?", "I am sorry to hear that. Flying is never easy, especially when you feel that stressed", "Who is she?", "That is bad. Did you bought her a good present so she can forget about it?", "That does sound scary! Were you okay?", "Understandable, it must have been very unexpected!", "That can be a fun time, it is nice to watch kids sometimes", "I love playing video games, I am sure he really enjoyed that, even I would have!", "Nice, I am glad to hear about that ", "How old is he?", "Wow, that's terrible. Why would he do that to you?", "I'm sorry you're having to go through that, I hope you're able to sell the home for a better price.", "That's just terrible. Some people really are ungrateful.", "Well, hopefully he'll learn to be a better person someday, or eventually his actions will come back to haunt him.", "I know that feel, my brother graduated a year ago, it's a really big milestone.", "Yes I agree, it really signifies the start of their next chapter in life.", "That must have been a burden lifted for sure!", "That must have been a burden lifted for sure!", "Yes, It has its drawbacks too, like making the grass grow, lol", "Yeah, we have to have it sometimes.", "That's usually a sign of a lack of confidence or self esteem  in ones self I believe. ", "I hope you he changes some so you can still be friends. ", "that's wonderful! i've never cheated on my husband either", "it is :( i don't know how is it possible to cheat on someone you love", "I am sure you can, it just takes dedication and effort is all!", "Then you should have no problems at all!", "I was a fast kid so I got away, but I had heard how hard they bite", "Me too, that would have been brutal", "I was also excited. In fact, I have one right now!", "Those are great titles. I am a big Nintendo fan. I can't wait for the new Metroid Prime.", "That should be fun. Pokemon is a great franchise. I have many of the handheld games.", "Yes, I was devastated to learn that because England are my favorite team!", "Yes they were doing alright and I was impressed by some of their matches.", "Oh no, sorry to hear that! Were you okay?", "I can imagine. Well atleast you can look back and laugh it off as one of 'those' days!", "Did this make you excited?", "What type of car was it?", "I hope so to, never thought this would happen, we were suppose to get a house together.", "Thank You, I hope I will also, because I deserve it, and so do you.", "That sounds embarrassing, what happened after?", "That sounds like what I would have done too", "What a Jerk. Did you let him know he was being rude?", "hat a Jerk. Did you let him know he was being rude?", "you should let him know now.", "I loved my grandparents on my mother's side , so I understand how you feel. ", "I was very close to mine. They are like parents but more fun.", "I don't know. I had a cute beaver and there was just a head and eyes left of some small animal that looked like him left in my yard. ugh.", "thanks", "That's fun, my friend is getting married next year, how big was the wedding?", "Oh I see, well that's still nice!", "That is very sad, did he ever get sober?", "That is so great, I hope you have found some healing and closure to the difficulties it caused when you were younger. ", "Wow, that's quite a move. Did he say why he's staying in Samoa so long?", "I can understand that. It's hard to say goodbye to a friend, I hope you can stay in contact with him.", "Oh man that's a bad situation. Was this vase of any sentimental value, or was it really expensive or what?", "That might be a good idea, even if just to clear you conscience of the guilt.", "Wow that is terrible, I hope he got to live a long life before that happened.", "Thats terrible, at least he wasnt a puppy I guess.", "I can imagine you would be, wouldnt want that to happen again.", "Crazy they wont even eat vegetables but they will eat rat poison.", "How did  he manage to do that?", "I mean you said he barely passed it though. Must have been slim pickings when it came to giving out the sholarships.", "What college did he end up going to?", "Ah, yes, the lucrative writing career.", "Did you get it done?", "Oh, nicely done, thats impressive!", "That is really awful. Did they take very much?", "I bet that is a terrible feeling of betrayal. Friends should be more trustworthy. ", "Oh no, did it end up okay?", "I'm glad to hear it turned out okay.", "Wow, it's a wounder you did not get killed!", "Do you have any lasting damage? ", "I was in a accident years ago and found glass coming out of my scalp for weeks. So I know how it is.", "It would have been easier to room with your brother isntead of a random roomate ,I bet.", "Strange they ask you to pay for college, but offer few choices.", "That's great! That time with the kids will really be worth it, ultimately.", "Yeah, it's a good thing that you have a lot of time for other more important things now.", "I did too, honestly. I have really improved them myself, good to hear that you have too.", "Although I still deal with stress occasionally, I know exactly what you mean. ", "Why were you nervous about it? Usually drinking means to loosen up and have fun.", "I can see that, i had my first beer at 13 due to my brother but knew it was wrong at my age.", "I totally understand. But I guess as a friend you also have to be happy for him and one day you will get your happiness too", "Remember that the universe has a perfect timing for everything. Being with someone isn't everything, be comfortable and enjoy your own company and love will come when you least expect it :) ", "I bet so. I've never done anything like that before.", "That is surprising. Usually these things are a popularity contest.", "Yes, but there are other ways to discipline them then yelling. I hurt their feelings.", "That is true, especially when I'm not feeling well.", "You must have been thrilled! There is nothing like a first car. Did you love it?", "No way -- THAT'S the best. Paid for (I'm assuming) *and* running. Do you hope to do the same for your kids when it's time?", "Damn, I wish I had a car myself. What was the occasion?", "Cool, 16th birthday or what?", "what did you do?", "that was the right move!", "That's impressive, sounds like a smart young man.", "Sounds like it, Good for you guys!", "Ahh yes,  must have been a very nice surprise! Did you play Mario on it?", "Well thats one way to get your kids to do household chores!", "What athletics did you participate in?", "Man i know that feeling. But sounds like you worked hard.", "When did he graduate? Sounds like a really cool moment to share with him.", "I graduated that year too! Cool to see that you were as excited as he likely was.", "I am very sorry to hear that, that must be terrible....", "I undertand that. People are crazy like that, I never understood it", "That is something I want to do when I get older, I miss the golden days!", "I bet it was, to catch up after awhile, few things really compare", "That's tragic, I haven't had to deal with anything like that yet.", "I hope so too, and I hope that you don't have to deal with anything like that anytime soon.", "So your saying your faithful and love her.", "Sounds like you got your priorities straight good man.", "Wow, go you! I am proud of you, it can be tough to do!", "That is what matters, best of luck using it friend!", "That is an amazing thing. Being cheated on is one of the worst things that can happen when ones enters a bond like a relationship.", "I am sure that you two will have a happy and loving life together especially if she reciprocates your desire to never cheat. ", "How exciting, are you from France?", "When did she move out there?", "It's been over 10 years since i've worked out!", "yes i did and i have slowly gotten back into it.", "No, but I do hate those, too! We were in bumper to bumper traffic, and this woman is putting on her makeup.  She doesn't notice when the car in front of her moves, and we miss the light. Ugh!", "LOL! Not my place to judge.  I was so hopping mad about having to sit through that stupid light again. ", "Well it took some time for me to cope up because I really put a lot of efforts, however I got to understand that it should be rather taken as a learning experience", "True, and guess what ! Next morning I got a call from a company which I least expected.", "Thank you! I'm working through it and I have come up with several solutions to this debt problem.", "Thank you so much! I think it will all work out!", "HaHa What kind of food did they leave for you? Did you say anything to them?", "LOL It really shouldn't be funny but for some reason you are making me laugh! I guess that will teach them to leave their lunch sitting around! haha", "omg congratulations! Thats a great achievement and must give you so much pride and motication for the future", "All the best for your future and your role aswell! ", "You are right.Florida is a big state with lot's of people.", "The odds must be astronomical, almost like winning the lottery.", "Did you watched the game? The Croatians were warriors out there.", "That goal took them to the world cup final", "I feel that man, Parents like that care for their family a lot.", "I am in that boat at times where i live.", "I know that feeling, good for you!", "Yes, those are awesome feelings, I crave that all the time", "well he did have a right to be angry (depending on how you broke it ofc)", "oh darn thats just abit rude and unnecessary. I hope everything is ok now ", "Yeah i did. I have visited him once i was up and running. He was so chuffed see me breathing", "God's grace it did worked out well. We became buddies over the time", "sibling fights worth living for.. I wish  i had one.", "you would know better hehe!!", "Well happy early birthday! I hope you have a great day!", "I bet, I hope you get everything you want!", "Sorry to hear that. Do you have more firends now?", "Great.", "What is it about their style of play that you're not a fan of?", "I see where you're coming from. ", "I'm not too familiar with Tennis, Is he known to be a winner? ", "Wow that's neat! Crazy to hear he lost then as you said.", "What exciting news! Did you find out ahead of time what the gender of the baby was?", "What is 2000 yen equal to in U.S. currency?", "It sure sounds like it. I think healthcare in Japan is much more affordable that here in America, do you agree?", "Oh, okay, well I watched a documentary about healthcare in other countries. I understand that doesn't apply here.", "She offered to help me out financially with something that was really stressing me out.", "I fell off the back porch steps and broke my wrist. It required surgery.", "Thanks! I feel like I am. I have double up on milk consumption haha..", "yes, especially if you travel a lot and for a long time. Is it for work?", "Where do you go the most?", "That is nice! I wish I can go to those countries", "Wow ! that sound's really awesome. I wish I could have gone there. But surely not for work !", "I wish you all the best pal ! You will surely rock !", "Maybe something in your life  makes you very stress. You should try to relax before go to sleep.", "You konw, sometimes consulting  a psy is a good investment. Dont be afraid to do that.", "That sounds very sad. I am very sorry to hear you experienced that. ", "Huh, I see. Well good for him!", "What happened?", "Oh, no. That's awful! Did you report something that had occurred at your job? ", "Yeah, that's good. It's hard to know whether to blow the whistle sometimes. It could always come back for you. I'm glad that it sounds like it worked out.", "Yeah, navigating those sorts of things is treacherous, but as long as you know you're doing the right thing, that's all you can do. ", "That can be pretty hard to swallow, do you stay in touch? It's easier these days with the likes of social media. How do you fill that void?", "That's such a shame, we grieve any kind of loss, I suppose. Perhaps the wedding would bring you closer together?", "I hope it works out for you, life is too short. Fill your life with wonderful things and wonderful things will surely happen.", "The world is the biggest sports competition worldwide, right after the Olympics.", "I do not like to watch hockey.You can't see the puck.", "I stand behind him. Compared to the rest of the world we are to easy on illegal immigrants and this is coming from a Mexican American. ", "How so because I want everyone in this place to be safe? You need to google immigration in other parts of the world and you will realize how awesome it is here.", "It's sad that you have such a small mind.", "It does happen sometimes. Has it ever occurred to you?", "You must have felt terribly guilty when you realized! Happens to all of us", "Brain just wants to work against you?", "I would get that a lot in school back in the day i feel it's pretty normal to have those moments.", "Oh, man. That's rough. I'm sorry. Are friends helping?", "Friends I know who have been through rough breakups often say that physical activity helps. That, and time. But still -- it's difficult!", "Holy smokes - thats unbelievable.  I gave up on playing those scratch off games", "How often do you play?", "Were you using it to get to a specific place?", "I hope you were able to get it turned right back on in order to have directions to get where you were going.", "True, just don't like how the world is inching toward a conflict that could spill over to a nuclear war.", "Exactly, its truly very sad times at the moment", "That's sad. Sorry you had to go through that.", "I would have peed in my pants if i was there.", "How do you feel now after so long being there?", "That is a great feeling i bet! Good job man!", " At first, there were no supplies. But yes, we ended up OK.", "Thanks.", "Yes, many. Would you like to tell me about it?", "Surely you were able to explain that this was out of your control.", "That is terrible.  Were you able to do anything about it?", "Did you speak to a counselor, priest, or family member about it?", "Yes.  I tried distracting myself with tv and internet, but i kept thinking of them.", "Till they returned home.  It was really a fairly bleak experience, and one which i am not anxious to repeat.", "I believe the sooner you start the better it is ! It also depends upon your passion for the sport.", "Yeah true. When did you start?", "True ! Conventions give you an opportunity to learn as you never know what kind of situations will prop up", "Do you have a professional degree in first aid?", "Texas does that to us! It helps we live in a place where air conditioning is the norm. Or do you like spending time out in the heat?", "I know what you mean. It's like you have to dress for both the outside *and* the inside. That's great you have a pool in which to escape, though! ", "Oh no! Hopefully renters insurance covered it!", "Well that is terrible for him but I am glad at least some of it is being taken care of!", "Ugg I am sorry to hear that. Sometimes dealing with land lords is a tough business.", "Were they fond memories?", "That's understandable. I hope everyone you know is doing well from back then!", "Oh wow that sounds awful! was it graphic?", "I'm so sorry you had to go through that.", "No, we are working on sorting things out but I am still very hurt.", "Yes, unfortunately", "What song was it? Did you know it?", "Man that is crazy! Especially that song!", "I consider myself somewhat knowledgable about them too, it's very fulfilling being able to help other people with their problems sometimes.", "Yeah, sometimes it can be annoying though because they come to you with really easy problems to fix and you feel like they should know how to do it themselves.", "Did you take that chance and redo it?", "I hope the email will bring you good news", "I know that pain!  Did he keep you up watching tv or video games?", "Because mine does the same thing... If its not video games its the TV on full blast haha! Tell him you need your beauty sleep.", "So have you gotten to open it yet??", "Wow! I would have told her to fill out the paperwork herself getting your hopes up like that.", "Oh no!  Well what he didn't know won't hurt him.  Hopefully you can get a replacement.", "Awww well I am glad he was understanding about it.", "Thats unfortunate. It is a difficult decision to make. Sometimes we are put in those situations and they take a toll on us.", "I hope he is in a better place now. How did you have Blackjack for?", "So you all had relatively all his life. Yes, it was the right thing to do. Did you get another pet instead?", "I like to help others! It was not an easy thing to do, but it seemed like it was the right thing to do. ", "I think once was 4 and the other was 2. I helped her with the 4 year old. ", "yes. I am saving all i can for when the storm comes.", "I don't get to have moments of joy in those situations.", "I did.  It took me back to my childhood.", "When i was a child, i would steal dollars from my brother's coin collection and go to the arcade.", "I imagine that made you feel empathetic to his plight.", "Please tell me that you gave him some money to help him out.", "Of course, she's my best friend.  I just feel bad that I had to bail on her for the third time in a row.", "I'm taking her out to breakfast when she gets off work Sunday morning.  Time to see what this IHOB is all about!", "What did you and your friends do on that day?", "That does sound fun! Was the food good?", "Oh no, did you report it to the police?", "I have some hot chocolate that can help calm you down a bit.", "No! THAT is painful! He must have felt awful! Did he have insurance to cover anything?", "I am so sorry! But he does sound like a true friend if he's actively paying you back!", "That is exciting when your team wins, have you always been a hockey fan?", "That is awesome! I am from Chicago, so when the cubs won the world series I felt the same way. ", "I bet! always good when new life is born.", "Oh that must be a handful for your parents.", "I am sorry to hear that.I hope she gets better.", "That is horrible news.Your family should make sure she gets comfortable on her last moments.", "It was a huge upset.The England team was the favorite.", "No.I do not care about England.", "Of course! I'm human! ;-) Beyond the disappointments, I think it's how we respond that defines us, you know?", "Probably even harder! Is there another fellowship you have your eye on?", "Oh, sending you all the best vibes! And congratulations ahead of time, Doctor!", "Oh really? How did that make you feel, honestly?", "I can imagine. The unknown can be very scary and make you worry.", "It was a third date! But now I have been with her for the past 2.5 years :) So it wasn't too bad!", "Yep we have definitely told the story to a bunch of our friends and just laugh about it!", "There are many different variables that need to be taken into account-- things that I don't usually deal with on a day to day basis.  But my extra prep at night has made it so that it's seeming easy.", "Not usually; this is an unusual case!", "I went to work and got a big raise. I rushed home to tell her. ", "When i got home, all of the furniture, my wife and kids were gone.", "Please tell me you caught him!! That is awful!!", "You almost gave me a heart attack with that story!!", "That was very nice of them. Was it for a special occasion?", "Well, now you know they do! That was very thoughtful of them.", "Where did you see it? ", "I bet, what did it look like?", "What made it so difficult?", "Did you tell the teacher then we know atleast you had tried.", "Wonderful! Your team I guess? That's exciting!", "It's great you give them the respect for that, your team or not! When is the Final?", "What is it about?", "Sounds like you will likely do well.  Do you expect any problems with other people?", "That's so sweet and fortunate that she was able to do that for you. I wish I could do that.", "You're right, and I do all of the time. What kind of car did you get?", "I remember those cars! How long did it last you?", "That is such a stressful thing to come home to!", "I am so sorry you had to go through that!", "Oh how nice! Did you get to visit with friends and family?", "I'll bet. It's always nice to visit, but it can be hard to say goodbye.", "You still remember what you got for it?  It must have been memorable!  What was it?", "Oh I know that feeling!  My family was the same way, and I still remember coming home after my last day of 6th grade and seeing that same SNES box sitting on my bed.", "Probably just before 6am, and I had to wake up for work at 9:30, so needless to say, I called out this morning. ", "I hope so, too! And no beer tonight!", "That is riduculous.  Death is inevitible.", "Of course, but unavoiable.  Death is not really the concern, but dying.", "Life is like that.  It is not what you know but who you know.", "No need to kiss butt.  Maintain your integrity and enjoy life on it's terms.", "What battle? What were you doing?", "Is that a video game?", "That's never fun.  Did you have any notes to help you remember?", "That wasn't very nice of them.  It's quite common to forget things.  Hopefully next time you remember!", "Wow, I'm sure it will work. I've very hopeful for you.", "My wife and I have been together for 12 years, tried years ago and nothing. Waited a while and then started trying again and we got it. Fate has a funny way of working out.", "That is great. With who are you going?", "That is great.", "Wow. What do you think will happen?", "Well make sure you listen to your Dr.'s advice!", "Congratulations!!! That can be both exciting and terrifying? Where are you on that spectrum? ;-)", "I am sending you all the best vibes. Is it in a field you've worked in before?", "Happily, a lot of employers seem to be willing to extrapolate that if you had talents in one industry, they'd apply to another. You can always learn about different subjects; you can't always learn how to bring that special spark that customer service needs. Best of luck!", "I've been in that boat. What do you think the issue was?", "That stinks. I've been interviewing also. I had two places call me back for three interviews and then no offer. So I feel ya. Just keep looking.", "It went ok, i was tired after", "Not really no", "Why didn't you have any friends? ", "What games did you play at the time?", "Sorry to hear that, what happened? ", "That's awful, people need to be more careful", "Did you tell him, or did he find out?", "Awe, I am sorry. In those instances, nobody wins. I hope you guys came out of it stronger than before", "what was the team activity? ", "I'm happy it went well for you!", "What is your health issue?", "Sorry to hear that. I have same issues with my knees.", "Oh no, were you able to tell her you did it?", "Ugh, I'm sure that was hard.  I'm sorry you had to go through that.", "I SO agree. I would not want to live like that. And it's one thing if they're only affecting themselves -- but when it's aimed at others -- the worst.", "Isn't that weird? I mean it takes *energy* to be that negative! Does your brother feel that too? Or just can't/won't see it?", "How is she feeling?", "That's terrific. Hopefully she continues to get better and better. ", "How did that make you feel", "Did you confront him", "OH I am sorry to hear that. How?", "Oh no! I hope you can fix it!", "I remember those days, what subject?", "It sounds hard! What grade did you get?", "I have the same feeling but for the last 90s and early 2000's. Being an adult is no fun.", "Yes or rich. When I was a kid I wanted to grow up. Now that I'm old I want to be a kid again.", "Did you decline? I would not feel very comfortable until i got to know the family. ", "I agree, you made the right choice. And it gives you time to get to know the hosts before a future sleepover!", "Oh, well that isn't fair of your boss! Most people wouldn't work at all while are maternity leave, he should be grateful!", "Well, sounds like your boss is stressed out too much and taking it out on you! Maybe he needs a long break!", "Do you mean LeBron James? I was hoping he'd come to Miami!", "I wish he would have! The Heat can use his help! Haha!", "That must've been awesome.

She is so pretty was starved and overbred. I am so happy she is no longer being abused.", "Yeah. To make things worse, he was one day away from receiving his PHD. Really devastated everyone who knew him.", "It just goes to show how fragile life is. Makes you appreciate what you have.", "That's cool. What did you guys all do?", "I bed it was exciting just because of the idea of getting caught!", "Oh wow! Wasn't expecting that.

How'd it go, Ramsey?", "Well, you get experience points on that. Hopefully, the next dish is better.", "It's been raining hard here in Virginia too. Did you get whisked away in a flash flood?", "Some days trapped inside the house aren't always bad. At least you don't have to think too hard on what to do.", "I am working on selling stuff online. It requires a lot of research", "For sure! Except I can't get much of it as I need to save my money for business lol", "That's horrible. Did they divorce?", "Of course! betrayal is horrifying to go through. I hope he became a better man for it?", "That's so sweet.", "Was it for your birthday?", "I hope I work with nice people like that one day.", "There is so much different kinds it can be daunting sometimes on where to find the good stuff.", "Oh wow. I would suggest using Spotify and then make a radio playlist on your favorites artists. That is how I find newer but similar music.", "Sometimes it takes a while to really hone into your preferences. ", "A+ for creativity.", "Never ventured, nothing gained and all.", "Seems like things turned out for the better. What is she going to do with the winnings?", "Sounds like the responsible thing to do. Hopefully she gets a new one soon and her luck continues.", "How exciting! Where is your friend originally from?", "So awesome! Has she ever been to America before?", "That is good stuff.  I bet that made you feel good!", "You are so much fun!  Jogging gives off a pretty good feeling too!", "I hate that too! Do you make him clean it up?", "That's a tough situation to be in. I would just take all his belongings to the dump and be done with it. Maybe he can stay there too.", "The best thing is not having to explain anything to anyone. I love it", "Two years since I broke up with my ex. We had agreed that he would be the only one working back then", "Really? Why?", "I don't like vacations that make you feel like you are still at home. Where do you live?", "Yes! He was in front of a grocery store..so hot! and so many passed by and he was asking for help. He got a great home!", "No I adopted him out to people I knew- he wasn't happy with all my already rescued animals. He is very happy now :)", "Wow, that's interesting. What do you do with it?", "Oh no- Well I am the opposite. I rescue bambi and small critters :)", "That's too bad to hear. What's wrong with her?", "That's incredibly awful.

He ended up becoming a pastor.", "He deserved it. He was fighting for his life.", "That's too bad. What seems to be wrong with him?", "Doesn't sound good at all.

I hope you get the job!", "In a city in michigan. One of the top dangerous cities in the USA", "Can't always be helped. That is why I don't walk at night a lot- or heck even during the day", "I never use it and I don't think I ever will", "To lose weight obviously. Id rather have surgery.", "Wow that's awesome. Congratulations", "Did you like the food?", "I can afford to buy my kids things. I always donate their old stuff instead of selling it.", "I try to give back.", "That is so disgusting!", "I probably would have done the same thing.", "I am a teacher so I understand.  You must be working well with him!  Do teachers know what accommodations to make or how to differentiate for him to be successful in the classroom?", "The amount of pride he will have in himself with speak volumes.  Let his new teachers know what works for him.  You are his best advocate!", "I'm studying psychology and it is so boring I have thought of quitting several times.", "I'm gonna keep going.

Maybe you can get a promotion if you get it all done.", "Maybe a cat. They are really sassy.", "Thats the fun part lol", "Thats very admirable.", "Enabling is pretty bad. People don't learn if someone is always saving them from every thing.", "I was suprised that I wasnt too scared. Its really good and not too terrifying", "I hope you like it as much as I do. If it gets any scarier Ill have to quit though", "Haha I bet! Always great to have everyone together, though, really gets your mind off all the stresses of daily life.", "I'm sorry. Are you sure you did that bad?", "They'll be other interviews.", "Game of thrones is the top one. I want it to last forever", "I am. It better end well because there wasnt even a season this year.", "I am. I am in a very dangerous neighborhood so you just never know if it's going to get you and the police don't show up.", "Yes, I have thought about it. I have pepper spray and a few big dogs- I am saving up to move out of here soon and I have cameras", "payday is the best day! What are you doing to do?", "OH wow! I feel you there and it's totally worth it! If you have to sit- get a donut pillow to not sit on your tailbone.", "Oh that's horrible. Who's Brian Lawyer?", "I've never heard of him, but that sucks. How'd he die?", "Oh wow that's horrible.", "It's creatine. I'm hoping I continue to make progress while using it.", "It's very well researched and is proven safe and effective. One of the few supplements that actually work.", "Ohh no, were you pulled over wrongly?", "How fast did they say you were going?", "Thats great news.", "That is great news.", "Did you really steal it or was it more like borrowing without asking first?", "Hmmmm. with no job and no way to pay it back I sure hope he can be understanding.", "What show was it?", "Oh. I've never seen that show. I know it has die hard fans though.", "I get food delivered several times a week. It's terrible.", "I know. I have to do better. It is a real waste.", "Those jobs are hard.

You sound like you already have a good head on your shoulders.", "I think they all are. At least 100 or 200.

How old was he?", "Oh wow, I can't imagine losing my dad at 67. I hope you make it through these hard times, stay strong!", "Right on! That's cool to hear. Everyone likes to rag on older people driving. Glad to hear she's the exception. What kind of car does she drive?", "Haha... That sounds awesome. Wish I could carpool with her. I hate driving, but it sounds like she loves it.", "I have a friend who plans ahead like that.  I'm a last minute gal.  I think you will be less stressed by planning ahead.", "Not to mention enjoy the actual party, too!  Are you celebrating anything in particular?", "Oh my god, I would have been so embarrassed! How'd you react?", "So you left work at lunch time? Did you come back or were you too ashamed?", "Yeah, I mean things happen. Better to put it in the back of your head and keep trucking along.", "Plan on doing both, actually. We're going to Florida for about a week and then after we return from that trip I'm going to just bum out for a week.", "Yeah, I think it'll really allow me to recoup and be 110% ready to attack work by the time the vacation is over.", "Good to hear you're confident! I'm sure you'll do well if you've been studying.", "You don't have to tell me, I know you'll ace it! You sound well prepared.", "Yeah, everyone speeds. Terrible to get caught. Hopefully you weren't speeding in a neighborhood, were you?", "Yeah, I know. Adrenaline gets to you. You're human. At least you were doing it in a sort of safe way, it sounds like. Some cops are just out to get you.", "Don't go check it out. That never turns out well in horror movies. Bring a gun then or another person.", "I would do that! Or call a friend over- Get a weapon too.", "They want to come in my yard and house and I have dogs. They just have done this many times now trying to stop the led and I am so over it- No one is coming in my house again.", "I don't think I have to let them in my house but they are out everyday. it's hard with dogs.", "That is lucky!", "I'm happy you got to avoid that!", "Seriously? How? What was the mistake? Did you talk to him about it, or your boss?", "That's sneaky... and hard to explain. I'm sorry you have to deal with that hard situation. What do you think you'll do about it?", "Wap you must be disgusted with the farting. were you mad? or are you used to this kind of situations?", "Yes i do have 2 siblings, older brother and younger sister, but we dont fart in front of eachother, i love them!", "Sounds like the good old days seemed more relaxing and care free.", "Oh man! I grew up on that cartoon too!", "Older? I'm thirty! But now I have kids and money is tight sometimes. I might still buy the guys soon.", "Hey, it's all good. I didn't mean it in a confrontational way, I just thought it was funny.", "That's awesome, the exact opposite is true for me. My little brother is just about to start his first year of college next month!", "Yes, I hope so. Well, I hope your brother can put his degree to good use and make some moolah!", "Who knows.. I've dealt with slow internet all my life. Wish I could finally get a decent ISP.", "Not really, especially since they vary sometimes by region. We should just move to Europe, I hear they have great internet there because they actually view it as important.", "Yes people and pets. Too soon. So it definitely makes you think everyone is going to die any minute and life is meaningless.", "yes very true. I try but when you go through trauma it affects you in different ways. Mine is to be terrified and want to die too at times.", "Thats so scary, do you believe in ghosts?", "Hope it's a friendly one at least.", "Haha.  Makes it hard to take care of business, and you'd think she'd get the hint from the locked door!  I would have sat longer \"just because.\"", "Maybe her first class seat should be on the royal porcelain seat!", "You should put yourself out there and meet some new people.  Just start exploring the city and you are bound to meet others!", "It is.  It isn't healthy to be by yourself for too long.  Humans are social creatures!", "Wow, no parent should ever abuse their children like that. Did you or anyone do anything?", "Yea I totally understand where you're coming from. Hopefully someone nearby was able to call CPS or law enforcement.", "Apparently my legs grew and I didn't notice! I do workout four days a week. ", "I guess you're right. That's one way to measure progress I didn't think of before! ", "Where did this happen?", "Oh wow, yeah that sounds gross! I agree with the wasted food too. There are starving people all around the world!", "I have no idea. I was really looking forward to a meal from there today.", "That's exactly how I felt.", "Why would you always get fake checks? That would drive me crazy.", "Well that was a surprise I bet.", "O really? Any specific reason for this fear?", "Flying scares a lot of people but it's safer then driving over all.", "I have to say that is a true blessing. I have a wonderful mother myself. Why do you say she is a good mom?", "She sounds like a wonderful person.", "Oh really, congrats! yes when your kids acomplish something it is very happy for us parents!", "Thats so cool, do you have any othe children or just one? when you have more they are very competitive", "He couldve killed you!", "I really hate bad drivers. ", "2 years. I thought I missef my ex but wr talk often and I definitely don't want that headache lol", "Thanks! Hopefully he is a decent driver", "That must of been no fun.", "Hopefully she doesn't do it again.", "I'm not too fond of them myself. Why don't you like them?", "Yeah, especially fire ants. Those are nasty little buggers.", "Sweet, was it a difficult test?", "Yea, same, it's nice to be out of school. All that learning pays off though!", "Yea, one time I met an Uncle who I hadn't seen since I was a kid. I always thought he was a cool guy, but the dude just spewed racist stuff the whole time. What's worse, is that they were comments about my family.", "Yea, I honestly hope I never have to deal with that guy again. It just sucks knowing I'm related to someone like that.", "Well, that escalated quickly. I'm hoping this is not real?", ":( That is messed up, did he/she show any warning signs before their passing? It's not your fault by the way.", "Did you hurt your self?", "That wasn't nice of them.", "Sorry for the bad news.", "I know she will make it.", "Congratulations! What are you doing to prepare for it?", "That sounds like a lot of fun. What kind of cake did you select?", "It probably stank a lot too.", "You probably should have moved with a shovel of something, instead of running over it", "I am too! I am really not a fan on how he is handling relations with Russia. What makes him annoying to you?", "I know right? Doesn't seem right. Especially with the whole Russian interference with the election.", "Me too! These kids in this house are driving me crazy.  They need to get back on a schedule.", "I think mine have two weeks left.", "That must of been no fun.", "Did you have a flashlight?", "Oh no. Ive only been once but it was great. What happened?", "That terrible. Were you able to get a refund?", "13. She is the worst sometimes.", "we are poor. The free ones are no good.", "What was it about?", "What did you spend it on?", "What movie was it?", "I have never seen it.", "That would be scary! Can you imagine what the dmv is like? ", "That would be an amazing neighbor! I would be so worried!", "I will stay with her forever.", "I will stay with her forever.", "He must of been crazy.", "Yes, id he do it for money?", "Good luck with that. Do you found yourself confortable in your new job?", "I understand", "Holy moly, that must've been a very depressing sight. Did the police end up finding the culprit?", "I do hope nothing of value was stolen. I would be frantic if someone stole my family heirlooms.", "The visit would be the best gift ever and the paint job a huge bonus.", "How far did they have to travel?", "I haven't started looking yet. The kids are all going to be in school now and I can work outside the home though.", "I was a pharmac technician but I think I want to do something different.", "I think he annoys most people.", "His tweets are rude and ill informed and he never apologizes for anything.", "I bet you were starving! Did they say why they were so late? ", "Did you get it free? I would be so annoyed!", "Aw man, I've been there before. Has anyone tried using it?", "That really sucks. Fortunate to hear that no one misused it though. They are typically pretty fast at sending you a new one.", "Wow, that sounds unique. What exactly do you sell?", "Oh! Well duh, silly me. I thought it was food or something. Do you sell other things too?", "Did you call the police?", "They will find who did it.", "Is he unable to take care of himself now?", "How caring of you.", "That sucks, did you still have fun?", "What did you bowl?", "She annoys me as well! She seemed pretty fraudulent in the last election.", "Yes, especially for all those emails they found on her private server. Despicable.", "That is awesome! What subject was it in?", "I sure hope that you did. Statistics is tough!", "I hear that, my friend. It ain't exactly easy living with mine, but ya gotta do it for love.", "It has to be enough - that's the whole reason why we seek out a soulmate. I do hope things get better.", "Nice, have you ever won any tournaments?", "Awesome, I bet you felt great! There just isn't a feeling like winning a tournament and making money playing a game you love", "Oh man, why are you even still sending him money?", "Ahhh, so you're upset at your past self? We all make mistakes, man, it's good. What we think is good for us sometimes turns out to not be, but hindsight is twenty twenty.", "So much for them being up front for you. Man $300 for what thats a lot.", "Yea construction zones are crazy, so often nooones there!", "That would be exciting! What do you plan to do with your winnings? ", "That could lead to a gambling problem! I always run away with my winnings.", "Yes, I hate that so much. The sound of screeching and crushing metal is traumatizing.", "Unfortunately, yes. I had to get a few staples in my head but my car was totaled...", "Smart move - it's always a swell idea to get ahead of work so that we can do the things we want to do in life.", "Yup, I used to procrastinate all the time, but I think I am getting better at doing things ahead of time. And it feels so much better to get trivial things out of the way.", "Aw man, that has to be rough. Were you guys really close?", "That's even more saddening. Did you get to say somewhat of a goodbye to him at their funeral?", "Did you return the socks?", "That is mean.", "Me too but it is still one more month of heat coming but it also means September is on the way.", "Why do you say that?", "I don't like 100+ degree days myself!", "I like driving closer to the ground.", "I could sure but I will be starting over on payments, I might look into it.", "At the time it was a change and I like the ride of it, but I did not realize I would miss the sedan as much as I did.", "They are bugs, huge, and they fly. One crawled over my foot at my grandmas house over the weekend.", "I ran in the house.", "Congratulations. Are you excited?", "You'll do fine. I look at new things as adventures. ", "That would be depressing, did you plan it yourself or did someone plan it for you?", "Maybe if you post to social media, a bunch of random strangers will show up.", "Ouch, was it an unfair test or did he not study?", "Yea, hope he can make it up the rest of the year.", "Ewww, throw that away ASAP.", "Throw it in your neighbor's trash can. I'm sure they would understand?", "What a nice gesture! What did you get to eat after not eating for so long?", "What kind of toppings did it have on it?", "Oh no! What was it?", "Yikes! I hope you didn't have any car damage.", "I hate it when people laugh at me, it's so humiliating!", "Oh god, that's the worst part. The shame afterwards....", "Yea man, that's good karma!", "Me too. Its always the worst when you are trying to get into the carpool line.", "That's awesome. I hope ro retire one day.", "What are you going to do now?", "It's something a family told me about. Small portions of healthy food and exercise.", "Lots of water and no soda. yikes", "I have never heard of an EDM, what is that?", "Lol- sounds like fun!

You are being super gross! lol. TMI", "For sure. I did not have any family down there though. I begged and had enough to not be homeless. It was a miracle. ", "I lived in a hotel. Had an abusive husband who would do things to make us homeless behind my back. I was able to get help from a friend- I eventually had enough miracles to get the heck out of there and away from him.", "They are really nice cars! Have you driven one?", "They are nice looking cars and I have heard are great to off road in!", "That's not cool. Did you put your name on it?", "I'm so sorry that happened to you, better luck next time.", "I started drinking a gallon of water everyday. I couldn't hold it anymore.", "I will thanks for that piece of advice.", "Not having to pay bills. That is the worst.", "I never knew how much a vacation cost until I took my three kids on one.", "I used to enjoy slap boxing in middle school, but I stopped because one time my friend was backing up to block my attacks, and there was a girl lying down behind him. He didn't know and ended up stepping on her face; she started crying and I just felt terrible about it.", "She was, but still, we were kids, it had to have hurt. Anyway, thanks for listening, man!", "Sorry, lol, either way, thanks. You have a great day or night or whatever it is!", "Oh thats strange. I haven't seen that.

But I'd love to hear why it excites you?", "true! Thank you- It is very real", "Ouch, did it make you late to work?", "That's great to know there are still good people in this world.", "I bet! Could you see yourself walking around?", "I bet that brought back a lot of memories! ", "Why? Are you from New York?", "Nice, do you play football too?", "What kind of gamer?", "I love video games. ", "Well he tried to cut everyone off and it's just wreckless. So many people die. I really hate it when bad drivers think they are not lol", "The police don't really do anything here. It's like the wild wild west. Almost no one ever gets in trouble that is why they constantly drive 20 over and cut you off at the last second etc.", "That is great! Always nice to see a good dad for once", "Can you give me an example?", "What's the Braves?", "Okay cool, I'm not that big into sports. ", "I had three bouquets of flowers waiting for me. I was shocked.", "My mom and my grandparents.", "I got cards form uncles and aunts too.", "Are you quitting your job?", "That will be a nice change of pace! Do you have plans for retirement?

So, I'm glad you still have some optimism!", "Wow! Did you report him to the police?", "Sounds like that person has boundary issues.

I would just take it as a lesson and try to control your drinking next time when important events are in the near future.", "How did it go?", "How long did it take to prepare for?", "Aw, sorry about that! Did you have a pet you could take there with you?", "Yeah, I have a dog and I take it to the park sometimes. It can help you feel less lonely for sure.", "Dang, that's quite a large amount of money to lose. Hopefully it went to someone who needs it.", "That would be nice. Maybe he'll go and buy some candy from the candy store.", "I try not to have any friends.", "I advice not to trust anyone ever. Stay to yourself and be sad my friend.", "I do not want to be the first one.", "It was a terrible day for me.", "Every day, i see it in my head.", "Best of luck! Have you won in the past?", "Wow you're pretty lucky...I can never win those things", "Are you a mother? It could be a maternal thing/instinct.", "Oh, well you could still have protective traits as a male. How old is your cousin?", "That's nice of your dad - it's sometimes hard to get a car on your own. What kind of truck is it?", "Nissan's are top of the line. I hope you get a lot of use out of it.", "What is the trick", "That is a good dog then", "Aw, that sucks. Everyone gets old eventually, how old is she/he?", "That's good to hear, I hope he feels and gets better", "I think those people don't actually eat that much, it just seems like it though.", "If he's taller/bigger than you it would make sense if he doesn't gain any weight", "That seems like a lot of pizza rolls, how do you feel?", "Hey, we all pig out at some point", "That's too bad. It's nice to have friends to revel in our victories. Why don't you get yourself a beer and relax on the porch?", "If you need someone to join in, just let me know!", "I am sorry to hear that.  Any certain areas you think you could have done better on?", "Don't be so hard on yourself.  Most people can't even spell physics.", "Oh no what happened", "I am sorry, I hope you find it", "That's so sad to hear! How did she pass? If you don't mind me asking.", "That's terrible, my friend. How are you holding up?", "I love it when it rains.", "Sunny days are very hot and i do not like that.", "Nice, I usually forget a thing or two. Did you get everything you needed?", "I assume you were very prepared!", "What techniques have you learned so far though?", "I think you will do pretty well then in a street fight.", "Go on", "That's pretty cool.  Grew up with the Gameboy Color and Gameboy Advance myself", "Wow, that sucks. Did you try calling the grocery store?", "Your neighbor is a good person. I would have...given it back to you haha.", "I have a pesky, sneaky little dog like that too! Did you clean it up?", "That's good. Was she guilty when she saw you cleaning it up?", "That is disgusting, my dog does that too but in sneaky places. It's always a surprise lol", "Yeah, our dogs need to be punished and maybe trained more.", "Oh wow. Maybe they were busy doing other things? Did you find anyone else to play with?", "Sometimes playing by ourselves is how we get better.", "What kind of job", "I am sorry that happened", "Six Flags is such a fun park! Are you a fan of roller coasters?", "They are! Cedar Point has some gnarly roller coasters too.", "It truly is, the extra money helps very much.", "I want to spend time with the family.", "Well my dad got mad at my brother, honestly i feel he deserved it, but he stopped the car and broke the side window of the car.", "No just glass everywhere and a little scared.", "Wow, that's unfortunate. People don't realize that can happen but it happened to my friend when we were little.", "Sorry to hear that, recovering from any pet lose is hard.", "Did you get attacked by a big dog when you were little?", "Maybe it was because you saw your brother get attacked by one and you are scared it might happen to you.", "Did you try to go to the grocery store to give it back?", "I understand.", "Sorry to hear that. How did she pass?", "Man, very sorry to hear that. First your mom, now your aunt. Sounds like you have very unfortunate relatives.", "I do love to read as well", "That sounds so nice", "Holy moly! Sounds like you are eating well tonight!", "Well, I'm sure you can find a recipe online that uses spent lottery tickets.", "Are you homeless?", "Lol, I bet that a good looking sandwich then.", "Oh, you will probably be just fine don't worry about it too much.", "Dentist aren't people focused on trying to hurt you.", "Ut oh.. What did you eat?", "Don't worry... you only live once!", "I hate driving, I avoid it as much as possible. ", "Mine was from being in one and just being nervous about having to be in charge of things.", "Thats good to hear. Why do you thank god for her?", "Well thats nice. I thank god for my wife as well", "Well there are always bigger fish in the sea trust me.", "That is also very important to learn.", "That sucks, do you feel better now?", "Yeah, isolation can happen when you get super sad. At least you are feeling better now", "That's always a positive in my book, what kind of food was it?  What were your reservations about the restaurant before going?", "Is it in a bad part of town or is the building just bad luck or run down?", "I am sorry, that sounds bad", "Maybe it wont happen again", "Oh my gosh!  That must have been so embarrassing!", "Don't worry.  I'm sure you will never make that mistake again!", "Aw, that sucks because money was the issue. Maybe she can take a bus or something?", "Yay! I love happy endings", "Oh how scary! What happened?", "I am so sorry you had to see that. That is so bad. Did you have to call it in?", "No one knows and she will not tell me.", "If I knew i would tell you all about it.", "Parties are some times very loud.", "If my friends did that I would have a heart attack.", "What movie are you referring too?", "Oh! Well i haven't seen that yet. was the action at least somewhat decent?", "Yeah I hate waiting for the results of a long term goal", "Damn, you suck at soccer. Just kidding, good job!! lol", "Oh no.. what happened?  Are you ok?", "What did you lie to him about?", "I am sorry, he will stop eventually", "He will get better", "Wow, why does he need to drink so much?", "I'm sorry, I've dealt with something like that before and it can be very anger inducing.", "Did you do anything wrong?", "Oh.. thats horrible.  I am so sorry.", "Myself as well, friends are what make life better.", "Alone time is important but you will go crazy if you are always alone.", "It was my flip phone, it was the only one that I had.", "I have not had the money to buy a new one, so my family has no idea where I am.", "He is a terrible person! Did he even know it was your cat? What took so long...", "I hope you feel better", "What kind of cars do you like the best?", "Range Rovers are my favorite too. If you work hard you can get one!", "When did she pass away?", "Well have you been living a happy life? She would probably be happy about that.", "I am sure she is happy too", "It can be hard, but its possible", "Do you have cameras?", "I know right? It's even more worse when it's hot outside and it cooks to your car so it's harder to clean up", "Have you seen any recently? It is really sad, what gets me the most is hearing about black bears being hit.", "Poor thing, it's not fair! Drivers need to watch out!", "Well hopefully the car didn't get damaged.", "Well i would just be happy nothing too bad happened at least.", "That's frightening. Was it dark outsside?", "That's even worse. I hate being lost in general", "Oh man that stinks. What did you do in response?", "Did he ever apologize?", "I've never had a party like that myself.", "No one really likes me enough to do that for me.", "What journey?  Do tell.", "Oh Congratulations...  That is a huge accomplishment!", "I know.. we have to move to where the hospital is for three months while he recovers...", "Thank you..", "That's awesome! Did you guys do anything?", "Nice! I hope you guys did a lot of catching up!", "Wow! What a jerk for him to up and leave with no way to contact him. Was it a lot of money?", "I'm so sorry, you should see if you can find him on social media!", "Who was following you?!", "What did he look like? I would call the cops if they are stalking you.", "Yeah it does! I am so happy it does but one game wasn't working sadly.", "I did for about 4 then i had to eat something i got distracted.", "Oh snap! dude get your camera you might have found nessy.", "Probably could be a new species of gator.", "I know how that goes.  It can be hard to stay on track at the end of the semester.", "Congratulations!  Studying really pays off!", "Jeeze, I thought that only happened to me. Doesn't it just suck? I don't blame you for not picking it up, I can imagine how gross it must've been", "It's okay, most people would do that and not even care, so the fact that you even have the trashman in your mind shows that you're a good person.", "Yea, exactly. What's worse is that it really affected him, the dog was like a brother to him. Weeks turned into months and you could tell it was still eating away at him. I wish life could be easier.", "Thanks for hearing me out! You have a great day and a great life!", "Oh poor lady. I know how it is though. Sometimes our initial reaction is to laugh even when not appropriate.", "At least you recognize that it may not have been appropriate. ", "I can imagine. Was she a hoarder of some type?", "Did you see anything interesting?", "Did you tip him well for doing such a good job?", "It is not often that you get good service at a restaurant.", "I enjoy doing that after a hard day at work as well.  I hope it relaxes you!", "Now I am in the mood for Netflix!  Enjoy the new series now that you are relaxed!", "Did you punch him in the nose?", "This is why i got rid of all of my friends.", "Ah - that's a big accomplishment!!!  Did you get her a great present?", "HAHA!  That is the best tradition I've ever heard of!", "Oh man, I know the nerves can be rough, but I'm sure you're excited as well. But yea, throwing yourself into a group of new people can be rough.", "Oh wow. Well, I really hope you enjoy the new job! I have a feeling you'll do just fine.", "Hahaha, well, this is a pretty good use of your time as well though! But yea, it's so much easier when you study ahead of time. I don't know why I don't do it more often, lol.", "To be honest, I believe it. But maybe I'm just trying to make myself feel smart. Thanks for hearing me out, and I wish you luck on your test!", "Did you find anything interesting inside any of the buildings?", "Oh man, I would have freaked out! What did you do?", "That is pretty great! what show is it?", "Haven't heard of it but since your son's going to be on it i will watch it.", "As someone who was once a 19 year old man, don't be too shocked.", "Yikes he's one of the zombie drunks.   That's unfortunate.  Drinking might not be for him.", "Most do. I know a guy that kind of gets blackout drunk like that.  His brother does too.  Now neither of them drink hard liquor (well they haven't for ages now)", "It was pretty random. I saw it and it looked just like a pocket knife I used to have and lost.   I asked him where he got it. He said he found it in an old coat from ages ago and had no clue where it was from.", "Yeah it is. The old kershaws have a year marked on them (this one was 2001).  I've moved on to other things but, I still have a soft spot for a good pocket knife", "What was it?", "So everything is okay then? That's good news!", "Oh no I'm so sorry to hear that. Are you thinking about getting another one?", "Oh I understand. They say time heals all wounds, I hope it does in your case as well.", "Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. I have been to court before; it isn't as scary as it seems.", "That won't happen. Even if it does, the judge may have a good laugh and cut you some slack.", "I am guessing she is not with us anymore?", "I know the feeling i had my grandmother gone for 5 years now still miss her.", "My grades but i ended up going into his room and taking it back. I bought that myself with my own money.", "Yeah but it's my property he knows not to take what he never spent a cent on.", "I understand, I have trouble waking up early too.", "Me too, I just have to set a bunch of alarms and try my best.", "Were you worried it could be something very serious?", "That's good to hear. I'm sure you feel very relieved now.", "What was that?", "A bunch of toys and stuff?", "Another IT job.   The real question is, is the money there.", "You never know. Some places try to lowball pretty hard.   IT is a unique job.  If everything works, people wonder why they pay you.  If nothing works, people also wonder why they pay you.", "I see people walk out of the bathroom all the time without washing their hands. So gross.", "That is really disgusting. I don't think I would ever eat at his house. ", "Yeah, no doubt!", "I'm sure you aren't the worst in the class, don't say that!", "There's always next time, you just need to study harder!", "That is awful. I hope she has friends and family she can lean on during this tough time.", "I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy.  I feel so bad for her.", "That's unlucky, did you ever exchange information?", "Well I hope it all works out in the end somehow.", "What kind of dog was the costume or did it look weird?", "Well were they trying to sell something maybe?", "Mostly jobs and children.", "I did not mean to be? I wanted to tell you about how amazing she is.", "Oh, lord. Did the other person die?", "Man, i would have left and walked out right away.", "That has to make you feel so good deep inside.", "Wow, that is thoughtful.  Thoughtfulness will help him go a long way in life.", "Wow! How can someone do that to someone with someone so close?", "That's such a shame. And shame on his brother, too!", "What did you watch/?", "So what was it?  You are making me scared.", "Oh man that is pretty scary.", "You should probably see a priest then.", "The package wasn't too beat up", "They have a good return policy.  Just annoying as hell. ", "Are you baby crazy?  Let me guess.. 30-ish?", "That sucks. Missed opportunity or biological problems?", "Whatever it is, you seem excited. What is it?", "Vacations are sooooo nice!!!  I hope you have an amazing one@!", "Yes, it wasn't a bad wreck.  But this buffoon thought he was more important than anyone else, and flew up beside us in the emergency lane.!", "Well, I think he got what he deserved.  About 10 seconds later, the police flew up that same emergency lane!", "Why are you there all alone?", "I hope you aren't too lonely!", "Oh no. Why did he steal?", "Sometimes they have a reason, and it doesn't make him a bad person depending on the reason.", "That was so nice of her. I'm sure that you really appreciated her for doing that.", "Maybe you have a budding chef on your hands.", "A bit of nostalgia, huh?  It is always wonderful to look back on old family memories.", "The times we share with family should always be cherished.", "Oh no, what happened if you don't mind me asking.", "Oh man, that sucks. You can enjoy the day on your own! Forget them then.", "Oh, I love surprises like that! How exciting!", "I hope not either but it's sweet!", "You must be thrilled. What did you have?", "Is this your first?", "Oh no, I know that must make you feel bad, but you can't always be there.", "That's good. How many girls do you have?", "That sucks.  Maybe they can wait just a bit longer for you?", "We always need to make time for our families.  They are the most important thing in this world.", "Wow. Must be a really good show. What's it about?", "I love thrillers. I watched Killing Eve.", "Are you working while you are at work?", "Smart man smart man.", "Oh no, what happened to cause the cheating?", "Have you guys talked about it? Or is he still upset?", "How many do you have? Are they excited?", "What is making you so nervous?", "had they been eating too many?", "oh, that's a cute one.", "What will you do if you can't be with your wife all the time?", "Oh that makes a lot of sense now then.", "Ohhh no!  There was no one there to offer you a towel?", "Was it crowded?", "Send you self a empty package or something.", "Wow. Raccoon digging through the trash, hu?", "Are you usually afraid of raccoons or just surprised?", "Was this an unplanned trip?", "Well, I'm sorry that this was sprung upon you, but I hope you have a safe trip!", "Wow. That's a pretty low thing to do.", "Oh just a nail? You are a nice person.", "Wow! What a champ for doing that. You guys owe him!", "Get that man a wife!", "You must be so relieved that its done. ", "They are going to have so much fun with it.", "That's a really adult move on her part.", "She's showing she's responsible. I think she'll be just fine growing up.", "I wish you the best of luck on your proposal and the possibility of it becoming a reality.", "What kind of project may I ask?", "I hope you did well and congratulations on Law School!", "Law is a pretty tough career. You must've worked hard, and I'm sure that will pay off.", "Sometimes it is very hard and the jealousy can come out. I hope you have a really strong relationship though.", "I have seen many relationships be destroyed because of time and space. Good luck to you all.", "I used to be a really jealous person and was always picking a fight thinking something was up. I have learned after 21 years how to deal with my problem.", "Yes, it has been tough at times, but we have made it through. We now have 6 kids and 7 grandkids between the 2 of us.", "That sounds cool.  So you are fixing it yourself?", "Best of luck with that.  Hopefully you will do fine and save a ton of cash.", "Oh no, do you at least have food?", "Ramen is delicious! I eat them even when I'm not worrying about money.", "Whoa awesome! Really you've never been? Which one are you going too?", "Whoa! Make sure to bring money for food or bring frozen drinks. And lots of sunscreen and comfy shoes!", "I'm glad you can do what you're passionate about.  What kinds of animals do you rescue?", "That sounds so fun.  I hope I can do that some day, too!", "I can imagine. Take this time to do something for yourself.", "There you go. Sounds like fun.", "Caught by a train? Do you mean it was late?", "hahah I was kind of concerned but didn't want to ask. Glad that is the case then.", "What did he do?", "How do you cheat a little.

And maybe you can get some good ideas from hers!", "And when you do yours it will be that much newer than hers ;)", "I bet you are very eager to find out, good luck!", "Was the test hard?", "Double check your list.  Camping is always wonderful but hard to come back for something you forgot.", "Did you make a list?", "Me either. I don't want too though,lol. Are you scared?", "Oh man. Well I used to cuddle a dog when I would get scared. Find a dog", "Oh nice. What color is it?", "Interesting to see how muave works. That's a shade of purple, isn't it?", "Not for another week! And the worst part is I know I have to tell her, but how do I tell her without her freaking out, you know? I don't want her to think it was my fault.", "Thanks, I really appreciate that! We'll see how it goes. It's only been two days. Hopefully it's nothing.", "Man, that's horrible luck. Did you forget to lock it, or did they just bust in?", "Are you kidding me? The nerve of some people. How desperate do you have to be... Well, I hope you can at least replace the present so your son isn't too sad. And at least they didn't try to bust into your home and harm you.", "That's pretty lucky, did you spend it?", "Well if you do choose to spend it make sure you do it wisely!", "Lol!

She moved away. She thought I wanted her jobless boyfriend. No thanks", "Lol. He didn't even have that.", "That's what I'm talking about! That sounds so nice. I'm a little jealous. Sounds like you deserve it, though.", "That's always nice to hear. Better that then hearing someone else getting the spotlight and recognition just because they're in a higher position. I hope that keeps happening for you.", "He sounds so computer-savy.  How will you repay him?", "Dinner might be a welcomed surprise.", "The fall weather is nice, but there is so much more free time in summer.

I've been single 2 years now.", "I think I'm a little rusty in that department myself.", "Why aren't you looking forward to it?", "That's unfortunate. A week is a long time.", "I took my daughter.

You're lucky to have her, not all moms are good.", "That's good, I'm sure she enjoys seeing you happy and taken care of.", "That's pretty sweet of her. Some people would find it annoying that their parents still want to baby them, but I say you shouldn't take it for granted. They just want to be in your life.", "Well, let her know here and there how much you appreciate it. Sometimes we forget that even though we think and feel certain things, it's not always obvious to the other person. They need some verbal confirmation of appreciation!", "Eating vegetables is disgusting to me so I just blend it all in a smoothie. You should try that", "Honestly, I have no idea. But it beats eating vegetables 1 by 1 because that takes forever", "I hate that feeling. Hopefully you will feel better about it tomorrow.", "You can always start again tomorrow.", "Well at least after the storm, there will be some sunshine!", "That's where earmuffs or plugs come in handy my friend", "That is horrible luck!

Crazy how life goes.", "I'm sorry you were dissappointed.  It is hard to spend so much money on a dud movie.  Was the popcorn good at least?", "It's always good to save money, but still, it stinks.

It used to be a lot though lol", "Ive been there", "Just imagine if you found a mix tape on an actual cassette", "Are you sure it wasn't palying dead?", "Eww, what the heck! I guess you really were at a bad place at the time.", "I'm sure you will knock it out of the park. What is it on?", "That's neat - I like economics as well. Why are you so gung-ho about it?", "Why?", "Oh, then don't feel bad? I think the teacher is trying to get everyone else involved.", "You can always give them some money once you get yourself back on your feet. Just keep your head up - things will get better.", "If I ever meet you, I will toss a few bucks your way. We all have to help each other out in this tough world.", "Cool! What did you get?", "Well good for you!", "What if it true and I murder him in his sleep?", "I'll think about it.", "wow. I hope you have studied hard so you will do well. ", "Well as long as you have studied hard you should do well. Just relax knowing you have prepared yourself. ", "Oh my goodness! Did you get hurt?", "That's so sad. Did your house get damaged?", "Yeah, that bothers me to.  Don't sweat it too much though.  Just consider it their loss and move on.", "There are.  The people who ignore you are not worth your time or effort.", "You got this bro, just be confident. I believe in you", "She likes you! If she asks/talks about you then you have a much better chance too.", "That is so great! Are you in the process of applying now? I'm sure you will get in eventually.", "Perhaps. Or you just need to keep trying. Don't give up on your dreams so easily!", "That sounds interesting, is it hard to make?", "Did you really just say that hahaha. You are crazy", "That sounds like fun. But I don't think Hillbilly is a very nice way to describe people. ", "Funny, but true. Have you ever been to the races before?", "Exciting! Did you get any neat gifts?", "It's always good to have friends that know your likes. What is in your collection?", "That's always fun. Did you win any money?", "Oh darn. Better luck next time.", "That is terrible, are you okay?", "I feel super bad about that, i wish the best for you.", "I believe in you, man. I'm a bit rotund myself, but I started hitting the gym this past week.", "Yeah! By the end of the year, we'll be lifting Ford F 150's!", "For what? Are you a diver or something?", "Oh, well good luck. Have you heard of Wim Hof? He's like a world record breath holder and he does it in freezing temperatures too. ", "My dog does that too. I think it's the loud noises that scare them. ", "Lol, if only we can understand dogs and listen to what they are saying. That would be hilarious.", "Haha. These dogs that I'm dog-sitting wouldn't let that happen. They wake me up at 6:30AM every morning to feed them. But hey, we make mistakes. Maybe you had a busy day today.", "Ah, hate's a strong word. They're smarter than we give them credit for. They know you always feed them. At the end of the day, I doubt she could have a much better owner", "What is a aardvark?", "I thought so. The name alone sounds so exotic, were you mad that you had to clean pooop?", "You usually don't get that much jail time for drunk driving if it is your first incident. It shouldn't be so bad, but hopefully it will make you more cautious in the future.", "Oh wow. I really hope that you get the help you need. I can relate though...I used to be reckless like that a couple years back. Just have to be responsible and arrange an uber or some other form of transportation.", "Oh, I am so sorry to hear that. Did you get her something nice?", "That was very thoughtful, something to keep her entertained when she wasn't feeling well. Is she doing better?", "That's gross.", "Thanks for that information.", "I did a little painting. I don't build things.", "Treat them well and they will.", "Nice! Did you manage to snag the promotion?", "It's good to work hard for that dough. What's your new billet entail?", "Oh my goodness! I bet that was embarrassing. But it happens.

Why do they have to cost so much?", "How did that experience go?", "I'm very glad, and I understand how the memories are.", "I would too.  What had happened?", "Yes.  Did they admit fault?", "How old are your kids?", "Are you worried they are going to be abducted or something?", "What can you lose?", "You do. I mean it can only go one of two ways. And if it goes one way, you can try again with another girl.", "They going to have sore bottoms soon. I can't stand it.", "They will wish they got more sleep when they are older. Just like me now.", "That happened to me too when I was in elementary school. I lost all my friends and had to make new ones, which sucks.", "I agree.", "I bet she felt really special!", "I can relate to that!", "Me too. I miss payments sometimes because I forget about them and I'm lazy.", "That's my exact situation too.", "Ah, so you're in the same boat as me? I can understand how that goes. Electricity is so necessary nowadays, too.", "I'm with you. Sometimes responsibilities get too overwhelming and you feel like you have to hide from them. At some point though, I'm sure you and I will improve.", "I know. I can't make it a whole day though.", "I keep trying. I might need to try medication.", "I like dogs", "How many do you have?", "I wish. That was my first thought, but I just can't make it work, time-wise. I major in social work, and an internship is mandatory, and that's a part-time job in itself.", "I really don't want to. But I might have to. I'm scared of going into even more debt, since I already have student loans. We'll see what my options are after I talk to my family.", "Yankees fan, huh? I should pit you against my brother. He loves the Red Sox. I bet you guys would argue for a while.", "Haha, he'd probably say the same thing to you. He's been a fan of them for about 20 years. What about you? How long have you followed them?", "34. It was really sad. She had 4 children.", "5-14", "IT;s sad but I think so too.", "Congratulations. We don't share the same sentiment.", "Have you asked him how he feels about that entire situation?", "Life is a scary place, anything could happen at any time.", "Really? That's one of the saddest things I've heard in a while. I'm sorry to hear that. What happened to your family, if you don't mind me asking?", "I am terribly sorry to hear that. You've got to be really resilient to deal with that. Maybe you could volunteer at a soup kitchen during Thanksgiving so you could have a chance to be around others?", "Did you do anything after she did it?", "I have never had siblings, so not sure what to tell ya.", "Why's that? Did you specifically have a bad experience with them, or just assume they're terrible no matter what?", "Trapped in a cave? I couldn't handle that. I'm claustrophobic. I'd freak out in a second. How long were you trapped for?", "Some people are just cruel.", "You should have called the police. If they were just vandals they probably did it to someone else to.", "He's three and he has his on that's why I keep mines locked. I am so mad at him.", "ME too. I'm gonna have to hide it now.", "Did you practice first in a parking lot?", "Did you use GPS?", "I can understand that.

I'm just embarrassed", "I am totally with you", "I am sure you could", "How old is he?", "Wow, you can teach an old dog new tricks.", "Indeed. It would be fun to see your friends again and be around them", "I think being with children is a joy that not everybody can understand", "How much is the phone?", "Will you be able to pay that off quick thou?", "Oh no. Did it ever come back?", "That sucks. MY sisters dog used to roam the neighborhood a lot and one day he didn't come back either. His name was Oreo. I told my daughter he got married.", "Gatlinburg and Panama City Beach, Then I took an adult trip to New Orleans. Great summer.", "It was a lot of fun. Smelled funny though lol", "Awwww  i can relate to that.  I am so sorry.", "I am very sorry to hear that", "Who was it?", "That was nice of them.", "I'm not too fond of winter, but what kind of coat did you buy?", "Awesome, I bet it's comfy! How cold does it get where you live?", "In about three weeks from now. I almost don't know how to feel about it, though.", "I hope so! I'm a little worried that he will cry at first.", "You may have more than you know but sometimes meeting new people will give you the fresh start you need", "Neighbors, co-workers.  Try and get involved in local sports or comunity groups.  How about volunteering.  That is a good way to meet people that are positive", "Where did they come from?", "Where did they go?", "I'm not particularly a fan of subways either, but why are you so scared of being robbed?", "I think the overall chances of that are pretty low. Though I do understand your fear.", "So I take it you get along well with your boss?", "That's great to hear, often times we here of people who hate their bosses!", "No, it's completely shattered. I'm pretty upset. ", "Thanks. I guess I need to just cherish her memory and try not to put too much emotion into material things.", "I have some scrapes on my hands where I landed. But mostly it was just my pride that was injured. I hope I never see that person around the neighborhood again...", "Probably. And you're right, yeah, I'm overthinking it. But I keep replaying it over and over in my head! I'm sure after another day or two it'll be gone.", "I'm sorry to hear that. Why do you think that is? Is it a painful or happy memory?", "I can understand that. That does sound like a difficult thing to deal with. Hopefully you have a lot of nice memories you can look back on to remember her by.", "It is these delicate balance of our natural body that makes us to be diligent for survival", "Indeed. Nature is very interesting and complex to interpret. Survival is the only mechanism that drive us to have certain physical features", "I bet that was a nice surprise! That's pretty cool. What was it for, if you don't mind me asking?", "That's really cool... And also way above my head! But seriously, that sounds like smart, hard work. You should be proud. I'm glad you got that \"moment in the sun.\"", "Wow, that's amazing! Shows that we can't judge a book by it's cover. We automatically think it would take a large man to do something like that!", "I would have been unable to move for the rest of the day!", "Oh yeah, knowing that they left for positive reasons and having social media to keep in contact helps a lot.", "How come you guys don't use social media? I guess I kind of get it, but I feel in your case it could be a huge positive!", "Well that's good. Skype is actually even better than having to deal with all the extra nastiness of social media.", "Was it for school?", "Did you get fired due to it?", "That is a little daunting.  Have you considered joining some groups with like-minded individuals?", "Check with your community center", "Aww! How sweet! I can imagine the first few days are crazy.", "I do not have any kids. Honestly too scared for child birth haha", "Aw, that is fantastic! How did yall meet?", "Wow, you guys meet pretty early on. That's nice that you pretty much grew together as you became adults.", "Hopefully a happy birthday is going to be in order soon!", "Happy early birthday then.  Drink up!", "I don't know, but I even have pictures of my cat and some Funko Pops at that desk, and the one next to me is never used.", "No way, he already has two wives (seriously), and he's definitely not into guys.", "Yes, they can be fun I guess.", "Yes that could be very annoying.", "That is so sad. Did the kitten die? I hope not.", "Oh, I hope it was ok. I understand you not being able to stop.", "I use these new wireless cameras that need to be taken down and charged every so often. I should have charged it while I was home!", "Yeah, I'm really pissed. I guess I should be mad at myself too, it doesn't make sense to charge it when you need it!", "Oh wow, what luck! I bet you slowed down after that!", "Well that's good that you use this as a reason to stop speeding. Some people never learn!", "I love Colorado.", "Did you have fun?", "It is. Now we have to deal with rains and snows. So much to go for the next summer", "I think climate change will only exacerbate the freezing temperatures during winter season", "Why did you decide not to go?", "Did you make it to the game at least?", "What is the big end goal?", "I think you can do it.", "That's not good. What's wrong?", "Oh man, that would make me angry! Is there anyone you can call and report them anonymously?", "Maybe you can sneak over and steal them?", "He's perfectly find, but man was it gross!

I personally try to avoid too much nostalgia. Others seem to love it.", "Oh yes! He never lost motivation through the entire process.", "It's really not as hard as it seems. All you have to do is cut your calories down a bit, you don't even need to change the foods you eat!", "Wow, I have never been! What all did you see?", "Oh cool. What was you favorite thing at the square? ", "A part in what?", "What play is it?", "That is rough news.  How long?", "That is hard.

How do you feel about that?", "That's very good, do you feel content at the moment?", "Did you spill something on it?", "Did you hurt yourself?", "Are you excited about it?", "I hope you have a great time!", "Maybe you should take a different class.", "You will have to study harder then.", "Especially getting gifts from family.

I guess you'll have to find a nicer game.", "Oh, that's curious... By different, what do you mean? Did you buy different stuff, or go to a different store, or what?", "Oh yeah, totally. And then you don't end up buying too much or too little, and you don't waste time trying to remember things. There's also tons of little apps on your phone you can get that can make it really streamlined and convenient.", "I'm sorry to hear that.

I still eat them today", "Don't get me started. I ate a Toaster Strudel every morning lol", "Have kids so you can say you're buying those snacks for them. That's what I did lol", "Wide open? Or just unlocked? That's crazy! I guess you got lucky you didn't get robbed or have some animals become new roommates.

Too bad they won't get help for the kids", "You would think they would be motivated to keep their kids", "That is so disappointing. Will you stay there?", "That's too bad.

Do you know what caused it?", "Eww.. Rotten eggs.. That's terrible.

Sometimes kids don't know how to interact well with each other. But it's an important part of the socializing part of life that they work their way through it. All you can do is tell them how to respectfully and appropriately respond and defend themselves.", "Ah.. so it's that kind of situation. Yeah, it can be one thing if it's just something where kids are acting like kids, and you can't physically intervene in time.

I live in a city with a very extensive history that is utilized a lot in \"haunted\" trips and stuff like that, so I have seen them around and have wondered about going on one. Do you believe in ghosts?", "Yeah, I can totally understand that. It can be exhilarating and a different experience, I would imagine. But I would understand that you wouldn't want to have to deal with the after effects. I never have trouble with nightmares, so I don't worry about that. As for me, I'm still on the fence about ghosts.", "That's really too bad. I know how that feels. Have you tried telling her how you feel about it?", "That must be really difficult and lonely for you. I hope you guys can get something figured out.", "Sounds like a good kid. What has he been working on.", "That's great! How old is he?", "That is nice of you.  Where has he been?", "that is really nice of you", "Sometimes you gotta stand up for yourself.", "If they know you, they should know better.", "Talk about an unwelcome guest! I would have immediately slammed my door shut! I never know how to respond in those situations, as in whether or not they're dangerous, etc. What did you do?", "I did not expect that kind of reaction! But I guess I don't know enough about possums. Maybe that makes sense. I compare them almost to raccoons, who I've seen be very aggressive. Well, it looks you made a new friend. I hope you named them!", "You are so lucky!", "I know exactly what you mean. Someone returned my purse at the casino once. It still had my money in it!", "Its been ten years and it doesnt even show up half of the time. I told the judge the last time I don't even want it anymore.", "I hope so. They deseve the best and I plan to give it to them", "Don't be too hard on yourself. You taught yourself a lesson for next time.", "I'm in college I understand. Just have to keep pushing forward and you'll so great", "Oh no.  I have experienced that before and its not pleasant.  Its hard to be kind and careful with your speech and actions when you're near a snob.", "Seriously!  I just keep thinking that they are a person just like me and it doesn't always means they are better than me just because they are entitled.  As they say, everyone puts their pants on one leg at a time.", "Ugh! So you have corrupt police officers in your town too? That is a bummer!", "I would too! Most officers dont show up for that.", "Your mom is awesome", "Maybe you should go on a trip together", "Two girls and one boy.  I want them to live with me forever. Their kids too lol", "Time will tell. I think they are pretty cool though.", "Why is that?", "I can understand that", "I hops so too! Work does come first or the bills can't be paid! :)", "What kind of birthday are you having?", "Wow! Enjoy it! What did you accomplish if I may ask?", "That is something that is a dream! Enjoy it so much! congrats", "It depends on what they do in therapy. I cannot live with them they way they have been so it's a pickle.", "<3 Thank you! Truly!", "There's absolutely nothing I can say to make you feel better about that. I'm sorry for your great losses. Just from those few sentences alone, I can tell you were very passionate about them. What were their names, if you don't mind me asking?", "Those are great names! And that does sound like a good idea, as long as you're comfortable with it. It's such a tenuous situation.. to want another pet to fill the void, but to be scared that you will be disappointed when they don't live up to their predecessors. My girlfriend will be in the same situation when her dog passes. She's already getting nervous since her dog is 10-years-old.", "Oh gross!  I've heard of flies or ants being in an ear, but a roach?  That gives me chills because I hate roaches sooooo much.  Now I might have nightmares tonight!", "EW!  I might start sleeping with ear plugs in now too.  I've heard you eat 8 spiders on average in a lifetime, some in your sleep.  So many things to be scared of with bugs! I'm so glad they were able to get it out.  Tell her I hope she gets over the trauma of it okay.", "I filled the cart, got to the register. and I had left my purse at home", "It was sych a waste if time", "That is terrible", "Police here do that sometimes. It sucks.", "Wow really? I have before and now I am again. It's hard! You wake up and think..what is going on, where am I..Oh yeah!", "The past 2 weeks. It's a change. better then abuse though", "That is great! Being without a job can be very scary", "What kind of job is it?", "Yu should report him", "Well thats what I mean. I hate when people take advantage of others", "Oh that could be tough sometimes. I'm glad you were able to get all the ones you wanted.", "It's all behind you now.", "My neighbors are terrible so I hope you have a good relationship", "I actually had some move in a couple of days ago. I have figured them out yet lol", "I guess you're right lol", "Not at all lol", "That happens over time", "I wonder what my old school looks like now", "Oh no, what happened?", "You should check if they raised your rates unexpectedly or maybe something you bought is eating up a lot of electricity.", "That's terrible, what did you do?", "I hope he learned his lesson.", "I thought it was pretty good, not the greatest but good enough.", "I had the Pasta Puttanesca.", "yes! Yin and yang, it's hard to appreciate the quiet without the loud :)", "Remember to cherish them as we can all go at any minute :)", "I'm going with a Hoover. Yes I love things clean!  I haven't bought a new vacuum in years. It's long overdue.", "I hear you! But some of us like a good machine. Personally I like Kirbys best and the old kind from Ebay etc. They work better then anything. Sharks work pretty good too. I guess we gals might think of cleaning tools like cars lol", "Woah! I'm soooo glad you're okay!  Those big rigs are so dangerous and make me so nervous.  I stay as far away from them as I can.", "Well, that's understandable.  I've had two kids of my own and labor would not be fun in the car.  Was she in shock when you guys were almost hit?", "I completely understand that.  Things are always scary when it is happening to your kids, but there is hope!  Have you ever heard of whole foods plant based diet?  Or doctor Fuhrman, or doctor Michael Greger?  I think it could heal your son!", "You will likely never hear about any of this stuff in a doctors office, but it can heal almost anything!  I hope your son is better before the end of summer.  Keep hope alive!", "What happened to it?", "That sucks.", "What are they doing?", "Oh lol, Well it", "Sorry! I meant that kids do that, enjoy it mom while they are little :)", "I feel sorr for the poor guy!", "Yea, they're his parents. I can imagine everyone being hesitant about telling them what not to do with their own child.", "That's nice of you to say about someone else. It's nice when someone can recognize someone else's hard work and dedication without feeling jealous or annoyed. I'm sure he knows how proud of him you are.", "That's a good way to look at it, to use them as motivation and a goal to strive for. Are you in school yourself, or just working?", "Oops.  That's doesn't have to be a bad thing.  No one can resist fries from McDonalds.  How did she react?", "Well, there you go.  She enjoyed it and if she didn't complain or scoff at you, then she sounds like a keeper!", "You must really miss him! So glad you'll finally be reunited with him.", "Oh you have kids, too? They're going to be so happy!", "I've never done that before.", "I bet its fun. I cant swim though", "I have know idea and I'm scared to watch it.", "She knows I dont like scary movies. Im goin to though. Well I will try lol", "Something that helps kids with clothing and other essentials for school. ", "Hopefully we can get it going.", "Oh no. That has happened to us so many times. I thought fidh were easy", "Wow. Im sorry", "People can be inconsiderate sometimes. I hope you don't get sick!", "That's true. It's nice of you to put yourself in their shoes.", "Oh man, Costco pizza is great, and so cheap, too. It may not be the best, but for the price and quantity, you can't really beat it. Do you like shopping at Costco often?", "Yeah, I guess it depends on your household. I just tag along with my parents from time to time to get certain things in bulk. But I think you need to have a certain amount of people in your family for it to be worth the membership. Still, I really appreciate the business and the owner as a whole.", "I was fine until she brought it back with no gas and left trash allover the seat. I couldnt believe it", "I know. She lost that privilege", "That is terrible. Some people ar just no good.", "I hate that happened to you. I know the feeling too. Someone stole my car from the work parking lot once. I had just soent over 1500 getting things fixed on it.", "Family conflict is always hard.  Maybe you don't need to take a side and try to work for peace.", "It is rarely easy to know the right thing to do in these sorts of situations.  This might be a situation that calls for some professional help.", "Whoa! Was that a good surprise, or a bad surprise? I could see that going either way, but at least it would be exciting! I had that happen when I got one for Christmas. Well, actually it was in my parent's bed, and I barged into their room to ask if we could go downstairs and open presents, and I saw the one they had gotten me and had been hiding to surprise me with.", "That's pretty cool! I hope everything goes well with the training and raising of it. Your wife sounds really cool to do that for you.", "Did you call her? I hope she's ok!", "I'm glad you're going to talk about it instead of being passive aggressive about it.", "Oh, that's kind of nice. It's nice to have those natural landmarks near where you live, so you can visit them and get a sense of relaxation and peace. I've lived near the ocean all my life, and while I do take it for granted from time to time, I try to remember how useful and beautiful it is.", "Sometimes it means increased work commute, or higher costs of living. But sometimes that can be worth it in terms of the health benefits and lifestyle improvements that come along with it. It's all a balance. I'm glad you seem to have found yours!", "that is awesome! ", "It will save you a lot of money too", "Oh nice. What will you be binge watching?", "Hope you find something you like.", "She will do great. OR she might not want to have kids be he is such a handful", "Lids today are so picky about everything. Its sort of strange. Its nothing like when I was growing up", "I have to get a baysitter and spend moen just to prepare to go out. Its so inconsiderate. I think I need new friends.", "That's really good advice. I can have a better time with other peopl.", "Wow, that sounds exciting!", "I love a good rock concert!", "Oh god. Someone did pick up their dog's poop, hu?", "It must've been. I hope that never happens to you again.", "I bet it did.", "Not too many of those around nowadays", "oh that was good of you.", "oh haha i know that feeling.", "thats a good idea.", "Thats a bummer", "Whos concert?", "Nice. Are you excited?", "I hope it's what you expected to be!", "That is so sweet of your cat.", "Well, I hope you get better soon.", "Oh sweet. Sin city! What do you look forward to doing?", "Oh yea.

Anything in particular?", "Cthat sounds amazing!", "Oh god that's terrifying haha. I hate snakes.", "I know what you mean, they are cool to look at but if they are near me it spooks me hard.", "That's tough. I have two older brothers, so I know how that is. We're separated by four and eight years, respectively, so we weren't as close as you two seem to be, but I always liked having them around.", "Well, absence always does make the heart grow fonder. It will make your relationship a little strained, but the time you guys do get to spend together maybe will mean more and you can enjoy it more. Hopefully his college work doesn't stress him out too much for him to be able to enjoy hanging out.", "Your husband sounds awesome. That's interesting that you're the type of person that actually likes birthday parties. Most people I know would be too embarrassed or self-conscious to enjoy them, and they'd feel uncomfortable. Especially me. But for you, I'm glad you can get into them. ", "Oh, I didn't mean anything about the age! Who cares about that. I'm just a doofus when it comes to social interaction, so I get nervous and avoid things that put attention on me. But I hope you have a lot of fun, especially since your husband went through so much effort. I bet he knows you and what you like well and it will be great.", "Oh no!  My gut feels sick for you having to go through that.  It happens to all of us but its so painful and awkward.  How did the neighbors take it?", "Its so commendable that you went over and told them right away.  Not everyone would do that.  Your actions increases my faith in the goodness of people.", "That is cool.  When did you learn?", "That is awesome", "Oh that's rare. How come?", "Oh now I see lol. Who's your favorite team?", "Oh wow, that's nice of you! What kind?", "I love BMWs. They must've been so happy!", "I'm so sorry.

What's happening this weekend?", "That's awesome. How long are you guys going to be there?", "That sucks. Did you get a raincheck on your birthday though?", "I'm glad they did that for you. So it wasn't all that bad having to work on your birthday then.", "Uh oh. Was someone in there?", "Oh wow! That is kind of scary.", "That's good to have land you own.", "Privacy is so important to have sometimes.", "That isn't cool.  Is there anyone else that sells it?", "That is good", "That's great.

What type of memories?", "music brings back lots of memories", "I assume on purpose", "No clue, I walked out side this morning and found it broken.", "That's disgusting.  Makes me wonder what their kitchen looks like.", "I'd atleast leave a review about it.", "Oh, that's crappy. Is it totaled or fixable? ", "Not how you want to spend your Sunday, that's for sure!", "That sounds like you should get the job for sure! Your competition doesn't stand a chance!! :)", "Well, I hope the job is close to where you live. Long commutes are the worst, and they can take away from your personal time.", "Oh, I am so sorry this happened to you. What an animal! When will you know the results of your tests?", "Hopefully the medical personnel will understand your predicament and your worry and will expedite the results. Until then, do you have someone you can confide in or just talk to?", "That sounds exciting. How long has it been since you've seen eachother?", "That's great!", "That must be very exciting! I hope to get a new vehicle soon as well.", "Yeah, sometimes it's good to get brand new if you can afford it! Buying old runs the risk of it breaking more.", "oh, that's okay. I'm sure no one else really noticed it.", "That's okay. You gave him a good story to tell. ", "some grew very big others didn't do so well", "probably next year. it's too late in the season to retry this year.", "oh no. that can be nerve wracking. are you alright?", "that's happened to me before and it really shakes you. at least you are alright which is the important part.", "Yeah I heard that before. You must have a twin running around here!", "When I was young we had tintypes. You had to stay still for 45 minutes for your picture to be taken. I don't miss the ol' days!", "Hahahah, that is hilarious. I used to do that but with coins and stuff. I miss being a little ruthless, careless kid!", "I bet she was so confused lol", "If I were you I would accept it because no amount of stress could stop me from making more money.", "If you accept it you can enjoy taking a nice vacation that you otherwise wouldn't be able to afford.", "Oh, that's never fun. You think you're going to discover a new favorite and then....blech!", "The old ways are the best ways sometimes. ", "I hope you didn't lose too much money!", "Oh wow, that's very nice of her. A lot of people would have just stolen it.", "That is a good attitude. You shouldn't have anything to worry about.", "Yeah sometimes doctors will notice something before it gets worse. Better to be safe than sorry!", "Yes I am terrified!  We have venemous ones in my backyard - water moccs!", "Oh my!  That's so scary!  Glad you're ok!!", "What a mean friend person. Did you get mad?", "That could have been you..", "Maybe..", "Have you thought about speaking with a counselor?", "Well, you should know that your feelings are a normal thing to happen in this event.", "You would have been mad at me this morning!", "Nope, I drank it all to myself!", "What type of work are they doing at school?", "Ah, I see. Well, it's been a lot longer since I did calculus. Good on you, remembering that stuff!", "Oh my god, I am so sorry to hear that!", "Please try to stay positive. Having a positive attitude can do great things for recovery! Many people have survived cancer!", "I love that feeling of nostalgia. It's an amazing feeling, it's like reliving the past.", "I agree. Time flies by so fast!", "A few years now. I can't believe how trusting she is of me to let me borrow her car for a few days. I owe her a lot!", "No, I just needed a car for some errand this weekend and she kindly let me borrow it. She is great!", "It's been mediocre, how about you?", "Remember we are role-playing! Don't talk about this or any tasks! :)", "Did the dream feel like it was really happening? Strange indeed.", "Hah! So all that time you were just feeling your dog licking you! Weird how that works.", "Oops. Well it happens. You better hope they don't have a camera haha.", "Don't worry. They will probably run over your mailbox one day and hope you don't have a camera.", "Wow wow wow! That is wonderful and exciting! Congratulations!!!!! Do you have any vibes as to gender, one way or the other?", "So wonderful, either way. Are y'all having a party?", "For sure!  I went there a lot as a kid, because my grandparents lived right near Anaheim.", "Yes, we had fun.  Disneyland is the on in California and \"world\" is the one in Florida.  ", "I think so. I am feel so guilty because the interest was so avoidable. I forget so many things all the time...", "You might be right, I'll look into this. Thank you.", "I am so proud, she is 50 and it's her first degree.", "I think we're going to have a grad party on the weekend.", "What kind of doctor is she going to be?", "That is impressive, where is she having her wedding?!", "I would suggest Fiji it's so nice there I went in august!", "I know but I wasn't expecting it.. and it looked like my mom.", "I was afraid she would start yelling at me LOL", "Lol, I bet you were disgusted with yourself", "Aw, don't take it too serious though. Everyone pukes in public at least once in their life!", "I actually just discovered Imagine Dragons. I love them!", "It's good to hear they were good live, that can't be said about every group.", "Wow, you are a true friend. What did you do to help them?", "Everyone could use a friend like you.

Welldone buddy, enjoy your winning", "It was really strong I think many people died.", "Yes I feel awful for people in such tragedies particularly those that lose loved ones.", "Argh! That is the worst. I am so sorry. Is it enough to inspire you to look for work elsewhere?", "If he's done that to you, he's doing it to others -- that kind of behavior isn't sustainable. Others are *bound* to notice at some point -- but I know waiting for that is frustrating!", "Oh dear. Well, that does happen. Did you have any other clothes to change into?", "If your workplace is anything like mine, you'd have heard plenty by now. I've done something similar, but could call my husband to sneak in some clean clothes - they are useful now and again!", "Good for you, I would wait until I heard back before I would celebrate getting the job. ", "There is so much competition for jobs  ", "That's extremely unsettling. How did you feel when you saw the photo with that in it for the first time?", "Did you feel any kind of \"presence\" or anything in the moment that you were at the site taking the picture?", "That's okay. We all make mistakes. Thanks for the good conversation.", "Not the worst part is that cashier insisted I had given her $10 when I was sure it was $20.", "I had to speak to the manger to get my money back.", "I did and he gave me my money but nothing else.", "Why is that so?", "Maybe you could work night shift too and that way you will be able to spend more time together.", "You could also got out foe a while and do something fun.", "What happened from your clumsiness?", "I remember when that happened on the Spiderman movie. Did she laugh at you?", "Wow, that's exciting! Congratulations, you must be very proud. ", "I would love to go their! I hope you have a great time!", "That's nice. Did you have a party?", "That's excellent. What was your favorite present?", "Gee, that's no fun. I hope it wasn't too early? There are usually laws about making noise early in the morning.", "Yes, that's a good idea. I think 7am is way too early for that.", "Wow that sounds awesome.  I always wanted to be able to do that, but I was never any good", "Maybe one day you will be able to work you way up to being the next Tony Hawk.", "I have four dogs.  I am probably guilty of this crime.  I would just throw it back over.", "One time this lady 1 house away scooped up all the cat poo from my cat under her window into a bag and put it on my front door with a note.  I thought... why did she clean it up for me?  Wouldn't it have been more affective to ask me to clean it up?  ", "That sounds so wonderful.  I am having a similarly relaxing day too.", "Oh my!", "It's in the fall and yes, I absolutely will!", "He may just work for a few years before he decides. ", "Oh no! did you hurt yourself?", "How did the dirtbike hold up? And how old are you?!", "Oh dear, sounds like a serious accident. I'm glad you are okay! Could have been terrible. ", "I'm glad you're okay- that must have been scary. ", "Yes, ducks are so cute.", "The bill that they quack from.", "Yeah? I'd be happy to help. But say something about what exactly?", "Hm.. yeah that is a dilemma. I mean if you can afford it, the honest thing would be to go and offer the manager to pay it back.", "Wow, some people are horrible drivers.  Did you honk at him?", "At least you didn't get into an accident.  I guess it could have been a lot worse.", "I think you will be fine. Don't feel too anxious worrying won't do anything", "prayer works for me. I hope it does for you too so that person you just talked about won't get the job", "Really sorry to be slow to respond.  How old are your girls?!", "Wow!  That's amazing.  It must be so awesome that they have each other to hang out and have fun with.  ", "What type of dog do you have?", "I have never in my life heard of that breed before.  I'll look it up.  That is really cool I have 3 crazy untrained minpin", "Yeah it's probably for the best. You don't want to risk rejection. Maybe they will approach you.", "Well there is no 'I' in hope. It is a something we all have to do at some point in life.", "Oh, I know for sure. There are no rules to follow. ", "Ugh. Maybe you can wait out that relationshio.", "Well that is very lucky for you. People are nice!", "Yes there are. Most of the people are very nice.", "Oh no! How did that happen? ", "Gee, I hope you can find it. Maybe retract where you have been recently and you will find it!", "Hey, that's awesome! I'm happy for you. Where did they find it?", "That's great. I hope you have a good workout at the gym!", "Well that is very nice of you.

All expenses paid.", "That is so cool!  Is it your first baby?", "I bet.  If he is anything like you he will grow up to be a great person.", "Most people are pretty cool if you take the time to talk to them a bit. ", "Wow, that's so cool. Sign me up for that! I'd like to be healed!", "We did go. It was for my 40th birthday a few years ago. ", "Well, I went to Ireland in July, so I think I should stay home and save some money! Do you like to travel?", "Wow that's so exciting! What did they study?", "That is great. What's the next step- work?", "Good for you. Being prepared is half the work of academia. ", "It's hard to do, but so important. I'm not super smart, but I'm organized as heck. It makes a difference. ", "There is nothing silly about that.  Movies are meant to illicit emotion.  You feel better now though, right?", "Definitely don't feel bad then.  I think everyone cried during that movie!", "Oh my gosh. Im so sorry to hear that.  My thoughts and prayers are with your family", "Dang, there's a lot of strategies to fight that thought, I'm assuming. As they say an ounce of preparation is worth more than a pound of cure", "Yeah, I heard it's good to study in silence because that way you're in the same environment you'll be when you take the test", "Yeah that's too bad, sorry to hear that. Do you know why you didn't get picked?", "Keep your head up. Maybe you'll get picked the next time around.", "Oh no!  I am so sorry to hear that.  Did he die of old age?", "Well, hopefully he lived a good and happy life.  ", "Yeah, he was being really uncooperative and seemed to not care about other people's time.", "I feel the same way, a couple of my other roommates agreed and I think he learned.", "oh now, that's very worrisome", "I hope it's nothing serious. I know how upsetting having a sick pet can be. ", "Oh no! Did you eventually get it working after the frustration?", "That's frustrating, nothing ever seems to go right the first time you try it! Glad you got it working finally!", "Dang, maybe you should have bought a lottery ticket instead?", "Maybe you can find a cheaper place to live?", "Yeah! Did you pick your lucky numbers?", "Nice! I hope you win!", "That is so satisfying. I hope they don't mess it up now that they are home!", "NOOOOOOOO!!!! Bad kids! That must have been infuriating.

What are you going to see on your trip?", "I'm so jealous! I hope you have a great trip!", "You did! - That's amazing! How much money did you win???", "Wow- that's a huge amount of money! What do you plan on doing with it?", "That is absolutely wonderful! What a great grandchild you are. Not everyone wants to care for elderly relatives.", "For sure. We sometimes forget that the elderly were young once and did so much like working, raising and caring for their families.", "Do you play soccer yourself? ", "It is impressive. ", "Congratulations to your brother! Are you flying or driving?", "Wow, that must be quite some distance then! Have a safe flight!", "That's great to hear. Summer is a good time of year to be enjoying your life.", "I've been thinking a lot about when I was a kid recently.", "Yeah, my mom had told me multiple time to not run in the basement. Next thing I know, I tripped on a lamp cord making the lamp fall and break into pieces.", "No, she was glad I didn't get hurt. But months later I ended up with glass from that lamp in my foot.", "yes thankfully i was able to get in the house without rain falling on me", "yeah except i had to walk thru the rain puddles to make it into the house so my shoes and the bottom of my pants got wet.", "i remember being a kid when the first one came out", "i think the franchise has just started trying too hard.", "Those are good preventative measures. I assume that you always look both ways as well?", "There are worse things to be worried about. Good job on you for taking safety seriously!", "I think she will.  I hope she will.  I feel betrayed.", "THank you.. I appreciate it!  I wish everyone was nice like you.", "Thats so nice of you!  I wish I had a grandmother.", "So nice of you.  You are truly blessed to have family.", "Long distance relationships aren't easy. That's great news to hear. Do you have anything special planned?", "That sounds like so much fun! I bet you two will have a great time together. ", "I took three bites into the sandwich, and about half way as I pulled back from the sandwich was a hair connected from my mouth being pulled out of the food. I've never experienced something like that from fast food.", "Haha, I like that you looked on the brightside of that situation at least?", "bug spray doesn't do anything for me.", "we have bats like crazy here. i wish they would eat up all the mosquitos.", "i am also blessed. we don't have fancy things or a ton of money but we have each other and our health.", "me too. some are not as fortunate as us.", "Oh, jeez! That's terrifying. Can you get a loan from someone to pay them?", "Call the police! Or move. ", "I like a good hard bread like Pumpernickel. Do you know what that word means?", "It means the devil's fart, haha! Good bread though.", "Did the batter hit one of the home runs?", "Whoa! That is so cool! I guessed because you said the crack sound happened.", "Whoa, that's extreme. Can you say some prayers for them? ", "Yes good point. Maybe try and understand why they believe in the things they do?", "Don't worry bout that.  She has to have some sort of fantasy in her life.  Don't you have any ever?", "Well know that it isn't any different from you checking out other girls too.", "That is so exciting. Have you been a fan a long time?", "That is something to look forward to!", "how did it go?", "congrats! that is amazing news.", "i try to go once a year but money is tight right now.", "i don't know if i could possibly make more than i am currently", "Ohh, I love Halloween!

I know exactly what you are talking about!", "well did you ? the most i ever won was like 20 bux lol", "well im confident one day you will win in life something great in life , better than money ", "Is there any warnings? How much rain are you expecting?", "That is very scary. We have had a lot of rain here and when that happens large trees often come down.", "What was your hamster's name?", "Do you know what it was that happened to kill him?", "I hope that does good things for you. They say if you believe in something enough it comes true.", "I can't say it has worked for me though. I have believed myself a ruler of the world but still live in this box.", "it did. i wish it wasn't $40.00 for the set or i would've bought it.", "it was an antique shop so i doubt it.", "That sounds delightful. I have a tornado approaching now and would like it if you lived near me.", "What is your address?", "Oh no, I hope you are ready for it?", "Yeah, I hope you won't either.

But my beautiful new car..", "I didn't have any insurance", "So did you find out that they were lying?", "That's funny. Maybe you got the name wrong or something?", "Yes that is a great one. I will put your ideas onto my list. I will be better prepared for the next storm!", "Thank you!", "What a day, huh?! Can you tell me what happened or is it still too raw?", "That is not something I would want to come home to seeing. And your day at work was bad too, wow!", "Aww, that's a bummer. Well at least you can look forward to his visits.", "Depending how far away he is, he probably will! Just make sure to spoil him when he does lol!", "Sometimes it's hard to find that certain someone!

But there is more..", "Exactly, that is what I heard from my older and more trusted friend!", "So, I\u2019m just sitting here and I got a text out of the blue from my ex, telling me that she still loved me.

LOL", "Oh I'm sorry to hear that, were you thinking of buying another one?", "Well I'm glad you have good memories to remember him by.", "Oh yeah? What specifically did it remind you of?", "That was a good time for me as well. I liked to hang out with my friends and get in trouble.", "That's great! What made you feel rewarded?", "Oh yeah I could see how that might make you feel that way. Is the employee grateful for your help?", "That's gross. What was it??", "I would have thrown up!

Glad you rescued the pup!", "that's awesome! what rooms did you remodel?", "Oh i bet it looks great!

That's awesome. It's nice to have something of value.", "That's really hard!  I'm sure that was disappointing after putting in so many years.  Sorry.", "Wow.  Well, if that was the culture and climate of that workplace, you are definitely better off not working for them.  Very sad.", "I was going to Georgia to watch my cousin's son play in his first college football game.  It was going to be a nice family reunion type trip.", "Yes, that's a great idea.  I might be better later in the season when he's used to everything.  I have to look on the bright side...right?!!!", "What was the reason that happen to you?", "I hope you you work behind a desk.

What was the game?", "Ah, I suppose I could have guessed. It's the game everyone is talking about lately. I heard it's quite good!", "I totally know the feeling! Have you tried bringing this up to your supervisor?", "Ha, that would be some pretty good revenge. Maybe you should go ahead and find a new job where you will be appreciated.", "That's disgusting, I would have a very hard time finishing that walk. Did you go straight home?", "Oh my gosh, that makes it so much worse! I have done that before too, so I hope that neither one of us has that happen again!!", "What happened?", "OMG, those things make the hair on the back of my neck stand up. Hopefully it didn't get into your house.", "That's at MGM right?  My daughter rode that with her daddy when she was 8, she was terrified!  Did you do it again, or was once enough?", "That is what I hate about any amusement park ride - the drops!", "That's amazing! What other animals did you see?", "I bet they were seriously cute! Did you get to feed them?", "That's pretty impressive! Was it scary to move away from home at such a young age?", "I'll bet it was! I don't have family around, so I know how lonely that can feel!", "I absolutely hate car trouble! It is the worst!  Thankful for friends that can help out in times like that - did you get it fixed?", "That's a good friend for sure - I'd keep their number on speed dial!  ", "Oh no, I hope she is OK! Glad you are taking her to the vet. Is she doing OK other than the lumps?", "Aww, poor girl. Hopefully the vet can figure it out and it isn't anything too serious. You're doing the right thing.", "I think that it's completely normal to feel that way for such a long distance trip. I assume you're going from America. I bet you would feel better by doing a bit of research!", "I think those are just outliers, you'll find that there are plenty of well established tourist areas that will accommodate you well. Just don't focus on the negatives!", "That would drive me crazy.  How are you handling it?", "You can't let it get you too down.  There are some places that just promote people for reasons not related to job performance.", "Yes i agree.  I have 3 boys and they are in their twenties. I don't know where the years went.", "That's so true! I have a theory that time is just a way to keep everything from happening at once. ", "I know exactly what you mean. I have been let down many times, and it's never a good feeling.", "You can and should make the best of it. You should have a blast and binge watch some TV show!", "That's so exciting! Are you feeling nervous?", "I'm sure if you just relax and focus on being confident, you will do great! Best of luck!", "I bet you were a nervous wreck. I hope they turned out well.", "That's pretty good!  That should qualify for you to graduate with honors.", "That's awesome! How far did she have to run?", "I definately can't run a mile. She did great.", "Do she at least try to keep in contact with you?", "That's crazy. They shouldn't of taken advantage of your step father like that.", "That is too funny. Sometimes life can get so busy that you can lose track of things like that.", "Oh my gosh they did get you good. You have to get them back even if it's not on April Fools day!", "no. the door was unlocked so i thought it was safe to go in. boy was i wrong.", "i know but i turned beet red and couldn't fumble out of there fast enough. haha", "that's great. when will you know how you did?", "i hope so. is this a final exam?", "good luck!'", "That's so mean! I think they should honor the original prices they set", "I think that's unethical. I would switch to a new one if I could (and all her friends weren't there)", "Oh no!  And that is hard to get out!  Do you have a waterproof cover on the bed by any chance?", "oh YUCK!  Well, I'd suggest a waterproof mattress cover just in case it happens again.  At least if it does happen again, it won't get into the mattress and you can wash the rest of the bed clothes.  I'm so sorry you discovered it that way!", "Oh no! I think they're cute but I'd probably be freaked out if I saw one in my yard, too.

I never win anything cool.  Does he get to bring anyone? Maybe he can take you?", "Thats kind of mean of him.  Tell your boss that he cheated and that you should've won instead.

If you keep that in mind then a new car actually becomes a great investment!", "Oh definitely! They almost sound like crying humans sometimes.

You know my mom is terrified of all snakes even the ones that aren't poisonous.", "Most snakes aren't poisonous so hopefully it wasn't. Just know that it probably couldn't have hurt you, and I hope that you don't see any more in the future!!", "Oh really? What makes you not like them?", "Ugh I feel ya. They talked about that with mine, too. I almost passed out when they were doing the epidural!", "Puppies are the best! If they don't destroy all of your belongings that is!!", "Well, I'm glad that things seem under control.

Have you tried joining any meet up groups to make some friends?", "I'm sure it will make you feel a little better. And at least that way you can pick a group based on similar interest. I hope you get to feeling better.", "I really liked Logan. It was a different kind of superhero movie. More about the struggle than anything.", "The scene with his daughter was pretty sad. I don't blame you at all.", "dude that is freakin awesome , im sure you earned it ", "i hope you have a lot of fun , i cant wait to go on my vacation as well ", "No I haven't, I'm not interested in soccer. Why, did I miss something good?", "Were you rooting for them to win?", "Did he not seem like the type to do that kind of thing?", "I guess she wanted to keep it a secret for some reason.", "Ouch, that is a bit of a false alarm/bummer.", "Well you can only keep going and keep playing.

Are you glad that you have moved on?", "That is good, you can't live in the past", "Oh yeah? I was a little too young to be playing that game when it came out.

Sometimes the most important charity is your own.", "I like to think that if you get yourself right financially now, you'll be more able to help more in the future. ", "That's good advice.  If you're not happy doing something you should spend time thinking about what you'd really like to be doing.", "Even if she's strict she's probably doing because she wants what's best for you.

I would be afraid too.", "Are you able to afford one?", "Good things come to those who wait, I know it's hard now because your friend got one but it'll work out for you", "You should to them before you do that", "Well maybe should be civil", "Was the cake god? Sometimes you have to have your cake and eat it too haha. ", "That sounds so yummy! See you much have needed those calories with skipping meals. Sounds like your a great baker as well.", "Yes. It has been a week. We couldnt male our homemade pizzas like we do every saturday.", "That sounds like a plan", "im sorry to hear that , whant happened ?", "always believe in yourself, and dont let others opinions dictate your feelings ", "Don't worry about it. Everybody messes up sometimes!", "It just take a lot of practice, but you will get there!", "what was it", "oh thats sweet", "That is great.  Congatulations!!!! Did you get a big raise, too?", "It always feel good to get what you deserve!", "I am beginning to feel alone now. Thats no fun", "I have but never got a second date. Dating is so different now.", "I hope so. I guess I shouldnt rush", "Why is that", "I do too, its okay", "sorry to hear that.. what happened", "hopefully she didnt suffer.", "I hate that for you", "I can understand tat", "Oh wow, any special reason for him doing that?", "How sweet of him.", "That's always so fun to see everything that's gone on in your life.  Do you have a favorite moment that was captured in a picture?", "They grow up so fast!  How many kids do you have?", "Sounds like you are so blessed though!  I know you must miss them while they're away.  You have been a priceless influence on them.  They will always love you!", "That's too bad. You're not quitting are you?", "They will get over it", "That's a pretty wild story. Why do you think the aliens chose you in particular?", "Well be sure to lock your doors and windows before bed tonight, hopefully that will keep them out.", "Oh wow, that's a pretty scary movie.  I'd want company while watching it too.", "I get what you mean.  Some films just aren't for some people.  It takes some courage to watch.", "Good luck.  But besides it being scary it's a good film in general.  Hope you two can enjoy it.", "oh thats really nice , my friend in new york also has to do a test soon to get a promotion, i hope u get it - u can do it !!!", "promotions are always good more money ,and a better life i believe in you !!!", "I think that you are absolutely right!  Thanksgiving is the best!  I love the food, and family.  Are your family coming to you, or are you going to the?", "Is the brother from Germany coming home?", "That sucks, Did you reschedule?", "I hate when that happens. Especially when the same people do it over and over.", "Why would she do that", "That is sad", "It wasn't Dave Ramsey was it?", "Ha I took a shot in the dark. I have heard him recommended a lot for people who want to learn how to pay down debt and save money.", "No I think it was stolen. We went to the park and i dont know what happened.", "IT does. I am wondering if it will turn up. Trying to be optimistic", "That is terrible. ", "I don't know. They should be locked up though. Hurting a person is next.", "They did unfortunately. I'll just never understand people who like to make everyone else miserable just because they are.", "Sorry they DIDN'T. I know right! Always walking on eggshells! I'll never get it! Just be in peace or behave. One of the two", "That would be great wouldn't it? They have it made!", "Yeah but you also wouldn't live as long either. ", "I know that feeling.  I have a husband and a boyfriend living here and it still feels empty.", "Maybe maybe LOL.. I have four dogs.. argh!", "It's nice to have generous friends.  Did you have something good?", "Ohhh, delicious. ", "Its nice to have a reliable person like that", "I am sure he will do a good job", "IT was about going back to school. She had average grades in English last year. I was surprised it was so good.", "She is almost 14. ", "Did they have a good reason?", "Well maybe you can reschedule and do something even more fun", "I have to turn them into the school tomorrow. Now I will be late for work because I have to do new ones at the school in the morning.", "I hate being late but I have to get the papers in", "It's always nice to visit with friends you haven't seen in a while.", "I'm happy to hear you enjoyed yourself!", "More money is always nice", "That sounds awesome", "Did you have fun? ", "It's always nice when an event lives up to the hype. Was it at a bar or a house or where?", "That's great. I wish my daughter was determined like that.", "In the classes that she likes. It is pretty frustrating for me", "Is it? lol. I plan to go on a cruise with my close friends. Hopefully they don't flake.", "It will be whether they show up or not", "There are some apps that allow a friend to follow your progress as you home. Will that make you feel safer?", "Ducks are scary, but they are more scared of you than you are of them. ", "Whats it about?", "oooh all that physics makes my head spin", "Oh love! I can only imagine the feelings you must be experiencing. Do you have a good support system in place?", "I'm so glad you have people to lean on -- though obviously, your experience is *yours* and no one can know exactly how you're feeling. Are you familiar with Kris Carr, with your interest in a plant-based approach to diet?", "She's very inspiring -- you'll love her! Sending you ALL the best in healing vibes, love, and light!", "Oh well, there is always next time", "Just try and keep in touch when you can", "I'm really glad to hear that! What kind of job is it, if you don't mind me asking?", "Oh, that sounds pretty cool. I kind of had my eye on a career like that when I was in school, but ultimately didn't go that route. What will you be doing specifically?", "I bet that was disgusting! I would bring a noseplug from now on.", "I love hiking, I can't imagine happening upon something so gross. Would probably ruin my hike as well!", "That's really sweet of you. I hope your cat is doing better!", "Well I'm sure with you taking care of him, he'll be fine!", "That does sound fun though", "I hope you have fun", "That's what pictures are for. Are you guys ever going to live together?", "We that's good. The photos will keep you close", "The snails? Yikes. Well, I've always thought it probably gets a worse rap than it actually should, and probably doesn't taste that bad. Half of why I think it's probably gross is simply because they made it seem gross in old cartoons. So, how did it taste?", "Yeah, that's true! Especially since you were on a cruise, it sounds like it's all a part of the experience. At least you can say you didn't chicken out. I'm glad you decided to go that way, because now you have a special memory tied to that vacation;", "I don't. She is a young woman now and its too much for me lol", "I am going to cry now lol", "That sucks? Did you see anything?", "I can imagine. I had a car stolen once while I was at work. Broke my heart", "I don't usually like shows like that, but the writing is so good. I watch it every Sunday", "Drugs. That's why I was apprehensive", "That's great, so you enjoy looking after them?", "Yeah I can understand that! Well at least they have each other, and hopefully they will grow more social together", "That happens sometimes. Sometimes life just gets in the way. Heck, sometimes you just decide you can't physically do a night out, and that's okay, too. I'm sure they'd understand no matter what. Maybe you can make it up to them somehow.", "Maybe take a few days to think it over, and then when the weekend comes, think of a way to surprise them in order to make it up to them. Or if nothing else, just be as honest as possible and not try to cover anything up when you need to bail on them. They'll appreciate that the most.", "I am sorry, I guess some friends just argue like that", "I am sure you guys will make up", "I love visiting breweries! What's your favorite kind of beer?", "Not my favorite but I had a really good one the other day with some kind of fruit in it, I could have downed a gallon of the stuff.", "Ohhh gotta hate that friend!   What do you drive?", "I drive a gianormous conversion van", "well i had my parents back then.. and sodas were only a quarter.", "Candy bars.. 25 cents too.  Cigarettes.. 75 cents", "Wow, congratulations to him! He must have been studying very hard for his exams.", "I'm sure he has a bright future ahead! Tell him to keep up the good work.", "oh, dear. That sounds lonely. How are you holding up?", "I can imagine. But you'll make new connections there, I'm sure.", "I know how you feel.  I moved about 3 hours away from my hometown for school and stayed for 3 years and hated it.  I moved back to my hometown and am so happy now.  I'm sorry you're having a tough time.  Have you gotten out and tried to meet people?", "I would go with your gut.  Sometimes things don't work out, but you might just need more time to meet people and might want to hang in there.  I hope you meet a best friend soon!", "That is a great friend! I'm happy you were able to see your family.", "She sounds like one of a king! Not many people are that generous.", "Wow that's really frustrating. ", "Oh yuck! That is so gross!", "I do, too.  We just need to take better care of the resources we have and plant more trees.  Do you do anything \"green\".", "If we could just get more people on board to do that we would be on the right track.", "I am glad that he did. It is always good to stay hopeful.", "That's great. Health scares are very real and scary.", "I LOVED Disneyland growing up! Did you go often? How old were you and what was your favorite ride?", "Ha! I hear you on that. I also loved the Matterhorn! And the Haunted House. We used to spend summers in Tucson with my grandparents, and they would drive us to Disneyland every year ;-)", "That's awesome! What a nice surprise. And congratulations on graduating. That's a big accomplishment. What did you graduate in? ", "Oh, very cool. I thought about majoring in English, too, but decided to go a different route. I hope your new degree helps you land the job you want! You're now in the exciting unknown part of your life.", "Just try and teach them to be more careful with them", "I am sure it will get beter", "That's so nice of him to do. No one wants to help anyone out these days but I'm glad for you.", "There's always Uber!", "I am so sorry to hear that! Cancer is such a horrible disease.", "I've actually lost two family members last year, so I can relate. It's something that will stick with you until the day you die.", "That's unfortunate. Does she know that it happened?", "I am sorry to hear that. Maybe next time you can just ask her.", "Best of luck to you. The tension and nerves must be killing you!", "It's a tough market out there, but I have faith that you get what you desire!", "I am sorry you have that. It must be rough", "I can only imagine", "Wow, congratulations on getting a new job!  I think butterflies are good to have to make us do our best and it shows your job is important to you and you want to do a good job.  What do you do?", "That sounds fun. Have you done something like it before or is the whole kind of job new to you?  Good luck and I know you'll do great!  Act confident even if you don't feel like it. Sometimes that can help.", "Ah, that's rough. That was a very bold move on your part. But sometimes fortune favors the bold, as they say. I think you'll be happy later on not having to wonder \"what if.\" Still though, she could have maybe been more discrete about things.", "Ah, I see. Well, it's a good thing you were rejected thing, maybe. At least now you know what kind of a bullet you dodged. Plus, this is just another step in your overall confidence and character building. The next time you ask someone else out, it will be easier.", "That is very nice of him.", "Yes, a very cool thing.", "Sometimes that can be a good thing? It's not always so bad!", "Maybe next weekend will be better for you!", "I hate when those come around", "I am sure it will soon", "you should not feel bad ,we all need alone time", "honesty is great and all , but sometimes you need some time to yourself, i feel you on that tho", "Oh wow, that's great! Only bad thing is he will be very busy with two jobs.", "That's great to hear!", "There is nothing wrong with that at all. I've done it a few times before. Nobody in the theater knows or cares that you're there alone.", "If you always wait for somebody to come with you, you may miss out on a movie that you want to see as well. So there's that.", "where are you going", "oh thats cool", "I'm glad to hear something positive happened to you. Were you able to do something fun or productive with the time off? And what was the occasion?", "Ah, pretty cool. It's nice that you decided to have family time instead of just alone time. I bet they were excited, too. Hopefully work rewards you more often like that.", "I would love to do that as well", "I would love to go to hawaii", "That's great! It's hard to do that sometimes, especially on the weekends!", "I'm proud of you for sticking to it!", "I think it might have been something large. There was a lot of noise and scratching.", "It could be! Sometimes what I imagine it to be is worse than what it is in reality.", "Oh no, what did they say to convince you?", "Maybe I'm too gullible as well because that would convince me!", "That is a relief. Did any coworker friends get laid off?", "I've been there. It's so sad, but it will get better. ", "Maybe you can change that jealous energy into positive energy! Do some research into fitness and start a new journey.", "One tip I tell people is that they don't need to change WHAT they eat, only how much. Calorie intake is the important factor, not what type of calories.", "Holy cow, that's terrible. I really feel for you. My dad had that happen to him and his dog when he was young, and he's told me about it as a warning to make sure I'm safe with ours. I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I hope you get through the grieving process okay.", "I would definitely take as long as you need, so you don't put unhealthy pressure or expectation on the animal to live up to a memory it can't live up to. But if you feel comfortable with the idea, then I would consider it when the time is right. You'll know when that is.", "That's great, what did he give you?", "Do you know why he gave it to you?", "Well, after a few days of getting worse, took him to his primary dr.  He gave antibiotics for a sore throat.", "Nope.  Got worse, went to an ENT and finally got the correct antibiotics.  ER bill, Dr. bill and ENT bill for what started as a simple sore throat.", "Oh now that's exciting! I moved two years ago and it was a very weird process. I was happy to have a new home but anxious at the same time.", "Well that's great. I'm happy to hear you guys are getting out of a bad home.", "Oh, I totally understand.  It's frustrating when you feel like you're putting in the same effort (or more!) and it works better for other people.  ", "Well, it's good that at least you're making progress!  It would be crazy frustrating if you weren't.  Congrats on your hard work paying off. ", "Ah yes, does it bring back good memories? Nostalgia is a powerful thing.", "I'm so glad that you had the chance to make those memories with your cousins!", "That sure is embarrassing, did he get talked to about his behavior? ", "I agree, at that age kids should definitely know better and think before doing something. Unbelievable. ", "You should be proud. These are the moments you are never going to want to forget.", "Yeah, but don't worry. More memories are yet to come!", "Your youthful vigor? You think you're too old now? You're only too old if you allow yourself to be. My girlfriend's 90-year-old grandfather was a full-of-life WWII vet who lit up the room when he came in. Of course, you're not as physically active, but you have to learn to utilize your life in different ways.", "Well, maybe it's an opportunity for introspection. For you to take time out of your day to think about what you need and want, and what are the best ways to achieve that. Maybe you need a better diet, or sleep schedule, or meditation, or an exercise routine. Sometimes you have to spend energy to feel energized. It's a slow process in the beginning, but it can be life-changing.", "Any plans for Friday?", "That's awesome! I bet these next few days will fly by", "I bet you were! What kind of laptop was it? ", "My husband also has a Lenovo. He really likes it!", "Wowza! That's impressive. I wonder how long until he's called up.", "You will be able to say you saw him before he was famous! ", "I'm really sorry to hear that... That's the worst scenario too, because you're parked and probably not even there, so you were completely powerless in the situation, and then you come back to your car to just have this bomb dropped on you. Maybe there's something that can be worked out, since you just purchased it.", "There has to be something. It can't just be this weird vulnerable loophole. I really hope so, for your case, because that's just unfair. I'm sure your work will understand, but it's still a crummy situation that is probably affecting all areas of your life. Transportation gets taken for granted. Hope things get better soon.", "I'm so glad you got to visit with them!  I know how you feel to be far from family and home alone.  Take heart that you are loved by your family and friends even when they aren't around.", "I can see why its even harder on you when they leave.  That's wonderful that they are such a part of your life.  Take care and get out with friends soon to brighten your spirits!", "That's quite scary!  Are you able to see who it is?", "You might want to call 911 if they continue banging on the door.  Better safe than sorry!", "Wow, how long has he been juggling for?", "I wonder how people figure that thing out about themselves? Very cool, though.", "What is interesting is that I was certain he had caught me, but what I didn't realize was that one travelling behind me on the interstate must have been going faster than I was.", "I did pull over, and the police officer ended up behind the two of us.  He told me to move along.  Lucky day, ... indeed. ", "Oh, no.  I think I see where this is headed.  ", "LOL.  Do you really think so?  That has happened to me before.  Sometimes, it's just too hard to pass up.  Thank you for sharing.  ", "Congratulations on making a plan and sticking with it. What kind of diet are you doing?", "You can do anything (realistically) as long as you stay consistent and take it one day at a time!", "did it bite you!", "oh thats cool then", "That would really anger me as well.  What did you do?  Did you find the person who did it?", "Yeah, it blows my mind that people think they can damage other peoples belonging and just go about their day.  ", "I'm happy for you! Everyone deserves to be excited about life.", "Thank you very much. Much success to you!", "Your family was being polite. If I did that my family would order a pizza, hah.", "It's all good. Maybe you should try something simple like Hamburger Helper. Can't really  mess that up.", "I didn't even know they were making another, I loved the first!", "That is friggin' awesome! I sure hope they can keep up the quality in the upcoming movies.", "Congratulation.", "You had a good idea. Each of us need to find the correct way to lose weight.", "Wow, good luck.  I hope it all goes well. It sounds like you're confident that it will. Have you done one before?", "I know you're do great then!  Hope it brings you a lot of success!", "Really?  That is awesome.  I used to watch reruns of that show all the time.", "I will have to try to watch it.  Sounds like a good time", "Those poor dogs! I hate puppy mills so much and unfortunately I live in an area where they are very common.", "There are laws here but they find ways around them. People are cruel and only care about money.", "Oooh I don't like owls... they creep me out", "was it big", "did you get to keep them?", "thats awesome", "That is awesome, did you ask your boss for one or was it unexpected? ", "That must mean you're a hard worker. You should keep at it then!", "I hate that. That's one of my biggest pet peeves. That's such an awkward situation, because you don't want to come off as high maintenance and ask them to stop, but it'd be so easy for them to have better manners, too. I wish I had better advice. Maybe go to HR?", "Yeah, absolutely. That's what I meant earlier, too, about being high maintenance. I don't know, maybe earbuds? But I'm sure you've tried that. Who knows how they would respond if you asked them personally, and if they actually did improve, they'd probably just forget and revert back in a few days anyway.", "Wow!  That is impressive!  You must be really prod of yourself!", "Haha!  That's funny!  I work out to drink and eat bad food as well!  Awesome achievement with your running!  Keep at it!", "Hey, honest mistake. Obviously you didn't come up with some dumb lie and make it seem like they made the mistake and not you. You owned up to it. I'm sure they appreciate that more than you would figure.", "I'm glad! It's the honest truth. Everyone screws up. And I bet it will motivate you to never make that mistake again, too. So in the end, they have someone who's sharper about things. Good to hear it worked out in your favor.", "That's actually a really good point.. I do online gaming, so I have tons of online friends, almost all of which I'm sure I'll never meet. And I definitely have lost touch with most of them, just because it's so easy to. I don't really do social media either, so I don't have that to kind of glue things together. Wonder why it's hard for adults to keep friends", "Really appreciate your perspective. That's awesome. Online friends are every bit as good. I'm with you there. Hope things stay good with yoou", "That's so unfair. I would complain very loudly if that happened to me!", "I feel your pain. Life is really unfair sometimes.", "Stranger things is one of my favorite shows!  It stinks that the next season has been pushed to next summer though.", "I feel ya.  The kids will be all grown up by then!", "That is awesome!  He is such an amazing athlete!  Any team that has him is lucky!", "I guarantee they will!  That's raw talent right there!", "wow .. so am i .. i could not imagine doing that. its great that you are going to do it though", "i wish you good luck.. ", "Oh, my dad use to play with those all the time when we were young and he'd let us touch them!", "I never did want to hold it, but I was curious enough to touch it! They're actually kind of cute.", "Oh no! I hate when that happens... hopefully your computers holds on a little longer for it to go back down", "Well good luck! I know how frustrating that can be", "Wow, why are they still shooting off fireworks? Don't they know it's a one day holiday?", "I agree. It must be hard to get any sleep. I feel bad for any animals in the area too!", "yea i hear that... it was much better back then", "that i think you are right", "That is impressive. He must have been prepared well for the switch.", "Good for him. It takes me forever to find a job.", "a girl... time is going fast but slow at the same time", "No second, I have another girl :)", "Thanks!", "Yeah it was so cool! She and my husband secretly coordinated it. ", "Yeah I'm pretty lucky :)", "Where were you at? Why couldn't you go home? Sounds frustrating.", "Oh that is frustrating. I bet you were very annoyed.", "oh wow.. first time going to france?", "thats awesome .. i wish i could go there.. ", "That sounds lonely. Maybe you should try to hang out with some of your classmates?", "I hear you. At least it is only for a month. Maybe you can make some weekend trips to do fun things.", "That's hilarious!  Did you try to play it off like you meant to do that?", "Well, at least you were honest about it.  I bet you will never put your shirt on inside out again!  So, consider it a lesson learned!", "It is always good to take the time to reflect on happy memories.  I do that from time to time myself", "I am glad you were able to look back fondly and remember that good times.", "Oh, man!  That is a nightmare!  Was your boss upset with you?", "Yeah, it happens to the best of us.  You just have to try and forget about it and move forward.", "That is great! Do you have any fun plans?", "Oh wow! That will be really fun!", "whats wrong with your cat", "im sorry to hear that.. she will be in peace soon enough.", "That would make me mad. Did you know who did it?", "That's too bad. Maybe they could check security cameras for you.", "time to look for one that deserves you", "i hope you find happiness .. doesnt look like its gonna be with him.. goodluck though!", "I'm so sorry to hear that. What happened?", "I would be heart-broken as well. You know you can always talk to me if you need to", "I have no idea why it's happening all at once, but I had that cat for a good long while. He was such a great cat.", "I sure do hope so too. I bet they're best buds just playin' around in the afterlife.", "Me either! Not at all!", "They all creep me out!", "That was very nice. Why couldn't you have a baby shower?", "Yes, that is nice. A baby shower, just without the people. Still great!", "Oh no! Inquiring minds want to know... is there plans for a second date?", "Well, you don't want to date someone who doesn't like coffee anyway. :)", "That's great! How does that make you feel?", "You should go out and meet friends! Go out and do hobbies that you like. I bet you'll meet some new friends. Are you in a big city?", "I have no idea! I came home and my backyard gate was open. I can't find him anywhere. ", "It is sad, but I'm also feeling the complete opposite of sad! I miss him so much.", "Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Sometimes when you \"give up\", someone good comes along", "Maybe you can get a pet to distract you. It could even help socialize like if you get a dog and go to a dog park", "That is awesome. Your kiddo will be talking your ear off in no time.", "Yeah I know how it is. My kids drive me nuts now. They are 8 and 9.", "Man, that sucks. Are you going to go back and return it or did you eat it already?", "I say in that case don't worry about it. Mistakes happen.", "Yeah, it was pretty frightening. But we eventually found a small city.", "We just tried to follow an intersate highway until we found something. We felt pretty lucky when we did.", "It mean that you are smart.", "You never know.", "That's great! I know that is an amazing feeling to have.", "That's wonderful. A car is one of the most useful purchases one can make I think.", "Ouch, I bet that must have hurt!", "That could be some trauma there... but I am sure you will get back into the swing of things (no pun intended).", "That is unfortunate. Did they reschedule the picnic?", "I'm glad you feel better knowing that it will happen next week.", "I live with her now.  In fact she's sitting right next to me this very moment.", "Thank you.  I am also greatful to have found my person :D", "Ultrasound and an old tale that if the heart rate was above 160 it was definitely a girl lol", "awe whats their names? Both my girls have two middle names but first names are AvaLea pronounced AvaLee and my second is Myah :P", "Awe :) I like the name Archer for a boy ^_^. But here is the kicker! My eldest daughter was born September 27 and my youngest was born September 28 xD", "Thats awesome! I hope the visit goes well :)", "Oh wow so the pressure is on to make a good impression haha", "That's great! Good luck! That attitude says a lot.", "That's a recipe for success. I think you'll crush it.", "Wow that's a bold move. How is he getting along with that?", "That's great! I think as long as he is happy, he's doing whatever is right for him.", "That's great. I'm a native spaker, but from what I understand English is very hard to actually learn", "They absolutely do. Kids are like sponged. It's been said that it's much easier for kids to learn multiple languages than adults", "what kind of exam is it , and you sound confident you got this ", "That is awesome to hear , preparation will help you knock this out like a champ", "Yes I did! ", "Ah well, I'm sure you were good at other things. I was glad I was at least good at that. I didn't find myself too interesting so I had a very hard time fitting in so that was the only thing I was able to be proud of at that time =) ", "Were you doing it in a public place? Weed can do that to someone.", "You may want to smoke less next time. Do it in moderation.", "That's too bad.  Have you given serious thought to trying to lose weight?", "Hmmm.   I encourage you to keep trying.   Even if you don't ge tto your dieal weight, just getting halfway would show trememndous progress.", "That is so romantic. I also try to surprise my girlfriend occasionally with some little gifts", "Such things even though may seem little have much positive impact on couple's relationship", "Wow good for him. Now he can drive you around.", "He is moving forward pretty fast. But that means you can ride with him that much sooner.", "Wow im sorry to hear that. It sucks when something goes wrong at a job you've been there long", "I'm glad you found a job quick! That must have felt a little good to tell them at least", "Don't you hate how \"customer service\" has no service anymore?  Did you get the refund at least?", "I'm sorry that you had to experience that.  It's totally unfair!", "What makes life so hard right now?", "Very true. What would you want to do in the 60's?", "What if people think I'm a nerd? This will be my first year at a new school.", "That's very true. I could do that! Thanks for the advice.", "I sure am! They are so excited to be starting a great new chapter in their lives.", "A little bit of both. One really likes Journalism while the other favors engineering and computer science, but they do tell me they are stressed about starting.", "Congrats! Time really does fly by, doesn't it? What was your favorite moment from it all/", "Aww, that does sound quite lovely. Before you know it it'll be 20 years! Any special plans then?", "Well studying is a good place to start.

Nothing like it did in the past.", "Oh, tell me more!", "Oh I love Pikachu!", "Have you considered tring to work out?", "That's unforunate.", "that is bad, are there other options?", "that is okay then, but still anoying", "Wow, I bet you were blown away. Where was the vacation at?", "I have never been there, but heard a it's beautiful.", "thats great, thats how you should be", "yes unfortunately", "Is it hot where you live?", "I get that, I am sure it is not fun regardless", "No need to be jealous, I am sure you are much better than him in certain areas.", "I am sure you are much happier at home than he is...lol.", "I don't blame you. I am always nervous at interviews. Don't worry, I'm sure you will do great!", "You will be fine, just don't make yourself too nervous!", "Did you help them out?", "that is for sure, everyone has a ploy", "Oh no. Did you fnd your dog?", "I am so sorry to hear that. Have you tried calling your local shelters?", "thats cool.  i hope it works out for you", "im sure it will!", "That's a bit rude if you ask me.", "I can see why. Some people just don't know when to keep things to themselves.", "That stinks. When did you get out?", "Well, at least you got out", "What did she want?", "Ohh wow! Those are expensive I bet", "Why were you irked?", "Wow! what a jerk", "Awesome, what field do you work in?", "Ha, same.  Are you at work right now?

Does she still ride?", "thats nice of you, what does she like?", "lucky you!", "Oh man. I'm sorry. Do you still have a cordial relationship with your ex?", "Have you talked to your friend?", "That's no fun. Why not?", "Well you can always try to make it better. Maybe you should try to get out more?", "thats awesome, i bet they are thrilled", "that is really cool", "Oh no! That sounds so irritating. Have you tried talking to your boss about him?", "That's understandable. He sounds clueless. I've had many coworkers like that, and the best way I've found to deal with them is run away as much as possible.", "Wow, I'd be really nervous too. But I know you can do it!", "Well is it after your lunch break? Maybe we can go out and have lunch, and I'll do my best to get you pumped up for it!", "Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that.", "Yeah, don't worry too much about it. There are plenty of others out there.", "That sounds like such a thoughtful surprise! Did you enjoy it?", "How come? Isn't the surprise half the fun?", "As much as I could.  There's still some stuck in the treads on my shoe.", "They are new shoes! :(", "That sucks.  Neither did I.   I know how you feel.", "I ended up getting an internship then started working at the place... never finished the degree.", "That sounds terrible, i would have cried!", "I understand stand that for sure.", "That's great, what kind of dog is it?", "Oh wow I only have small dogs, I can't imagine training a big dog.", "she is aware but doesn't feel the need to do anything about it. that's what makes it worse", "not directly inhouse", "i've tried. she says she will talk to him but nothing changes.", "I hope it goes well! are you prepared?", "I think you'll do great!", "It's a good way to yo keep you two together.", "Has he passed?", "I'm so sorry to hear that. It must be stressful. Everything will get better.", "Look into hotel. I feel into a hotel job after I lost my job years ago and not manage one. It's a great job. Just don't down on your self. ", "I hope everything is okay.", "That is a good attitude.", "I would have slapped him so fast.", "I would have just as mad as you are!", "Wow, How lucky! I love to travel.", "Wow, It must be a great job. I have a friend that works for a travel agency in Boston in a similar situation. She said since she started she has been to 32 different countries. ", "Oh no, your a/c isn't working?! This is a bad time of year for that!", "Man that's awful, I'm sorry. I hope you're able to get it fixed, and soon!", "Aww man.. I am sorry.  Is she at least a good person?", "Karma will get here someday.", "That is amazing, care to share?", "I wish, one day that I could get a check in the mail.", "Oh no! Do you have any alternatives?", "Oh I'm so sorry :( I hope you can find something suitable, even if you make it yourself", "Wow, thats so sad. Has he been on the list long?", "I'm sorry to hear your going through so much stress. My grandmother was on the heart Transplant list for about a month before getting a new heart. Maybe it will be that fast for him.", "Thanks, she got the heart and is doing better. Wow, he is to young for this stress. Good Luck to him and you.", "I'm sorry to hear that.  Maybe next time?", "I hope you feel better about it.", "That is terrible. What did you do about it?", "Did you talk to her?", "I'm sure. But it's a fresh start. Your the new person you can make people think any thing about you that you want.", "Just be your self then. Who cares what they think.", "Oh no, is there something wrong with your dog?", "I know words don't really help in this situation, but I'm so sorry. I've lost many pets and it rips your heart out. I'm sure you're dog had a great life with you if it's any consolation.", "Oh no! Were you prepared?", "I bet you will make it up next time.", "What about it?", "That is very nice memories.", "Do you want to yell at him and call him a liar?", "One time i secretly called my boss's wife and outted him for an affair he was having with one of my coworkers.. lol he never knew..", "that stinks i'm sorry", "at least you didn't damage your bike", "cringe under my skin as i got them worked up for the nurse to treat them", "i was just terrified to catch lice.", "A friend", "Yep, especially when they texted me earlier that day saying they would call me.", "Surely, it was just your imagination.", "I can definitely see why all those things would scare you and make you think you saw a ghost.", "That is great!  It is always nice when hard work is rewarded.", "Well congratulations!  That is a good way to start the work week.", "Oh goodness, I hope you are okay.", "I really understand your concern.", "That sucks.  I think that happens to everyone, accept the one girl who became a doctor.", "Try not to let it get to you.  Life is weird.", "Sorry about that.  What I wanted to say is... I am feeling mighty accomplished today.  I won my jousting tournament.", "My whole life pretty much.  It was cool me and my horse were just so in sync today.", "I am from MD it is the state sport there..", "I know I'm annoyed I have to pay the bill.", "I'm not too hopeful about it!", "Eww that's so gross.", "I bet, I wish some people had better manners.", "I can't find out.  The one on the ground I was worried about. she wasn't moving", "Yeah, A girl I know was walking along the road and got killed by a car only a week ago.", "Very shocking to say the least, thanks", "How is that so?", "Heh that's so cute!", "LOL! What did you do?", "That's terrible! Can you do anything about it?", "Wow, it sounds like you have a lot to be grateful for.", "I am so happy for you.", "Yay!  What type of dog?", "I love a nice squishy face.  I have a Japanese Chin and 3 MinPin", "yeah a lot like pekinese.. now you know why I have a 10 bedroom house!", "No, the  real estate lady said she would be by Wednesday. Can't wait to get out of here. It's in a flood zone .", "Yes, that is it. Too stressful, but it's in a good area and someone could raise it if they wanted to.", "thank you. i was able to talk to them later but at the moment i just wanted to vent so bad and couldn't", "it's ok. i appreciate your kindness", "I hope you're well prepared!", "That's good, you sound very prepared and I'm sure it'll be alright.", "Oh no, that sounds scary.", "Thank goodness it wasn't something serious.", "That can be embarrassing.  Are you ok?", "Sounds painful.  I hope you didn't cause any damage.", "That is good, you must be very religious.", "That is very nice of you to help those that are needy.", "Watch out State Farm!  lol.  Congratulations!", "That is awesome.  She can drive for you now!", "I have, I have.. I smoke pot instead.", "I might explore those options the next time I go to my dispensory!", "They can not curt you. They are tiny and powerless. ", "don't eat them then.", "He was certainly very intelligent, you can definitely increase your own knowledge though if you work at it.", "Try reading some books or maybe practicing math problems I guess.", "That isn't good. What did you do when you stepped in the poop?", "Did you throw the sandals away or just clean them?", "I guess you were pretty hungry then, huh? Well, I'm sure your friend doesn't mind sharing!", "Well, all you could do was apologize and offer to buy another one. He'll get over it, I'm sure!", "That's nice. Have you always done that?", "I've never been a person of faith. My parents weren't either.", "I've never driven a truck, only small vehicles! How's that working out for you?", "Aw, I'm glad you have something like that to remember him by. That's a great connection to him to have.", "Oh my! I really hope that you find your stuff. Do the cops have any leads?", "Well I really hope that your insurance was able to cover what you lost. ", "That is great. It is always good to have some recognition for the good job done.", "That is nice.", "Why would you ever move away from the Caribbean.", "Where did you move to after the hurricane?", "Sounds great, i've never been but would love to.", "How many times you've been?", "That's awesome!  How much did you win?", "$100 bucks still sounds great to me!", "Addiction is a scary thing! I wish him the best.", "Yes it takes a lot of courage to do that.", "That's nice of her, it's good you have such a caring mother.", "Yes I'm very grateful for my mother for taking very good care of me.", "She takes care of me the best she can.", "Your friend takes care of me the best he can.", "Awesome. I was in Sturgis in 2004. Did you ride out or trailer your bike?", "Lucky, be careful some people can get carried away out their. ", "where is it shipping from? is it a reputable store?", "yeah. hopefully you will have better luck with it.", "i tried to stay positive and see the bright side of it but boy was i itchy afterward", "i have really long hair so it would be torture", "Is it an engineering job or something else.", "That is great. Would you be an astronaut then?", "Finally figured out what was wrong. They go in one direction and you have to keep them thinking they are going in that direction or they get confused. Weird huh.", "me too, it's awful seeing that constantly in the road.", "No I haven't ", "I hate it when my team loses too. All that time invested for a loss is disappointing. ", "Do you like your job or is this something you dread?", "Well I hope you find something you love and you're happy to do. Still searching for that myself.", "Which supplies did you get?", "Oh that sounds like fun!", "Where to? What location?", "Wow, you will be fine. Years ago I went to Japan to teach English and also got called to duty and spent time in Iraq and a few other places. Once you arrive it's never as bad as you will have it built in your head.", "I used to hate cold but after menopause I have changed my mind.", "Yeah, I want one of those cool pillows, I'm constantly turning my over.", "Oh great. That is so fun . My baby died a few years ago. But he was over 14 , so. ", "Thanks. At least he lived a pretty good long time . He was a beagle mix named Jack.", "I'm sorry.. my first gut reaction was to laugh a little. I really don't mean to make fun of you. That's terrible! Was it because you didn't want to miss a part of the movie, so you tried to hold it in as long as possible?", "The movie did? It sounds like maybe at least it was a good movie, if that's any consolation. I hope no one made fun of you. It's a common human mistake.", "I have never been to an airport honestly.", "I like to stay home where I know i'm a little saffer.", "Maybe tell him how you feel about that.", "Punch him right in the nose, that will fix things i'm sure!", "That's too bad. Are you going to replace it?", "Maybe you will be able to replace it soon. What happened to it?", "That's a way to make a buck! Ebay?", "You are my hero.", "I see that more in the country I guess. That would be horrifying. But maybe he is just immune to pain?", "Sounds like he was ok. I've had injuries before and they weren't serious enough or worth the hassle of the emergency room. But he still had to take a trip to go somewhere. Don't be afraid to care though :) One person is all that is needed- Kindness is always good!", "It helps people who have PTSD, Autism, Bipolar, Depression and anyone with trauma- Brain issues- Its kind of like electro shock but without pain. It helps retrain your brain.", "No. I thought about going to school for counseling but I have had enough of that in my own household lol. I live with someone with a mental illness so I have had to learn a lot and figure stuff out. I have always been huge on research and reading and different things to help. It's been hard to help this person as they have SO many issues..even with meds and diet etc..It's been hard. So Neurofeedback seems promising in addition to many other therapies.", "You are VERY well spoken and smart! Thank you. I hope so too..it's for a loved one and life is NEVER easy with them, I hope so too! Thank you!", "oh i love looking at old photos", "my nieces and nephews are all growing up on me and my step kids are almost adults too. it goes by in a blink of an eye", "it did. i remember watching the cheese bubble up on the top when she made tuna casserole thinking how much longer is this going to take.", "it does. i wish the set wasn't $40 i would've bought it.", "I hope they weren't expensive shoes.", "That's a shame. Does your dog chew on shoes often?", "I hear you. I'm not ready to go back either. ", "I'm sure it will be ok. A new year is a new time to reinvent yourself. ", "I live in a small town with no car.", "I want to get a car one day i think.", "I would just go to the beach right now!", "Not mine at all, i enjoy my house.", " I bet that was a nice surprise. Why did you get it?", "You are lucky then. Always good to receive things you arent expecting. ", "I'm in college, so i'll be your friend.", " I wish I could be with you and not in school", "Did you just recently find out?", "Does it upset you? Just think, the family that raised you, actually pursued you and love you.", "Where that happened?", "What did you call to get towed?", "Maybe you should go by yourself. Normally wifes stay at home and clean.", "Maybe if you go somewhere else without the girl.", "Oh my gosh I hope you were ok!", "I'm really sure you will figure it out. ", "Maybe pray and she will hear you.", "Maybe she could if you tried.", "Adulting is hard that's for sure. Start playing it and streaming and make some money.", "I just read that youth was wasted on the young. lol Kind of apropos.", "It's funny how you learn things as you get older even if you aren't doing major things. Little things you can learn a lot from", "No, not really . They have to be taken by the end of the year. I might take a few days off here and there at the holidays.", "Thanks. Hope you have a great summer or what is left of it anyway!", "I'm sorry to hear that.", "I hope everything works out for you.", "I think I'm too young for that but man wouldn't that be nice today?", "I'm sure they were, I can barely afford to survive.", "Lol. Did you dare look inside?", "That is bad.  I  always try to remember how long stuff has been in there, but sometimes things hide on you in there.", "I don't like the idea of closing and consolidating schools and making the kids ride for thirty minutes to two hours on a bus both ways, just to save a few bucks.", "Ew interesting. I think high school and earlier is so important and college too.", "Yeah, especially if it was a good school and area to grow up in.", "Yeah that would be awesome!  What are you going to spend it on??", "Heck yeah!  That sounds like fun!  ", "Yeah I went fishing and caught a large catfish! Biggest fish I've ever caught!", "Not really.  I just started doing it again this year.  I used to fish as a kid all the time.", "ours is a family table too so i understand what you mean. i really need to refinish it", "a little. i am hoping my mother in law will be able to help me with it. she's done it before successfully.", "it's worth it to keep a family herloom", "from what i read they lack calcium. i gave them some ground eggshells lets see if it helps", "it seems like it. thank you. i'm being hopeful", "oh no. did you know the spirit you contacted?", "i would totally freak out", "he had pnemonia that got out of hand", "he is in rehab but it's been a 3 month journey and he is having to learn to move again", "Nothing.  I'm going to ride rollercoasters this weekend.  So scared of them.", "Yeah.  Maybe if I drink a couple beers before hand lol", "Hey that sounds exciting!!  Are you ready?", "Yeah I would be pumped too!  Is it coming with a raise as well?", "Oh man!!  Make sure to put some back for retirement or emergency fund!!", "Do you feel negative about it, or positive? It's hard to tell from your sentence. Maybe you feel both ways. If I were in your shoes, I could see how you would start to feel some more pressure in that situation. I was always the youngest child, so I never had pressure on me to accomplish anything by a certain time. If you're not happy about it, hopefully you can turn it into a positive so that your sister doesn't get any undue negativity.", "I can understand why you'd start to feel that way. I think it's good that you want to look inward instead of just blatantly blaming other people. That means you can start to look for ways to make you feel better about yourself, that are solutions! But nothing has to be \"wrong with you.\" For some, it just takes time. For others, they find it easier to accept someone to settle down with.", "Yeah, I am. I didn't even know they did across-the-country train rides... Those would be cool. Or maybe they would get boring because you'd start to feel cramped? Who knows. It just always seems like when you hear about trains in movies and TV, they have this romantic quality about them. Maybe it's because they feel like they're from a different era", "Oh man that sounds like a really cool idea. Thanks for telling me about that.. sometimes it's surprising the creative things people come up with", "That's awesome!  I bet you're a proud parent! ", "Is he getting any gifts because he's done so goo?!", "It was.  They had a blast and I caught the biggest catfish I've ever caught!", "Yeah it was a lot of fun.  Definitely need to do it again!", "Was it enjoyable?", "What did you do on the train?", "Did you clean the house yourself or hire someone to do it?", "How long did it take you to clean your house?", "That sounds nice. How come you didn\u2019t go with?", "I am with you there.  I hope you get a chance to go there sometime though. ", "I'm sorry, why can't you go out?", "Oh that's not fun.", "Did you ask the kid or the kid's parents to stop kicking your chair?", "How long was the flight you were on?", "Holy cow that's awesome!  Are we taking the kids??", "oh haha!  Is this your first time?", "Me too!  We're hitting up Panama City in a couple weeks!", "There's more stuff to do than the beach though! ", "That sounds fun to go to.", "I love going to the movies and getting food!", "Oh, why did you cheat on her?", "It's a man's world, isn't it.", "Hey that's good.  What was wrong with it?", "That's pretty awesome.  I don't guess it cost too much then.", "It was every bit of 10-15 lbs catfish.  Scared the heck out of me when he hit on the bait!", "Not yet.  Probably will in a couple days. It was a great weekend to say the least!", "I was pretty humiliated, but I went up a few rows and forgot about it before the end of the movie.  When the lights came back on I was reminded of at all over again though.", "Good advice!", "That is terrible.  Did you get hurt badly?", "Were there a lot of people around?", "Must be nice!  Do you think he will let you ride it?", "I would be too, those things are really nice. ", "Oh, that sounds like a hassle.", "Oh that's not cool, get a different one.", "Uh oh!!  I hope it wasn't a prank lol", "I bet.  I would be too!  Was the food good??", "Pleasure.  I just hope my car makes the 9 hour drive.  she has about 167k miles on her :/", "Yeah..  I hope she does okay", "Oh no!  Happens to the best of us.  Are you feeling better now?", "Oh no!  I would hope that people had compassion for your situation and if they didn't, well shame on them.  I once peed my pants at a wedding I was laughing so hard. ", "Oh no! But I think black snakes are good? They eat nasty bugs and rodents!", "Oh wow, that's a big snake!", "Oh wow, what was the award for?", "Oh congratulations! You are a true hero", "That is so sweet.  How did he lose his leg?", "I've heard that it doesn't bother them to lose one limb.  I watch Dr. Jeff on Animal Planet a lot and that is what he says.", "I'm so sorry.  I have dealt with a lot of sleep problems and night panic attacks so I know how hard it can be dealing with things like that. I have a friend who does the same thing. Don't be humiliated.  You can't control it.", "I hate those things!  They are so restrictive.  I wish I could remember the name of the medication that my friend is on that helped her...let me check with her and see if she texts me back.", "Don't feel any shame.  The medication is called Topomax.  It supposedly stops the receptors in the brain that trigger night sleep eating.  I also know that if you happen to take Ambien,a sleeping pill, go off of it because it actually can cause night sleep eating. Take care!", "Ugh! They do that here too! Are you in a bad city too?", "Did you find out who did it?", "Oh really, I was unaware of that.", "That is quite interesting.", "Yes they do, I just hate spending money if I don't have too. I have a kirby but it needs to be fixed and I don't know how to do it. So I found a great deal on a new one until then. Can't wait to get cleaning! I like to clean weirdly...", "Oh yes! If only I could buy one whenever one got worn out lol", "That sounds really dramatic! What's the matter? What's making you so unsure about it?", "I can understand trying to abide by one's intuition... Are you going on your flight to somewhere where you have something important to do or someone to meet? Perhaps it may be unfair to them or that situation if you don't go through with it. If you want to do it, try your best to think of all the repercussions, and to weigh the pros and cons, and to not let your intuition cloud your judgment.", "I think it's an adjustment you have to work through. Toddlers can really test anyone's patience!", "It's really hard, especially being thrown into an environment with a two year old and not having them for a consistent basis from when they were younger up until now.", "Oh! I hear you, I love them but I get sick when I eat them. Did you do okay?", "That's unusual. Are you allergic to something they are fried in or just potatoes in general? I have digestive issues so I get tired too when I eat junk food", "That's terrible! Sorry to hear that.", "So do I. People need to be more considerate of others.", "Well, sometimes we can feel that way in life. Relieved because there isn't drama, but get a bit lonely. Maybe you can get out and meet some new people?", "Well, whatever makes you happy, that's what you should do. But, still, never hurts to at least have platonic friends :)", "Congrats to him!  What type of skating?", "Oh, now I understand.  He is skateboarding. ", "Oh no. Have you been stressed about anything?", "You sound nervous.", "I don't blame you. It can be scary...the more people there are- the worse they drive. Be careful!", "For sure! And always check for the wreckless drivers and the ones who cut you off- Thats really bad in bigger cities. Can never be too careful.", "Very true! That is why everyone does different things. Very complex to keep it going! I was researching neurofeedback today and it's nice to see how much some doctors care about helping.", "Well..I have had some terrible experiences with doctors as have many but there are some who do care about helping.", "That's an interesting thing to know! Have you thought about doing it as a hobby?", "If it makes you feel peace of happiness, definitely!", "Oh hey! A fellow bird feeder. Did you eventually get some?", "That's good. Sometimes we forget to do things that matter to us.", "Oh yes, I've been poor most of my life. It's nice to be able to get something if you need it.", "Two incomes and a decent paying job. I am doing a business on the side so I don't have to be poor anymore. It's not very much fun.", "Oh man, the flu in summer?1", "Oh geez! Was it a quick flu", "Wow! Great wife, Cherish her! Stack up on good vitamin C and good Elderberry when you're well to keep the flu away :)\\", "Oh god...lol- I HATE being sick...When I get sick..it's BAD- So let's hope lol", "That is great you showed the initiative to apply.  It is common to be a bit nervous.", "Just think positive thoughts and I am sure you will get the news shortly", "That sounds relaxing! How was the weather?", "I love when everything just seems to work out together. Im glad you enjoyed!", "That is really good.  In this economic climate it is good to have something like that to count on.  What do you do?", "That's great.  I am glad you're doing well.", "I am so so sorry to hear that. ", "I know this is so hard for you but he is in no more pain and I am sure he is watching over you", "I asked my mother where she left my drawing, she said she threw it out.", "I was younger and i spent all day.", "Thats exciting! where are you going??", "Is that a country? i know the name but not the geography.", "Oh no!!  That is awful.  I hope you are okay :(", "I bet.  Nothing is worse than losing a friend suddenly like that.   Keep your head up, friend.", "Yeah it was!  He caught a large bass!  He did so well :D", "It was pretty fun.  He did a good job!  Hope we go again soon.", "That is awful. I would definitely not pay and never go back again.", "They will lose a lot of business over that one. Word of mouth is the best way to hurt someone. That is gross and I wouldn't go back either.", "That is so wonderful!  I have the same kind of husband.  Aren't we lucky?  It gives me hope for when my daughter grows up and finds someone.", "Oh wow, your daughter is a lot closer than mine whose just 8.  I already worry about it.  I know they'll find some upstanding men but they can take their time in finding them! ha ha.", "Glad you made it, what happened to almost be short?", "That was very nice of your grandma. How much did she cover?", "I know. It was so shocking and sad.", "That was a great movie!", "Oh you know, because of people. They try and get you down. I have been around a misery loves company type. I am really trying to hold on to that feeling no matter what. It's hard!", "So true! The right people mean everything.", "OHHH! Those are nice! How much was it if you don't mind me asking?", "Great! That is how it should work. Not one guy making a ton more, as it takes everyone to make it work :)", "No. I just kicked someone out. It's different living alone. Peaceful though. But hard.", "Yes and Yes. They need help. I am not their punching bag. ", "Sorry?", "No problem! I have done it before. Oh wow! That sounds nice, are they still together? I hope.", "Understandable. But remember there are always private things. No relationship is perfect. It takes both working hard", "Congratulations! That is awesome!  I don't really have much luck in winning things.  Have you won anything else before in your life?", "That is so cool. I have been drooling over an iPad!  Is it amazing??", "Oh man, good luck! Make sure to have a book/music on hand at least to help distract you", "I think that would help. Is it for vacation?", "I have never seen any of the new Star Wars movies.", "I have not been to the movies in a long time. It is very expensive to go these days.", "I'm so sorry, were they impressed?", "I would imagine they were quite delighted.", "I totally feel for her. I have lost many the past year. It's hard", "That was nice of you. Having company helps through grief.", "Has something changed lately?", "That is a very good attitude that you have!", "What was the exam for?", "When will you get the results for this exam?", "I hate the dentist. It always makes me nervous. Are you going for a checkup?", "Oh no :( That sucks. I hope it's only one", "Oh that is fantastic!!!  I bet you're proud of him!", "That's pretty cool!  You sound like an awesome grandparent! :D", "No lol.  He's actually better at it than I am!  I didn't catch anything", "haha.  I doubt he ever will!  That turd!", "that sounds like a nice sunday", "hopefully it happens again soon!", "wow thats a huge pain", "i know what you mean", "I hope so! I hate driving but good luck.", "Good, that's really important thing.", "I do feel confident about it.  We haven't met in person yet, but she is coming to visit me in Nigeria tom", "Thank you.", "I'm sorry.  It sounds like you had a tough life.", "I could not have said it better myself.", "Oh lord, why did you do that?", "You pay your gramma back and stop drinking. Seriously", "How are you ready?", "What kinds of snacks do you have for it?", "How did he win a lot of money?", "Does he play the scratcher tickets a lot?", "oh yea something else insane?", "that makes no sense.", "O that sounds delicious, any idea what you'll get?", "Sounds delicious, get some queso too!", "Oh so many things. Lots of trauma. Life really is just full of lots of really difficult events..trying to maintain your spirit and being a good person through it, is really the task of life!", "Thank you! I have tried..it's been a VERY traumatic year in so many ways..and I didn't think it could get any worse a few years ago..Wrong! I hear you with pain! Please try every treatment you can. DIET plays a HUGE role- also chiropractor, Nuerofeedback, Different herbs! I found eating right, exercising, herbs, vitamins, organic food helped with my pain caused by doctors- I had tons of neuropathy, pain and fibro like symptoms in addition to the trauma of deaths, abuse etc. I hope YOU feel better and YOU inspire me right now that I don't have it so bad!!!", "THANK YOU! That sounds GREAT! yes the raw groups on FB have good diets too! I need to do vegan as well! Just can't afford it yet. Doing Fasting with Keto WOW- That is true! I just feel tapped out after so much abuse and trauma..and losing pets and children..Just too much trauma in a short time, but I am still here! I am trying to get better, it's just a long hard journey. LOVE to you! Stay strong and kind like you are! So inspiring!", "I hear you! It's sad yet happy to think of how great it was years ago! I hope we get to keep our good memories when we leave this world", "I know right <3. Such a great time when we weren't the adults as well! lol- Paying bills is no fun.", "I tried to do a break dancing move that I used to be able to do, but that was 20 years ago.  I'm lucky my pants are the only thing that busted!  Hahahaha.", "Rented tuxedo, so It will probably end up costing me pretty big.", "Yeah!  I've never been on one.  We're taking the kids though.", "LOL no I'm the uncle!!  Oh well.  Maybe it's time I try it!  What do you think?", "Alrighty then!  Maybe I'll give it a shot!  ", "You are very lucky you didn't crash your car while driving.", "Yes, how much did it cost to fix the tire?", "it looks like it's going to be good!", "Me too... those are my favorite type of movies", "Oh goodness, what happened?", "Oh no, you must be devastated.  I'm sorry.", "Ohh gosh! What happened. That's so terrifying", "Oh, I feel sorry for you.", "Thats good, do yall live in the same town?", "my mother lives far away, and I live with my father, but its not ideal", "Oh my god that\u2019s hilarious. ", "Oh no I am so sorry about that. Did everything turn out ok?", "Oh, what caused them to move out?  Is that a good thing or a bad thing?", "I see. I'm sorry you're home alone.  I get lonely myself when you're used to someone around.  Are you going to advertise for a new roommate?", "Do you have any children already or will this be your first?", "Do you know if it is a boy or girl?", "That is irritating, huh.  It is like a kid that can't stand not having the attention for a minute so they act up.  Haha", "It just wants you off the phone instead.  ", "I hope you didn't drink the soup. They better of given you the meal for free.", "Oh, I thought it was a t a restaurant.", "Nah.  Don't worry my friend!  It will be okay!", "I don't think they will.  We are the worlds greatest army", "Not sure yet.  Last year he played center.  I'm sure he will do good whatever he plays this year.", "Yeah he's really tall.  Last year he was the biggest kid on the team in 8th grade lol", "My little brother always plays electric guitar. And that's too irritating.", "Yes. You are right!", "Where did you go? You went alone?", "That is awesome, I've been there when I was a kid and had a lot of fun!", "I'm a political science major, yeah I know, not the best choice.", "Struggling but doing ok I guess, just got to pay off my debt.", "That's not good, what is the contract dispute about?", "Yeah, that's always rough. I would take them to court if it's in the 4 digit range.", "I haven't been.  I would really love to go, and it's good to hear such a good review from someone.", "What else is there to do there other than see the falls?", "Good for YOU! Integrity is very rare nowadays", "I feel the same way!", "No, I am not a big crier.  It was hard to see but they were good memories.", "Ok?", "That is wonderful!  How many kids do you have?  That's a tough job but so rewarding!", "I have 2 kids.  I love being home with them as well. I am blessed to be able to work at home.  I also homeschool them and love teaching! Are you having any more kids?", "That is awesome!  How long were they away ", "I am so happy for you!", "Great! What kind of job is it?", "Sounds great! Better pay is always good!", "I am! It always comes at the right time sometimes.", "Oh pet food, groceries and bills! lol- Whatever it will cover :)", "I would not want to be in your position it's ok to help but all the time it can be dreadful. ", "It will get better put your foot down and maybe say no in a nice way to not step on any ones toes.", "That's awesome! congratulations too!  What do you do?", "Oh nice! My brother in law is a lawyer and I remember him trying to get certain jobs he wanted and it not being easy sometimes.  Sounds like you are a great lawyer.  Hope it goes well for you!", "Wow congrats! What type of music do you play?", "Nice, I really like folk music. I hope you guys put off a great show.", "Oh what a scene. How did it make you feel?", "You are so lucky to have a family like that!", "oh my lord, please say thats not true.", "that is one of the most horrible things ive ever heard.", "I would be mad! Did she say why she didn't bring you anything?", "Maybe you could talk to her after you calm down a bit.  I'm sure there is a reason.", "Aw I'm sorry.  Why are you lonely?", "Maybe you could invite a friend over for a movie?", "Maybe you could facetime your wife.", "That sounds really frustrating! Who mows their lawn that early holy cow!", "Wow I would be mad to. ", "Gee, that is too bad. I wonder why Becky got it and you didn't?", "Yeah, that's no fun. Maybe you'll get offered the next promotion that is available? ", "What day is that?", "Oh lord..that gives me chills just hearing the word. What was it on?", "Oh yes, that is his nickname though! We call him \"white dog\".", "No he's black. Just kidding ;)", "Just taking a vacation to the beach.  Not very excited about the 9 hour drive though.", "Yeah I guess I'll have to do that.  I hate long trips.  Thanks for the tip!", "Oh that's awful!  I hope he is going to be okay.  Did they lay him off with severence or anything?", "Yeah.  He will get to spend more time with you all now!  Take the father on a vacation!", "I lad you was ok did anyone help you or was you embarrassed? ", "Now that was mean and cruel nothing funny about that best outcome is you are fine be careful next time.", "Oh boy.  That's no good.  Did the credit card company alert you or did they miss it too?", "I bet.  I can't believe they didn't alert you.  Were they able to take care of it for you and suspend the charges and the account?", "Oh goodness, is she okay?", "I really wish the best for y'all.  Good health.", "That was nice of him. You should take him out for dinner.", "That is impossible thou. It is a dog eat dog world out there.", "Congratulations. Do you have any party planned for this event?", "That is cool. Are you going alone or with friends?", "Thats hard to do if you live with them lol. I get that we all can once in awhile..but incessantly day in and out no matter WHAT way things go...so either way? That's a problem.", "It's my house, why would I move out ;)", "Oh! Yeah I understand that, maybe they will take you?!", "Oh yes of course! I am sorry.", "That's so nice. Is he doing better now?", "I'm sure it was a great comfort to you. Food is a great way to tell someone you care. ", "That's great. My mother is like that too, and it's easy take for granted, but not all are so lucky !", "You sure are! At least you appreciate and acknowledge so I'm sure she is pretty glad to have you as her child.", "Yes, all the time! My girlfriend always thinks I'm so weird.", "I'm sorry to hear that. We all have our demons. Sometimes it's good to take one day at a time and try to stay positive. ", "Good to hear! What is the subject?", "That's something to be proud of! Good job!", "I'm not sure what that is. Tell me about it?", "Oh, okay, I believe I know what you are talking about now. He is a good actor and usually his movies are great!", "I hope you wasn't to disappointed was you to going to spend time together? ", "A simple call would have been nice hopefully he has a good explanation for this. ", "Can you really put a price on pizza?", "I understand,  If a pizza is more than 10 dollars, im not paying.", "That must be so annoying.", "I'm sorry, maybe one day when he gets older.", "Oh no! I hope you didn't have to go anywhere the next day? Did you try anything to help?", "Oh, well that's a bonus! No one needs sleep on christmas lol", "Can't you just live with someone?", "Well, dogs are good for protection.", "No, but I had to sweep it up quickly before my mom found out. ", "No", "Oh no!  Its always tough in relationships but when you can't go see her or make her talk to you afterwards, I'm sure its extra hard.  Did you call back and tell her that?", "I'm sure once she calms down, she will look on it as not as big of a deal.  If you have to work, you have to work.  I hope you can work it out!  ", "Hahaha. I'm so sorry, but that made me laugh. I really don't mean to make you feel like I'm thinking you're dumb, because I don't. Everyone makes that mistake. I have an old Honda Civic, and I run into that problem, too. You probably gave the locksmith a good story to tell, and made his day. Hopefully you can smile at it tomorrow.", "Oh man, he didn't charge you? You both kind of won then! A good story for you both at no cost. Well, except for time. It was a good learning lesson. And yeah.. the bumper sticker.. that's crazy. I'm glad you're able to not take yourself so seriously. That makes for a great personality.", "Oh, well, I guess that was a bit disappointing huh. Well, maybe you can go real soon.", "Oh, well, you're going to have to say, \"Mom, I know you're tired but I really want to see this movie, can we please just go? It'll be fun, we need time together\".", "I understand.  Tell me about it.", "Yes, one day at a time.", "Woo hoo! What were you promoted too?", "That's great! What kind of tasks do you do?", "That's an interesting way to get attention. What spurred that on? Was it a dare, or was he just feeling wild?", "Interesting.. Did he get in trouble? Was this at a high school or something? And does he take gymnastics?! Back flips are hard!", "In the early days of our relationship, we did. But then we matured in life and in our relationship, and our communication did improve a little. But I feel like she's so rash and overreactionary and sensitive at times.I want to put off arguments until we cool off, and she wants to have them immediately. We clash sometimes when it comes to perspectives.", "We have relatively the same political views. It's never about that kind of stuff. It's more personal stuff. The next fight will probably be better if she isn't as tired. We'll see.", "I'm really sorry to hear that. What's worse is the best thing for breakups, the only thing that really helps, is time passing by. But the people who are hurting, in the moment, they can't really understand or accept that. So, you feel like you have to help and do something, when in reality it's probably best you don't smother them and that they have space. I hope she feels better, though.", "Yeah, that's a good idea. That's always a solid way to go about it. My roommate had a breakup 6 months ago. I tried not to give any advice that was too specific, because the best solution always has to come from that person themselves. My roommate ended up just focusing on himself as much as possible, diving into artistic endeavors, trying to work out, etc.", "That is disappointing. Did you confront them about it? I am sorry you have to deal with that.", "That's too bad. Lesson learned, I guess.", "That sounds stressful! How far did you move?", "That's quite a ways. Do you have any hobbies that could help you meet new people?", "Well, that's wonderful and I know it really is so great to hear your child's first words!", "For Sure. Before you know it, he'll be saying full sentences!", "That is always true. The saying goes..water your own grass.", "Find some good books and good therapy and make your life what you want it to be. If you truly love your partner then don't lose them over feelings. Feelings are fleeting.", "Yeah, I do. I'm in a long distance relationship. I get that everytime I have to fly back home. I hope you start to feel better, though. Loneliness can end up being a good motivator, however.", "Ah, your situation sounds complicated. I'm sorry you have to deal with that. It sounds like you've given a lot of thought though, and the way you lay it out, you sound very mature about it. You've developed a good perspective on it, one that I should learn to appreciate myself. With your temperament, I'm sure you won't suffer from loneliness very long. People will want to be around you, as long as you want them around you.", "You sound like you've dealt with more hardship than the average person. I wish I could empathize with you, but I've been lucky to avoid that kind of thing recently. But I do hope things will turn out differently for you soon. If anything, these things will make you more resilient than the average person, too. That's not worth nothing.", "Do you feel their weight?", "Sounds exciting. Will you do it again?", "Are they usually a winning team?", "Oh wow,  I hope they do well.  ", "Wow, that must be scary to have to trust someone else with all of your stuff. What took you out of the country?", "A two month vacation sounds amazing! I figured it was for work or something when you said two months. What is your favorite thing to do in the Bahamas?", "That is worrisome but also exciting. Is it your first child?", "Congratulations. I wish you the best of luck. Parenthood is a blessing.", "That sucks, how old was the goldfish?", "What did you do with Goldie after she died?", "Aw.  I bet that is so bittersweet. Do they graduate next May?", "That is a good sign!  I know many kids that age who have no direction so it sounds like he's really going places.  Do you have any other kids that will still be at home?", "What is the certification exam for?", "My father was an architect. So I have heard about these exams.", "I hear you! Life is SO busy, never enough hours in the day!", "Oh lol! It's ok, you are a mom and it's the hardest job EVER and very thankless. You are doing good", "Yes I do hate being all alone. That's how I feel when my boyfriend leaves town for work.", "Yes you have to do what is best for yourself. Take care of you before others.", "Right on, that sounds cool. Did you go with family, or a date? Or maybe just hung out there alone? That's okay, too. I love Italian food, had always wanted to go to Olive Garden, but my dad hates Italian. So when we were growing up, we just never went. Now that I'm on my own, I've been... twice. Both times, they were just okay.", "It can be cheap to go there sometimes for an easy filling meal, with the deals and coupons they have, I think. With the bread and soup you can get. I hope you guys had a good time! ", "I'm sorry the hear that.  Maybe another company would appreciate your talent.", "The first job out of college is a good way to test the waters but someday you will have to spread those wings.", "Just take your time and don't get so nervous you got this. ", "Great to have some hands on help parallel parking is very hard but once down packed it is easy.", "That's ok.  Employers don't look at your grades I don't think.", "It sounds like you have determination, and that is worth more than a 4.0", "Yeah it should be a good one. Who is your favorite team?", "Hope Dak has a good year! I am all about the tailgating.", "That must have been somewhat weird.", "Oh goodness, that is so creepy!", "That sounds so exciting get ready for sleepless nights and long nights gambling. ", "Know your limit once you start gambling it will make it much easier so you won't go broke.", "I'm sorry, but I don't envy you... I've always just driven a little sedan. I'm an alright driver, but if I had to drive something bigger, I'd be nervous, too. Too easy for me to make mistakes. I kind of dread the day where I'll have to drive a big Uhaul truck. I hope things go well for you, though.", "Well, as long as you're patient and careful, you'll minimize your mistakes. There are those who go out there and think they know everything. Even if they're a good driver, they may be more likely to slip up and have a problem than you would. So, just stay positive!", "Maybe you can observe what she's doing and use that to advance in the industry as well.", "I'd be worried about having these kinds of feelings towards your wife.", "That does sound creepy. What did you do?", "Clowns are scary. Did you make it out safe?", "Oh that is pretty cool. Were there any clowns there?", "That is good to hear. I like the ones that are funny better.", "Did it turn out to be a great event even though the bands was unknown? ", "That is good to hear I would enjoy a night with some great music. ", "That sounds scary! What was it?", "Oh no. Are there other people at home with you?", "That was nice of them. What movie do you want to see?", "You should see 8th grade. Nice story about a girl growing up. You will like it.", "That is very impressive. Do you know what languages they are?", "wow, I bet Chinese is one the State Department really needs right now. I hope your friend gets the job.", "Wow. You can wear yoga pants to work? I'd like that dress code!", "Ah I'm glad that's over for you then. Now you're less likely to forget doing laundry again.", "Oh no, are you worried about her? Do you think she will be faithful?", "Yes I agree, guys are a little let reliable sometimes. ", "Wow. That is impressive! I can't even do a cartwheel on a mat.", "Maybe she is part kangaroo afterall.", "That", "AH-HEM! What I meant to say prior to my keyboard malfunction was...that sounds really neat! Where are you going to go camping?", "People really need to be more respectful. What did you do?", "He deserved it, that scumbag.", "That is scary. I hope she wasn't too shaken up from it.", "That is very true. Well I am glad she is OK. Thanks for sharing about it.", "It must be nerve wrecking especially since it has so much impack on your job.", "Try to stay calm and do your best. Good luck!", "That sounds exciting! When are you going?", "It's good to focus, but surely you can take a few hours to take in the culture.  China has a long and interesting history.", "i hate that!", "hahaha...aww..cant give away the pupper", "That's too bad. What's Your favorite dish?", "Those are really good. I am more of a burrito man myself.", "thats amazing! where did they take you?", "you are very lucky,  is greek your favorite food?", "That is awesome. Did you get to do anything fun with her?", "Cool I like Harry Potter. You have a really nice aunt!", "Congratulations! Any plans to lose more?", "that's great. were you losing for a special occasion or just to feel better?", "Oh.. i am so sorry to hear that my friend.. I understand your feelings. Have you thought about getting a new pet?", "I feel you.. When my pet dunken passed away, i got a new dog, named him dunken and restarted our relationship from there", "That's awesome! And crazy... And scary... and awesome all at once! You must kinda feel accomplished though, huh? Good to hear that everyone is happy and healthy. Kind of weird how you all will have that special, unique bond for the rest of your lives, now. ", "It's funny, you guys walked into work that day and thought it'd be another usual, boring day. You clocked out maybe with some blood on your shirt, smelling like newborn. Awesome.", "Wow. I definitely would take it up wiht your credit card.", "They really should be more considerate. allergies are a serious medical concern.", "What happened? Did you ask her to go out on a date?", "Yeah, that happens all the time with me. Well, actually, it doesn't, since I can't text because I wear Hulk Hands all the time. I just smash things.", "Wow. Why did he do that?", "If he wasn't happy with the food, there arebetter ways to tell you.", "Not sure what an emu is. I hope you find him/her!", "Maybe she just wanted to go play. I hope she comes back.", "That really sucks. That would have been an instance to cry over SPILLED milk indeed!", "Never thought about that. Thank god you recovered it!", "that is awesom!!!", "hahaah...thats too cute", "Aw, that's so sweet of you. Did it work?", "That's really nice. The world needs more people like you.", "damn dog , thats disappointing to here ", " i would be really angry", "Sounds impressive. Did you finish all of them?", "That's really good! Did they give you a raise?", "Nice! How is your business doing nowadays?", "That's really great. I am proud of your success.", "oh my lord! only ten?", "I think you can do it! I mean is there really a limit to the amount of bigmacs one can eat?", "Oh that sounds wonderful! Are you going to visit the zoo?", "I here they have one of the best zoos in the us.", "That's really bad, but really good that your faced didn't turn out scarred for life. ", "True. It is quite terrible to have acne. Mine is so bad that I can't even see.", "That's so nice of them. Was it your birthday?", "I'm glad you had such a fun time.", "awww thats good news!", "im sure the pupper was happy!", "That's awesome! I hope you get the good news soon.", "Early congratulations to ya!", "thats awesome , and happy birthday !!!", "what kind of gifts did you get ?", "That's really good for you. What kind of job do you have?", "That sounds like a really neat job. Are you going to get a promotion soon?", "Yeah I'm pumped!  I can't wait to go to some of his games!", "Sure will!  I hope they win every game!", "lol.  Maybe you should talk to them about it!", "Yeah I understand.  Maybe you should pay them back by interrrupting them?", "That's too bad. Do you have a new job lined up?", "I hope you find one soon. If you don't, you are more than welcome to come work in my sweatshop in Siberia.", "Oh that must be such a relief.", "Did the little guy even feel guilty for running away?", "You cannot enjoy bowling all alone. It is a group game. Don't you have any friends to invite?", "What happened? Is it something because of you or him?", "I have a Chase credit card. They really aren't that great, but I do hope you get approved. Why do you need it?", "That sounds like a smart plan. When do you find out?", "that is such a sweet story.. congrats to both of you", "it is so nice to see a marriage as strong these days!", "That sounds awesome.

It was a really nice relaxing weekend!", "Yeah you should go there!  Or any lake/camping area near where you live.  You would have a great time too!", "Wow. It can be difficult to put together but finding the parts is a lot of fun.", "I think if you show that you put in some effort yourself first she won't mind.", "Wow. You were either very imaginative or upset.", "Thought that reminded me of Death Note, but I think L only focused on criminals.", "I know its bad, but I went out eith some new friends who probably wouldn't get her like I do", "I don't want to be friend with them either so I guess its okay.", "Thats good. Where did they find it?", "Is that how much doritos and a mountain dew costs there. geez", "thats the same thing happening at my job , super lazy worker just walks around and hides in the restroom its annoying", "yes it does, i wish people like that would just get fired ", "That is horrible.

That's unfortunate...did you guys reconcile?", "That's great to have that kind of support!", "I think so.  Generally getting more or less than what you deserve to get is unbalanced.", "I can understand that.  Hopefully everything works out in the end though.", "Im sorry! Are you going to be ok?", "I bet. It stinks that that is happening to you", "Yeah that's terrible. is you cat fixed?", "That might be why she does it. It's something to consider.", "oh no, that's bad :( what did you lie about?", "that's not good :( so i bet your wife asked you if you give him something and you said no? you should tell her", "Been there myself, the anticipation can really get to you.

That must make you sad.", "Glad there's hope for you.", "Will they be improving by alot?", "Wow, that's a whole bunch right there. Congrats!", "Sometimes he is just trying to be helpful, and hand me things.  I think sometimes he just gets too excited to be helpful, and clocks me in the face.", "I don't know how many times I'm going to have to tell him not to throw things though!", "Whoa!

Are you doing better now?", "I feel you. We were in a similar situation last year, but things have started looking up.", "It is truly horrible.

That is very frustrating! Can you speak with a supervisor about the situation?", "I don't blame you, I would talk to him.

It's the best when you get to fall asleep to them.", "I live near the coast, and we have hurricane scares all the time. For some reason, people love to stay behind and just face the storm. They're fearless and think everything will be okay, even when sometimes it's not. I guess they're just determined to stay by their homes and not abandon them, which I can understand. I'll hope for the best for you!", "I've never had the guts to do that, even though I've wanted to on multiple occasions. What happened, if you don't mind me asking?", "That's the worst...

I don't want to sound cruel but at least this could maybe be a period of your life where you can just focus on you and improve a lot of areas of your life. You could look at it like a second chance.", "Yeah, that happened to my roommate recently. I didn't try to give him too much specific advice, because most of it is just useless.

I don't think I could do that in one night - you must be a good baker.", "Man, I'm jealous! I'm still a college student, barely paying rent! And nothing but student loans to look forward to. I probably should have taken your path in life. Not to say you haven't worked very hard for it, because I'm sure you have.", "Hey I really appreciate that advice. I need to take it. I'm horrible at setting goals. I just move in a general direction. I need to break things down step by step. We'll see how it goes.", "Yeah, and you can never turn your back on family, even if they completely complicate your life.. It's a no-win situation. The kids probably prefer to stay in the original situation, even though it's not healthy and safe, because they just don't understand.. just a big head ache. I'll do what I can, but who knows how much that will be.", "I hear you. You got a good attitude. I wish for the best for you.

I'm sure you are just fine for someone else. She didn't deserve you.", "Okay, yeah a lot of people seem to have that problem. Maybe you can learn from it for next time.", "So, the women only like you because you have money?", "Well, on paper you are like a dream catch, no doubt about it.", "Do you mean \"out\" of control", "Yes I'd agree with you. I still think it's hilarious that he's president...didn't think know Republicans had such a scarce lineup", "Pretty good!  I remain loyal to her through thick and thin!", "Yeah back in my younger days I would've been a little more promiscuous but not now!  She's worth it!", "Hey that's awesome!  What kind of job is it?", "Oh.  Wait.  What?", "It's easy to be intimidated by pretty girls.", "You really don't, I agree.", "Oh my,  do you ever geta  weird feeling when it looks at you?", "That is crazy! maybe its you from the future!", "That sound like a lot of fun!

You are a great owner.", "Yes, animals are our best friends.", "Well it is natural, maybe bad food choice?", "Oh you shouldn't be. Don't eat before church though ;)", "god it repaired ?", "thats cool.", "Yeah, I wouldn't get too down. Statistically, there's not much of a chance of ever winning.", "Yes I agree. I would be amazing to win the lottery.", "It's good to always try and think positive.", "That is a great attitude to have. It would be nice if more people saw it like that.", "Congrats on getting him that far! What did he study?", "Thats a great job to have in this world.

Makes it so you don't have to keep hardcopy photo albums anymore! ", "I feel you man. Seeing pictures of my baby son tears me right up.", "That's really nice of her!  Was there a special occasion or anything?", "Dang, kind of reminds me I should probably do something nice for my wife...", "That's unfortunate. What type of exam do you have?", "How ironic. Unable to study finances because you're at work making your own.", "Oh no, what's up?", "The anticipation must be crazy.", "Nice! What kind of cake was it?", "Those cakes are really good! I believe they are made of dried milk.", "Was it planned?", "That's terrible.

I've gotta see this guy then.", "How unprofessional of your professor to say that!

I wonder how they even saw that the grass needed to be cut living in darkness.", "Well, at least he/she feels better now? Sorry about your shoes.", "Wow. I didn't know shoes could cost that much!", "Wow, that's quite the career leap! What made you do it?", "That makes sense to me. Money doesn't always equate to happiness.

That is quite a unique first word!", "Yes or when they try and bait you.  It is hard to not be an enabler sometimes. It requires a LOT of strength and tough love.", "Yes actually they are away and I have to be silent...as they just fight with me no matter what..so while it's hard for me to shut them out- I have too right now until they get better-", "I know how you feel! I don't have carpet in my living room for that reason- Sometimes they have accidents. I hate poo accidents especially!", "Oh yes, best to have her not alone ever during this time.", "Was it yours or the bank's fault?", "If it was the bank's mistake, even if you didn't have enough money, they're responsible for fixing it.", "That's perfection.

Did you guys play on it a lot together?", "That's cool, I don't know the first thing about building my own pc.", "Did he/she say something you may disagree with?", "That sounds unprofessional. I thought they were supposed to sound neutral.", "I didn't know such a thing existed! What store?", "Oh! That's a nice program. Well getting any amount of groceries for free is nice, but yes too bad it wasn't a supermarket sweep", "Oh many things, I guess it manifests in making everything get on my nerves. I hope I feel better tomorrow because I hate being in a bad mood ever.", "Thank you! So kind- I am trying!", "Was it Domino's pizza?", "Because I love Domino's so that's the only pizza I think of!", "Oh who was there?!", "Oh sweet. How's the new phone?", "That would really annoy me! Did you end up taking any action against them? I know some companies will tow a vehicle that does that.", "Man, the nerve on some people. I would never take somebody's spot if they have a sign up for it!", "What a glutton. Did he happen to have a mountain of crab legs?", "Man, I feel bad for his stomach. It's probably as worn out and bloated as my great granddad.", "50?  That might be a world record or something.  How did you find out?", "I guess he learned his lesson.  Only eat 25.  ha ha.", "I agree, I loved that show so much when I was little.", "I agree, what's your favorite?", "Yes..but it's even harder on the caregivers... I felt very compassionate for them today though ...as here they are working hard again. The rollercoaster is not easy...I feel sad for them today.", "Caregivers mean anyone who takes care of them..In this case me.", "Are you in trouble?", "Well they can be, but make sure you buy it next time.

I wonder what that kind of bite feels like. Did it hurt?", "Right, have to train them not to I suppose, if at all possible.", "That is good. When do you have the exam?", "Good luck.", "Dang. Why don't you just get your own?", "That's reasonable. Just make sure you get your own when you have the funds available.", "That sounds like a lot of fun. What do you do now?", "Oh so sorry to hear that. Well maybe you can round them up for something.", "I completely agree!  I am all about keeping the earth clean, recycling, and low waste living.  They should get bigger fines!", "I'm right with you.  Oh, cigarette butts gross me out, not to mention second hand smoke which has been found to cause cancer too.", "Nope!

Maybe she can come with you?", "That sounds about right for the bus station, unfortunately. How did everyone react when they saw it?", "Wow. I hope you don't ever have to see anything like that again!", "Haha, I wouldn't worry about it. There is much worse things you can do. Unless you're doing something you shouldn't be doing online!", "Yeah, well maybe you can offer to pay for half of it instead?", "That's terrible! Did you say anything about it?", "Yeah, I would be too. Hopefully they'll invite you in the future.", "Oh no, is it a young dog or an older one?", "Right, puppies are like that. It took mine a year and a half before they weren't having any more accidents like that.", "It's really nice that you feel that way, even though you wanted it. Think you'll get it next time?", "Well, it certainly sounds like you deserve it. You sound like a good person.", "That's awesome. Debt really is an awful thing.", "Glad all that hard work paid off for ya. I aspire to get there someday myself.", "Oh wow, that's great.  What unit are you in now and what made you want to change?", "That's awesome.  Are you a nurse?  I used to work in the NICU.  It was a wonderful job.  Good luck with your new position.", "Wow! That is pretty amazing IMO..unless she isn't good with kids..My first almost killed me..and I am terrified to do it again..", "Aw well, as long as she is a good mom, more power too her :) Children are great fun.", "I am not sure why...but ever since my body changed so much in pregnancy..and I am having to work so hard to get it back to normal..somedays I am just uncomfortable and don't want to wear anything and I don't want to go out", "I have! It is just something different after you get pregnant..and I was very sick and had a lot of health issues..I have lost most of the weight- It just changes you and your body for some of us-", "Did you at least study?", "ok", "Months so I was great that I was finally able to do it.", "Great because it took a long time to learn.", "Must've been a good burp.", "Must've gave them a good chuckle. Don't worry. They'll get over it.", "Oh man. Was she mad?", "Dang. Well, I am sure you won't make that mistake in the future!", "I bet.  I love fast food soooo much.  What did you have?", "It really does.  I feel your pain on the no wheat policy.  I used to eat fast food all of the time and now I am a no wheat no oil vegan, so No fast food.", "I'm not celiac, but I just eat whole food plant based.  It has been hard for me because I also hate vegetables (not good for a vegan) but I drink a lot of fresh vegetable juices and whole food smoothies to get the nutrients in.  I feel so much better now, though, that I can't go back.  Check out the Happy Pear on youtube, they have great vegan recipes.", "I am very sorry to hear all of that, it is a little more expensive, but I found I feel so much better I can actually work more o make up the difference.  Check out Dr. Michael Greger, too if you haven't he is a great resource as well.", "Oh no!! When did this happen?", "Oh, I feel you! I used to be a food addict as well when I was younger. It is a hard habit to break! It's amazing how far you have come though! So many don't realize that fresh real food make a difference and you feel so good when you get real nutrition!", "That's too bad! Do you know if you can buy a new one before the show?", "Yea, maybe you can find an alternative. I lost a few shirts over the years before too, it's no fun.", "I wouldn't be able to keep a surprise like that!", "Sounds like you're ready to go!", "Wow, that's quite the shift! Did you have any difficulties leaving things behind you?", "Best of luck to you, I hope everything works out great in the end!", "Was the dog upset about something or was he/she just telling you whose boss?", "She probably bad mouthed you while out there.", "That's too bad. Maybe she will find a new one soon.", "That's always a plus. I am sure that will make the search less stressful.", "Is the dog potty trained?", "That's why I don't have carpeting.", "That's really nice! Did you guys reconnect?", "It's always great to reconnect to old friends.", "I was afraid that there was a monster under my bed!", "It is! I am so glad I grew out of it.", "That is really mean. Why does she do it?", "I would too if my wife did that. It's alright, man.", "That's unfortunate! What style food did your favorite restaurant serve?", "Dim sum, huh? I haven't heard of that before. What exactly is that?", "Where did you take her?", "What did she eat on your date?", "I'm sorry to hear that. Are you saving more?", "Yea. You should definitely hold off on buying a new car for now.", "Oh my god!! she must have been raised in a barn!", "Like a bathroom maybe!  some people really just dont understand manners.", "Haha, that's funny you mention that. I seen the same thing happen to a girl when I was at the grocery story one time.", "Yeah, it must be a pretty embarrassing moment. Although it's an honest mistake.  ", "You have one as a pet?", "That's great, losing a pet would have been awful.", "Yeah, I sometimes do that as well. But, as long as the bills are getting paid, I guess you can't complain.", "True. But, you can't help stupid people from getting high paying jobs. I am a prime example.", "Is the first time that he ran away?", "Then it is a little bit scary. Did you try to find him?", "That sounds awesome! Have you guys been friends long?", "That's pretty cool. You guys must have a good relationship.

Good luck on your finals!", "Don't forget to get some rest though.", "Nice! What kind of food do they serve?", "That sounds incredibly tasty. I think I will have to go there.", "That's so kind of you!", "aw I'm so happy for it. Do you miss it?", "Wow, that's pretty nice of her. I wish my girlfriend would cook for me!", "Yes she certainly does! I guess she makes up for it in other ways!", "That's awesome! Was it your birthday?", "They sound great! Happy birthday to you!", "I think that's normal. What were you afraid of?", "Must've been really terrifying. What did your parents do?", "That is so sad. What happened to her mom?", "That is really said. I hope that she gets a new mom some day.", "I am sure you did fine. Did you study hard?", "It will be fine!

Congrats ", "That's a good one", "My dad", "lol.

Not your fault, it happens", "Because nobody taught them how to live right.", "Government? No way, it is interested in quite the opposite my friend.", "That is really good of you. Hopefully he doesnt decide to stay at your house forever!", "Nice, I wish I had a friend like that!", "did you just start the job?", "i would also feel lonely", "man that would have scared me too, was it an actual intruder?", "that is too funny but I have done things like that before as well", "Did your younger brother let it out or something like that?", "Yes, this things happen, but as long as you find your dog after, it's alright.", "Why?", "Cool", "Ouch, I am sorry to hear that.

Do you think they would've hurt you if they found you?", "You'd probably be having even more nightmares. I'm glad you're safe, though.", "That's a unique experience to go through. Does she have a nice location picked out for it?", "Cool! That sounds really special and personal. I'm sure they both will really enjoy that!", "That is very nice of your sister!", "Yeah, maybe you should get her a gift of some sort.", "It is so amazing I think you would enjoy it.", "I can't wait to see it!", "I'm sorry to hear that... it sucks being in a \"team\" where no one wants to do anything", "I would confront them about it to avoid it happening again", "That's really exciting!

I love traveling on my off time!", "do you have roomates?", "mine does the exact same thing! i hate it", "Aww that had to be a little disappointing?", "Yeah that can be life changing money! Maybe next time!", "I am so happy for you!", "Old houses are the best.", "As a kid? That's the best!", "Did you go often with your family?", "Oh, what is it?", "That must be so exciting!", "oh no what did she say?", "I would have laughed lol", "You must be so proud. That really is a great accomplishment that he has made. Is he going to college?", "That is so awesome. Does he have a major picked out?", "was it an expensive one?", "awww...still thats upsetting", "Oh no! that's so scary", "haha silly cat!", "Yeah, you can really get in major trouble for doing that.", "I would just not do it again.", "I'm sorry to hear that. Do you know why your neighbor does that to you?", "I think you should just continue talking over your neighbor. Maybe that will get your neighbor to stop.", "His name is chad. Apparently they were childhood friends.", "Probably because I am insecure.", "I can imagine that would be a painful waiting period. Why do you belive she is unfaithful?", "I can see the why you would feel that way. I would be worried too.", "The good news is the chances of actually getting HIV is relatively low. You should not have to worry about it.", "I can imagine it would. You dont need that stress in your life.", "Oh no, did it not turn out the way you planned?", "That's awesome! Hard work always pays off!", "Don't be so negative about it. Maybe you'll really like the person.", "So then just let the person know you can't make it. There's no reason to waste that person's time.", "That's very good of you. I would be proud of myself If I can do such a thing especially if there is a huge chunk of money in it", "I hope he  or she rewarded you though", "That's great!

Have you found a new one yet?", "It seems hard finding a good doctor these days.", "Congrats! It's great to pass your test. Though staying up all night to study may not be the best studying technique.", "That's good. I try to study well in advance. But I find it hard to actually motivate myself.", "haha that's funny! ", "I'm glad you survived lol", "That must be quite nostalgic.", "I miss the old times.", "is it a newer model?", "i would be too", "I'm sorry to hear that. It's really horrible when a friend backs out at the last second.", "There's always scalpers outside of concert venues. That could probably work.", "Wow, what a forward woman.", "Yeah, I'm sure you were.", "lol...thats harsh! are you?", "hahah...that is natural", "That's great you have that kind of confidence.", "That is very responsible of you.", "first of all my condolences for your friend, and i know how hard this is for you both", "ya it feels so weak to be in that place , but you should only give the strength required for your friend to overcome this situation", "you can do it , i pray that you both overcome this situation with peace. ", "That's awful! Maybe you can pay them back?", "Oh wow that's tough. Hopefully they don't know it was you at least.", "I have no idea what to do though. I think I've done every fun thing I can by myself already this week.", "Well I do still want to see \"Jurassic World.\" I haven't gotten the chance yet. Maybe I could meet someone new at the theater!", "Oh yea? why is that?", "I wish there is a way we can make people care more about the environment", "Oh no, im sorry to hear that", "It happens... but you never know their situation and sometimes people make bad financial decisions", "That sounds so disgusting!", "I would have done that too.", "Why she want to divorce? Did she tell you?", "That is terrible. How did you find out?", "Yikes, did you miss a payment?", "It shouldn't have, maybe you need to call customer service and question them as to why.", "I am sure you are beautiful too!", "I wish you had a higher self-esteem.", "We had been trying for over a year when it happened. We thought we would never have another one.", "Thanks. That was 3 years ago now he is a crazy little boy running all over", "I know. I'm just so annoyed at all the time we spent...", "Yeah he got way too nervous and I guess the situation was different than he was expecting.", "i hope all goes well. was something the matter that made you decide to have the tests done?", "always good to check if in doubt", "Oh no I am so sorry! I bet that must have been scary too", "wow they should care more that youre safe!", "I love pizza. What style pizza does the place make?", "Yeah, that sounds very exciting.", "Uhoh I hope you didn't get in trouble?", "Well you can use that feeling to make sure you don't do it again!", "That is terrible. What did you do?", "Well that is a good way to look at it.", "That's great, trust is the backbone of all lasting relationships.", "Of course, we're not meant to lock ourselves away alone for our entire lives.", "That is bad. Did you go to a doctor?", "Then nothing to worry about.", "I do too. It always brings back so many good memories.", "Yes it is. Sometimes I wish you could just go back to that time.", "I am sorry to hear that. Thieves are really crappy people.", "I hope they catch the person and you get your laptop back.", "Oh wow! Are you okay?", "That is insane.  Thank God there was someone there to intervene.", "Oh why is that? Do you play?", "Ah, yeah my husband is the same way. He is very excited.", "Good for him! That's a very valuable skill to have, good on you for teaching him so early.", "Does he seem to enjoy being in the water, or does he resist you a bit?", "Oh I know that feeling actually... Did you ever make up with your friend?", "That's good to hear. It's all water under the bridge now, as they say.", "I believe it is a shark attack movie, so kind of a thriller. ", "Oh yes that is the movie I think. I love them too. Should be fun.", "I love eating there, the food is always amazing.", "I am glad you had such a good meal.", "I hope it wasn't a close friend that lied.", "That is sad.  Liars and thieves are just the worst.", "I don't blame you.  A friend like that isn't a friend at all.  I'm sorry that has happened to you.", "That's embarrassing, but also funny. How did your date react?", "That is awesome that she didn't make a big scene of it!", "Going to the amusement park.  Have never rode a rollercoaster before :/", "Yeah I'll just have to try it out I guess", "Aww :(  What did you end up doing instead?", "You could've always come on here and chat with other cool people like you :D", "Oh no, are they going to be okay?", "Oh, that will be so fun!", "Oh my, I hope she is ok?", "I would be too!  Was she at fault?", "Wow. It is very unsual to see that.", "Why? Do you want to do like him?", "That is so sweet of your child.", "He must be very smart!", "That's annoying! Did you end up eating it anyway?", "Sorry that you had a bad experience!", "Wow, what's the special occasion?", "Yeah, that is going to be a lot of work, and hard to transport to your job.", "Aww was it your birthday or something?", "OOO Kid Rock that's one of my friends favorites!", "I bet, its always nice to get a chance to work with someone you really like.  Where do you work?", "That does suck.  I work at Taco Bell making burritos.", "You must be very proud of your new set of teeth", "Congrats you can smile freely now :)", "What preferences do you mean? You shouldn't have to say your truth to anyone.", "There's nothing wrong with that and it's a shame people even question you about that.", "Congratulations! When is the wedding?", "I'm happy for you, I hope everything continues to work out!", "Oh no! That is so sad for you.  How embarrassing. ", "how sad.  I am so sorry you had to deal with that.", "Oh no! Did you manage to avoid a stain?", "Don't feel ashamed. You'll be able to laugh about it soon enough!", "Well I got the same result in both years because I'm lazy... so I didn't get into the university I wanted and I let my parents down which was shameful :(", "Well, I got into my other university which is great, however it's not the university I wanted. How about you, what's your story?", "Oh god that sounds terrible! Are you okay, is everyone in your house okay? Did anyone get hurt?", "I'm glad to hear that no one in your house got hurt. Gang crime needs to be stopped!", "Nah, I'm doing that whole no contact thing that people suggest.", "Thank you, I know I'll be fine eventually. It's just a rough go right now!", "That is horrible! Do you think it is really true, or she was trying to just make you angry? ", "You can always try to get a DNA test.", "Are you worried and nervous?", "I hope they do and everything is ok", "That is terrible.", "Who fault it was?", "Sorry to hear that. Is the feeling mutual?", "That is awful! Hopefully things work out for the better for you!", "Oh my lord, I would have been terrified. Are you okay?", "I am glad to hear you are okay.", "I feel you! Summer is great and all but I miss my classmates and the work I'm studying.", "I hope you have a successful semester!", "How did you do ?", "Congratulations, I hope you get a raise.", "Oh. I hope you get it! ", "That's a pretty substantial raise! ", "Oh no! What happened?", "Wow!  I would have been spooked about that too.  What did you do?", "I suppose it's all relative.  I realized it has been almost 25 years since I graduated from high school.", "How long ago did you graduate from high school?", "Yeah!  I went to her house yesterday (she lives about 30 mins from me) and I cooked her a catfish dinner!", "It was delicious!  Wish you could've been there!", "Yeah, I remember mine as well. They were always a great time.", "That sounds like so much fun, too bad those times had to ever end.", "WOW!  Congrats!  Was it hard contest?", "You must be very smart!", "Nice! what kind of car is it", "You're pretty lucky to have a boss like that haha", "Oh goodness, that is terrible.", "Yeah, delivery services have really fallen off.", "OMG!  How nasty!", "Did he at least offer to share with you?", "I'm sorry that happened. Maybe she was tired from working all day.", "Oh, I understand. Have you talked to her about how you feel about it?", "I have never had greek cuisine", "There aren't many restaurants where I live. Only fast food.", "I was nervous ands she was perfectly fine", "I know. I hope this lasts forever!", "What are union memners points?", "Oh. Maybe they should lower the fees or up the rewards", "I don't know yet. Its my daughter turn. The kids always pick gun movies", "I meant fun movies not gun movies lol", "Nervous? That's interesting. Has anything changed recently? What are your thoughts on why it's happening?", "I see. I'm sorry you're having trouble with that. Have you thought about therapy? Maybe your health insurance will cover a free consultation or something. Or perhaps you just need a simple routine change, with some exercise and more time outside. I hope you find the answer, whatever it is.", "That was rough, how long ago was this ?", "I'm sorry you had to endure this.", "That's pretty nice. I'm in college, and I've had three different roommates so far, having to move three different times. Starting to get old. You truly lucked out!", "I hope you guys are able to keep in touch. With that kind of experience, it sounds like it could be a good friend for life. As we get older, we let those kinds of people slip through our fingers. Try to maintain it as best you can.", "That is too bad. What are you going to do? Was this your first time gambling?", "That is too bad that you had to learn a lesson that way. I am sorry.", "It's nice that you tried to comfort him.  I'm worried about my parents, also.  It's hard to be worried about something like that in your family, knowing that you have no control over whether or not it will happen.  It's sad.", "Agreed - it's very stressful.  I live half a country away from my parents, and I'm worried I won't be able to help when either of them need it.  ", "I feel for you. My girlfriend is in the same position. Luckily we don't have kids to complicate things, but her job wears her out and it doesn't seem like she can physically or mentally keep up with it. Kids just make it so that you feel you have to do it until you die, no matter what.", "At least it sounds like you're giving it a lot of thought. You sound resilient. Most people would just quit or get fired, or not even realize the negative impact it's putting on their children. You seem very self-aware, so I'm sure you will be able to figure out the best decision for everyone involved. Good luck!", "What did he do?", "That stinks. I'm sorry about that", "Omg I was about to say that is so mean and rude and I would be so embarrassed but I know it was a honest mistake I dislike the auto correct. ", "lol I hope your friend understood and they can still meet up or communicate and if things work out it's a funny to tell in the future. ", "I'm going to an MMA show in Louisville.  There's going to be a bunch of awesome fights!", "I'm sure I will.  I can't wait!", "I think it's about time you lay down some rules!", "Is this a roommate situation or are we talking about kids? ", "Oh my yeah I would have been pretty irritated! ", "Yes it stinks when things just dont work out, but keep your head up, Im sure you will find someone you like that will be a big help to you!", "Nice!  Six months is a long time to be car-less.  I'm sure you have a new sense of freedom to do what you want and need to do while he's at work now.", "That's funny - true.  Hopefully the good part outweighs that, though.  ", "Well that still makes you a great friend! ", "Sounds like you all should stay away from bars lol. But if it keeps you acting good at home, then so be it. Your friend sounds like he needs a crack too", "Chlorella, Bitter Apricot and Wheatgrass. All should help me detox, get my gut in line and give me some much needed vitamins I can absorb.", "I wasn't but I have been trying to stay on organic for years..when you get older and get health problems and doctors only want to ignore you or prescribe pills and make it worse- It's good to research and help yourself.", "Have you had trouble lately?", "I hope things go well for you too.", "Oh really? I hate winter though! I don't want that to arrive :)", "I prefer it over the winter if I have to make a choice", "It's nice that you have a meaningful item from her.  It's a pretty bittersweet feeling thinking about someone you loved who is gone.  ", "That's nice - it's nice that you have memories like that.  I only have a couple of items from my grandparents, and I treasure them. ", "That would take such toll one me. Just make sure they have enough to keep them occupied maybe.", "Might have to bring them to the park and tire them out. School should starting up soon.", "That's awesome! It's always pleasant to have a good day.", "Little surprises like that really bring a new meaning to life!", "Oh, I hate it when that happens :( Have you looked on places like mercari or ebay?", "Yes! I get makeup I need more than half off on those places", "I find this context hard to believe.", "Oh geez! Really, that is interesting, but why would they want too!", "No- I would never want to be- They are too corrupt here. My neighbor has not come out of his house or let his dogs out in days. I am sure they won't do anything! They don't even show for gun shots..rape..beatings etc.", "I am a woman lol- I live in Michigan..in one of the most dangerous cities in the USA- Saving to move...Yes I think cops are getting worse everywhere- They seem to think they can do anything..and btw they can usually and not even get fired even when they shoot people in the back", "Well that is kind of you. They must really be going through something.", "That would be a lot to deal with. I hope things stay good for awhile.", "Oh god! I would be SO TICKED! Do they have cameras?", "That is AWFUL! My mom had that happen too- An old guy hit her atthe gas station and sped off! Seriously not fair!!", "Oh man that sounds horrible. I would probably faint.", "It must have hurt so much. ", "Thats amazing,  I am sorry for your loss, But atleast you have a constant reminder of him.", "Thats so sweet.  He is probably looking down happy you are wearing it!", "I did. But i had to rush and really hammer at it. ", "Glad you were able to finish. I know that's a lot of pressure.", "Oh no that's terrible! Are you going to apply again?", "I understand. Maybe apply at a different bank this time.", "Woow. That is terrifying. Are you alright? Do you live in some rural areas?", "Thankfully. Hearing your story, i am terrified now to even walk in my back yard anymore", "Yes, that always saddens me too. I see them now and then.", "Yeah, there should be, but often there is not really a good option for them.", "Good for you.  Being honest is important.", "Sometimes that's the best way to learn", "The note is for what?", "well, expect my note too,though it would be a soft copy", "What country? If you don't mind sharing...I'm in South Texas and loving it :)", "I'm sure you'll meet some cool people if you find a good Pho restaurant!", "Wow she must really fancy you. You should ask her how she found you.", "What a random surprise. Just make sure its not some creepy stalker. ", "Oh that is so gross! I hate bugs too!", "I hope none of them found a way home with you.", "Wow, so close to graduation!  What does he want to do after he graduates?", "Oh no!  I hope you're able to.  I know its hard for kids to look at the longer, bigger picture of life sometimes and just what he's going through now.  I took my GED early at 16 and graduated so maybe he wants to do that and start something else sooner.", "budget for what?", "You mean you have a budget for life?", "What?", "Maybe she has too much on her plate?", "Mistakes happen! I am sure people aren't too upset. I have numb hands so I drop things all the time", "That is true! But it's part of life, stuff happens. Not the worst!", "Feeling a bit scared about the weekend.", "I have a hard time with my anxiety sometimes and I will be alone a lot this weekend. I don't like free time, I like to stay busy so I don't think much.", "I don't trust a lot of people. I do like being alone sometimes but if not then I just want to be with someone I trust- They are not always available.", "I am not keeping something broken. I really needed a vacuum days ago though! So that was really irritating! Dealing with the CS took awhile and was a pain", "Well I am waiting until tomorrow now for a vacuum because I don't want to talk to anymore CS- but it's ALSO annoying that I have to wait for my refund :/ Yes! I needed a vacuum days ago and this wasn't a new one..so it was supposed to be inspected. I avoid CS like the plague and YEP they do outsource to other countries where the people can be very rude", "That is just sad of a Dad to be that way. Kids need a lot of unconditional love..but parents aren't always perfect and sometimes don't know how to love their kids like they should !", "Still doesn't make it okay. I hope he gets some therapy and learns to be a better dad", "Oh gross!  They should have street cleaners taking care of that.  Poor animal.  ", "I bet.  I have never seen one up close so that turns my stomach too.  I can't stand seeing injured, hurt, or dead animals. Hope you're feeling better now.", "I bet you are proud!", "Good I wish him all the best!", "I agree. I used to be a deadbeat but now my life is dope.  Are you talking about a friend or family member", "Yes you can lead a horse to water...but you know the rest", "Definitely not a sucker! If she helped you a lot and you wouldn't be here without her, then YES! Why did she block you? Were you bad to her? Sounds familiar to what has happened between me and a few...I was there for them but had enough and I have had to cuit them out too-", "That is hard..I have been abused and burned...and sometimes you just can't go back..It's like the story of a the girl with the feather pillow..once you say something..you can't ever get it back and it's so hard to repair. Its hard to ever trust someone once they have broken it..I am there myself and don't know if I could ever trust or live with that person again. Life is hard but I am VERY glad you have learned and will treat others better", "That's always a weird situation. You're excited about the offer, and you're worried that if you turn it down that you might not be able to find anything else, or as good. But you also don't want to be tied down to a bad place. What were some of the red flags, if you don't mind me asking?", "That's a really tough position to put yourself in. You would know better than most. I'm a cautious person.. if I felt like there was even a 50% chance of being able to find something close to decent, I'd turn them down. But if you think it's a desert out there and you can't find something to come close, it may be worth gritting your teeth and being there for a few years before you try to move on. I hope it works out!", "That is tough. I would just make sure everything is nice and clean around the house so she can just unwind. Maybe make a nice dinner and do the dishes after.", "I see.

I am so sorry- Turtles need a lot of care to thrive", "Actually they are, that is why so many die in captivity..They need proper lights and diet etc..I guess if you know how to take care of animals then no- but so many just don't care when they have a pet who relies on them", "What happened to the first one?", "I'm sure it will be fine.

I have been there and its devastating.  How is everyone doing?", "It will take time.  Allow yourself to grieve and also doing something to remember your pet can help give closure.

I'm glad she won't be gone too long.  I took advantage of the times he was gone to clean and organize and fix things to surprise him when he returned.", "Wow, you're on top of things! Being apart does make the heart grow fonder. :) Make (or carry out) her a romantic dinner when she gets back.

I don't go outside for long periods of time.", "That's too bad. don't give up though", "There will be something you like", "You must be so proud of her.", "That is great to hear. Sounds like she has good head on her shoulder.", "Congrats! What will your new position be?", "That's amazing! :)", "I'm jealous of you. I've had a roommate the past few years since I'm in college. First one I had battle depression and mental illness, and even checked himself into a behavioral center because he was feeling suicidal. This recent roommate seems normal enough though.", "I'm glad to hear it. At least you know you're good at being social in some ways.

Yea, he'll be very happy.", "Oh my gosh that's disgusting!!! I hate when there are flying things buzzing around Soo annoying", "Seriously. I wonder where those babies would have been laid?

People should really not be judging others when they don't know how much effort was put in to the outfit.", "Hi are you still here?", "It did, what were we talking about again?", "I can understand that. I lost my dog a few years ago. What's worse is I wasn't around when it happened--I was out of the state. I hope you at least got to say goodbye.", "Man.. I'm so sorry. I remember when I was really young, I was in the car with my mom and she hit our neighbor's cat driving home. They just ran right out into the street. She drove home and cried for a while.", "Who knows. They could have been like my mom, and maybe they were different and were too ashamed to say anything. Might not have noticed, either. Or they were just bad people. Hopefully you can focus on your pet and how much you loved them instead of those things you can't get answers to.", "... then what?", "Aw, wonderful!", "Well that's good!  What did you all do?", "We do something similar at our Thanksgivings.  Did you make a home-cooked meal?", "What sorts of pie did yo umake?", "We haven't really done pies in a while, but my grandma makes a chocolate roll and my mom makes some awesome pumpkin bars.  Do you roast your turkey?  We use a turkey fryer for ours.", "That sounds pretty awesome.  What did you guys grill?  Was she over for a special occasion at all?", "I agree.  I had a cousin living with me for a while until he got on his feet.  I really preferred that over a stranger.  It sounds like you both had an awesome night!", "cool", "i bet.

Were you nervous at first?", "Well that's nice that you all get along. you ar actually pretty lucky", "In the past couple of months I have barely cooked. We have eaten a lot a fast food. ", "I need to do that", "OH no! Did you study?", "LOL! English is a tough subject.", "That is a very big problem to me! However, if you signed a new lease with him it seems as if you can deal with it right?", "Well it seems that you have to deal with him for at least another year. With that in mind I hope you have more than one bathroom. I suggest you let him keep his poop in one without cleaning it up until it starts to bother him!", "Dang, that sounds too good to be true. If you're 100% sure that it's not a scam, and then 100% sure again that it's definitely not a scam (please really really check in every way possible), then I'm happy for you!", "Whaaat! That was cool of them. If it were me, it'd be torture trying to figure out what to do. Put it into stocks? Savings? Pay off debt? Go on a vacation? I hate making decisions cause I feel like I messed up no matter what I choose. But maybe you deserve a vacation, eh", "Congrats. you are lucky", "really? wow", "i know i won't. She has been saying all week she is picking a horror film", "I am going to take a pill and go to sleep lol", "She tried to kiss me when I already have a girlfriend.", "I was I felt so faithful in the moment my girl was proud oto.", "What did you get in the mail?", "That is awful, did you miss some payments?", "Whats the reason?", "I'm sorry to hear that, how is he feeling now?", "Not this weekend, but we have plans for the weekend after that!", "Nope, it should be an interesting and fun experience!", "I know that feeling!

Love them to death.", "Yeah! and they are so excited to see you and welcome you home!", "Why has it taken so long?", "Sorry.. when I first read what you said I read it as Grandparents.. I don't know why.  My brain is tired from work.", "Oh no, how did you end up in that situation.", "Haha, that's awesome, at least you two made it out of it safely.", "I would have been so excited lol.  What did it look like?!", "Was anyone with you?  Did anyone believe you?", "Thats awesome though.  I didn't graduate until I was 40 something", "That really is quite an accomplishment.. the type that makes you cry at graduation ceremonies!", "That's very sweet. I was just dog-sitting my neighbor's dogs last week. They were a little annoying at first, but I had to watch and stay with them the whole week, and I really grew to like them. They felt like my little sisters I had to take care of and play with", "Right, yeah, you just get used to their presence. I hated that they'd bark so much at thunderstorms, but other than that, their little quirks were growing on me. In fact, I miss them right now", "Have you been drinking more water lately? or it's just happening for no reason?", "That would be a good idea, it's better to get tested and treated early if it is anything serious!", "Oh my!  You must have been pretty embarrassed.  Did someone bring you gas?", "I'm sure its happened to him before and understands.", "Awesome! How was that? do you think she will enjoy high school?", "I know that feeling, I'm waiting for the college to start myself!", "Aww, that's so sad. I'm sure she would have wanted ya'll to keep having fun times together.", "Yes, it's good to keep bonding. I understand not being able to do it at first, though", "The most question are asked when I'm talking to someone else. does that happen to you too/", "That's all true", "Is there not an upgraded version?", "Oh. I know what you mean. I am like that with shoes. I always change my phone", "I would have though that your crystal ball would have forewarned you? ;)", "Did you keep your receipt?  Maybe you can exchange it or get your money back?  ;)  lol", "I feel your pain totally.  I take an online class and I am a teacher at a new school this year", "Fun times!  Makes you think back to being in HS.  I am working in a HS this time.", "Nice! I hate looking for apartments. I'm in college and have looked for apartments for the past three years. It gets really old after a while, since I'm on a budget and it's hard to find something cheap but not a rat's nest. Glad you found what you wanted.", "I live right next to my campus too! The downside is it's a building made in the '50s and looks terrible on the inside. But I can bear it since I'm saving money. Most college kids have their parents money and just choose a fancier place because they don't care about money. ", "I hate that!  Knowing a spider or any sort of bug is in your room and then knowing you have to go to sleep.  I would have done the same thing.", "Haha, while he builds back up his spider web.", "LMAO.  LOLOL.  I pay 600 a month.  You?", "see it can get worse!  lol... I am paying cash for my classes now but I only take 1 at a time.", "That's sad, well, HAPPY BIRTHDAY! ", "I sort of feel the same way, the older I get, the less I care about my birthday.", "Ah, so are you feeling pretty lonely? That's interesting that he took the dog with him on a business trip, but who am I to judge! Could be viewed as kind of cool that he's that close with the dog.", "Yeah, he should have left the dog with you so not only would you have some company, but some protection, too. But I don't know all of the situation so I guess I shouldn't say for sure! Hopefully it's not for too long so you guys can get back to being a trio", "Aw, you shouldn't feel bad!  At some point you'll have more cash and do the treating.  There's a lot of give and take in relationships.", "I totally get it.  I bet you think about it way more than she does, though I don't know if that makes you feel any better lol", "What restaurant is it?", "What kind of food do they make? Sorry to hear that! That's awful.", "Maybe they could get funding from the municipality.", "Marked what wrong?", "Did you speak with him?", "Oh. Well he will probably fix it when he gets better", "I can imagine", "Wow, congratulations! That is a really cool endeavor!", "Sometimes it is worth taking a risk like that to have a high reward.", "I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully after this project you can get some time off to spend with your family.", "I'm sure your family will understand. And look at the bright side, you'll cherish your next visit even more.", "That is always a good thing.  Is it free or a toll road?  Where I live most of em cost money.", "Thats awesome.  Saves time and money.", "I hope so.  I've had a week of training on how to control delinquent youth.", "Yes it is.. thanks I will need it.  At least they have a metal detector.", "She is most certainly going to enjoy that!", "No special occasion then?", "Yay! is it her first year or just excited to get some free time?", "Oh wow, she's must be smart! But yeah, that must be stressful.", "It's a pitch about an app our company is developing, like a chatbot", "Yes it is!", "Oh that sucks, I would honk harder at him", "Yeah, some cities have a lot of people and some really bad drivers. They're rude and disrepectful to all other people even pedestrians.", "Me too. I am very grateful. Some people are less fortunate", "I surely will. I do it now when I can", "My stepdad won't let me play baseball anymore simply because I hurt my arm throwing.", "I think so too maybe I could play some hockey instead.", "Why did you do that?", "So he was ok with it? or?", "We're going to be fishing near black duck bay.", "The weather is supposed to be ideal. We should do good.", "I'll try.", "Oh, bless her heart. I hope you are nice to her.", "That's really nice of you for being nice to her. I bet she is happy that you are her co-worker.", "Oh, well that's terrible! Hopefully, your husband was okay and nobody else was hurt. But, it's awful that anyone was.", "Yes, there are many times the emotional pain from tragic events are worse than physical. It doesn't make it easier that it was a person you knew, I'm sure. ", "It was calculus, just an intro class but I'm not so great at math.", "It was tough, just passed with a 51% thankfully.", "That's going to be a pain to fix yourself!", "That was really shady of them to do that, wonder why they did?", "I burned these old ones, had my favorite pop punk songs ont hem.", "Truly the best days to be fair.", "When doe sit come out in theatres?", "Oh I got you, what system is it going out on?", "Oh no, I hope you was paying attention to what was around you.", "That is really scary when you are alone.", "Oh my gosh, what a place to break down!  I was born in ND and I know the dark you are talking about.  Were you stuck for long?", "Oh yeah, of course.  I heard they are rampant up in those parts.  Did they keep you long?", "I hope they returned you with all your bits and parts.  It would be alarming to find they borrowers from you later!", "Oh man truer words were never spoken! How are you gonna spend your free time this weekend?", "That's my thought process like every week. I think I might be getting old because sometimes I like sleeping more than being awake.", "Oh no! All that work for nothing", "Did it at least taste good? lol", "I need to get one for myself.", "Yeah, I've seen those. Do they work good?", "I'll have to go do some shopping.", "Awesome.  Is she going to university after?", "That's great to hear.  She'll be flying out of the nest before you know it.", "No it's pretty rare. She's in Digital journalism, and she's working as a social media manager. It's a good gig. ", "Yeah, I'm happy for her. What do you do?", "What type of food do you miss most?", "It sounds like you might be from down south. I would miss it there, too.", "What?! Are you sick or your family member?", "Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that, it must have been hard on you", "How exciting!  Who did you order from that gave you such good service?", "I would order again also, that's a good company.", "I love going there!  We didn't find out till December that we could go.  Suddenly I had a lot of planning to do!", "We did!  Once I realized we could go, I couldn't wait for the time to pass.", "Its a little scary.  I don't want to deal with a mountian lion.", "How exciting!  Is that your going to be your first time visiting?", "I hope you have a good time there.  Be careful in the interior, it's hot as heck there.", "Just a little, since she was around other cats for the first time. I think I was more of a wreck than she was though.  The house seemed so empty without her.", "I slept through it all when I could, or went to visit my little brat.", "Thanks, and to you too. They really are our best friends. ", "Agreed. I will probably consider a rescue dog, my second dog is lonely now. ", "Why do you feel that way?  Has he enacted any policies that directly affect you or anyone you know?  For the record - I'm not too fond of him either, just curious more than anything.", "I agree that he has said some things to suggest that.  However, I do think he has done some good and wouldnt necessarily be the worst president we have ever had.", "That is very thoughtful.  Happy Birthday! What did you get from your partner?", "Wow!  Now that's one cool gift if I may say so myself.", "What did it say?", "Wow, was it?", "That's awesome. Have you been going to school for a while or is this for first semester.", "Awesome. Its great. Helps keep down the student loans.", "Yes, Mechanical engineering.", "Math and science is my strong suite.", "What did you have in there?", "I love veggies, do you know who did it?", "That's mean of them, they better give it back to you.", "I'd still scorn them for their actions.", "What's your favorite holiday?", "I love that pie!!! It's delicious! My favorite holiday is Christmas. ", "That's good! I think a lot of older people are pessimistic about the future, but I grew up on technology and am excited to see what new stuff comes out.", "I think we need more people like you in society.", "That's smart. You don't want to forget anything. Are you planning a trip soon?", "What a relief, right? Where are you going?", "I did too. Graduated High School in 85", "Well, that's different then.", "Pit stops can be fun.  How did you do on the scratch off?", "No way! Congrats!!! I've never come close to that much on a scratch off.  I bet your heart was racing.", "It was, I was like a boss in there.", "I am a bit of a menace on the dance floor.", "What type of work do you do?", "You must be getting a big pay raise you ole banker.", "I hate when that happens.  Did they end up apologizing at all or did they play it off like nothing happened?", "I would be too.  Its not fun when a couple people ruin a night that should be a great time!", "That's no good, how did you break it?", "no good, are you going to get another one?", "I'd buy it off you after it's fixed, I love tag heuer.", "I wouldn't maybe I could get some recommendations for a nice one?", "Which chemistry class are you taking?", "Yikes. organic chemistry was the last chemistry class I took.     Yuck reaction mechanisms... sn1 sn2 etc.", "yeah I wasn't a huge fan of the class.", "Depends on what way you're talking about Maybe physics 1 or maybe calc II.  Thats where things really started to come together for how things work +  the math to understand how things work.", "What are your favorite parts about your childhood?", "That sounds like a lot of fun.  Did you do this with friends and family or alone?", "Yeah but not for any good reason. I do a good job.", "Me too!", "Yes, about 5 years.  I've also taught this class before.", "Kinda.  I'm excited to see who takes the class and help them learn to decorate cakes, but teaching the class is the easy part.", "Oh wow I have never been either.  Try not to be nervous!

I hope that they will win again,", "What did you argue about?", "That is smart, sorry that is happening to you!", "What movies do you like to watch instead? ", "Any favorite actors? ", "no.

What book?", "Oh I've read that, That is a really good book, I even enjoyed the movie as well.", "Maybe you should talk with him about how you feel?", "Well at least you can say you tried. Sometimes teenagers need to figure it out on their own.", "That is so, so sad. Are they going to separate or is there a chance that he can change his ways and earn her trust again?", "It is very difficult, but I've see marriages recover from that position - but it takes years to build up that trust again properly. I wish them all the best", "Oh gross, you should bail quick if you see a kid getting sick, so that you won't be around to help clean it up.", "I'm sorry, maybe a nose plug would come in handy", "as a matter of fact my friend asked me help him move recently , but i was busy at work too he understood ", "we cant win them all , but work always comes first ", "How'd it taste?

", "1982", "That is great that they are willing and able to help.", "I bet that was such a relief for you guys!", "Oh wow I bet you were really proud?", "I'm sure he will! Best of luck to him!", "That's the worst, when they take forever.. Have you called them up?", "Yeah, I understand, they should at least give you a discount!", "I feel jealous I didn't get the artistic genes my brother got lol", "Probably! Makes me feel better now lol", "That's really awesome! You are a really lucky person!", "That's so awesome. I wish my godmother did that!", "That is awesome.

Very annoying.", "Yea, I need to make more time for them", "I will, thanks.", "How many slices did you ate?", "That's a lot for anyone, lol", "I've done this before! It can be very nostalgic to see old friends that you haven't seen in awhile. Did it bring back any particular memories?", "You could always make a collage with your favorite pictures! ", "I sort of have. I worked like crazy to get a work visa for the US, so I could be with the person I wanted to spend my life with. It paid off, so I can kind of understand what you're saying.", "Scotland. It's quite a process getting in here, despite what some people try to tell you! What happened with you?", "Is that a good thing or a bad thing?", "Well stay focused and work hard! You got this!", "Maybe you could get out and meet some new people.", "Sounds like a plan.", "Yeah arcades are pretty sweet. I like that some of them have bars in them now. ", "I'm not surprised. It also helps me play better!", "Congratulations and I'm sure you will do fine.  Do you think you will enjoy doing it?", "It'll be a good experience at the very least, good luck!", "Who are you talking about?", "that is sad. why would he gossip! that's so low", "That could be so hard on you", "Just keep your mind occupied with other important stuff", "Congrats! Is this your first child?", "I think you will do fine! You will be in love at first sight for your!", "Congratulations, she must be a quick one, I was always the slow one at the back of the pack.", "Wow, that's impressive, she might get a scholarship one day!", "I imagine, that must be so awful.

You did your best, and I'm sure he is in heaven now looking over you!", "I can definitely understand how you would be worried about that.  I think I'd have to decline - LOL!  You are a good person for being willing to meet with him.", "Well, yes if there is a child involved, then you've got to deal with him at some point.  I hope it goes well for you though.", "I've never watched a single full star wars movie, just bits and pieces haha", "Thanks, I will look into it!

No I've never had to deal with that before. I hope your husband is ok!", "That's awesome that you had such a great support network to help you. ", "Umm..did you MEAN to kick it?", "They are kinda like rats with wings.", "Aw, poor fellow, well I'm sure he was close to his home.", "There's always next time, forgive yourself and help the next pupper you see!", "Oh you must be so sad, I know I would be if that had happened to me.", "That is great! I have a dog that I adopted in similar circumstances. ", "Oh god no, my heart would be racing. Were you scared?", "Damn, i can't imagine ever going through that.

", "So what would you do to halt that?", "Thats thoughtful!\\", "That's not good, do you think he will pay you?", "You can take out a loan, but good luck, I hope you get it!", "And no one told you about it?  Maybe no one noticed it at all?", "That is horrible!  I hope they realize that their reaction was not exactly nice.", "Oh my! I hope is ok!", "Yeah that is a really suckying thing to do to you. ", "So how does he afford such luxury?", "Ok ,he shouldn't have stopped! Other kids deserves it too", "How so?", "Hard work usually pays off. Which exams are you taking?", "I hope she recovers soon. I know it is hard to see loved ones sick.", "That is good to hear. I am sure she will be fine.", "Good for you! You are a lucky person!", "That's great! I'm a bit jealous.", "Yeah i've been through that feeling before, I had a show that was going to get cancelled but thankfully it got saved by another company. What show was yours?", "Oh i've heard of that show, never got around to seeing it though. That sucks!", "That's really great. I'm happy for you.", "Congratulations, it sounds like you've really made it. I envy you.", "It was a project for work. I was going to get a bonus if I met yesterday's deadline. I could really kick myself about not being able to finish on time.", "Yeah, maybe so, but I really could have used that bonus.", "Yes! I always cried when I watched it as a child.", "Yes! My kids cried too ", "Oh I love the thrill of a good roller coaster.", "It's definitely not for everyone. You either love them or you don't.", "I could imagine. Dogs are amazing.", "Definitely. Hold on to those.", "Thats great, family comes first over everything!", "Yep, they're always there for you no matter what", "Yeah don't. They really aren't that great.

It happens", "Yeah, or buy pants without zippers. But don't stress it, i'm sure whoever saw it didn't really mind!", "Oh that sounds exciting. I've always wanted to go.", "I've flown but not much and never left the country either. I hope y'all have fun :)", "There's some decent benefits to doing things the old way.

Its terrible!", "That sounds like such a surprise. Does he have a disability that keeps him at home?", "That's great to hear! My papa is getting older too. It's nice to be able to spend time with him.", "Oh awesome, what part of Florida?", "Oh that sounds really fun and I bet she will love it all. I'm jealous :)", "wow ,try next time!", "well, thats how fate would have it", "I'm sorry to hear that.  What happened?", "I know how frustrating it can be when we receive so an awful service.  They should train people to do a better job.", "That is so sad. I know how it feels to lose a pet.", "I lost a goldfish once. She was my best friend.", "Bet you'll be glad to have some free time on your hands at last.", "lol - yeah I can relate. Kids can be a real handful when they don't have structure - as in during the summer months.", "Why do you say that?", "Okay now I understand... COMPLETELY! I deal with that daily! I am ready to give up on ever cleaning again.", "That sounds rather convenient. Are you giving up anything for that?", "If it's too traumatic for him, you can always try to put him back.", "Oh my goodness! What did you do? I bet your heart was racing!", "hahaha that sounds about how I would have reacted! I once saw my shadow on the blinds in my living room. I sat there frozen thinking someone was outside. Then, I moved and the shadow did too!", "Thats awesome, i dont have kids yet but i was also looking through some old school photos of me and my friends. Such innocent times.", "Yes it does, I wish her the best! early adulthood is the best time!", "True, but I'm talking about the ability to binge-watch an entire series in the course of a week. Do you know I've only started watching Game of Thrones two years ago?", "If you've never seen it, do yourself a favor and watch the first two episodes.", "I would be so mad. I can't believe people can do that and sleep at night", "I hope so too. That is just not right. They could have left a note at least.", "wow! love birds,how nice,so where exactly are you headed?", "Well,it would be a whole new experience for you", "How annoying! Did she fix it fast?", "That would be frustrating. Did it get corrected? Did you still have to pay?", "im sorry thats awful, i hope he makes a full recovery", "i can only imagine!", "That's cool, what is the position?", "Don't wish, demonstrate. Do something that reflects what type of supervisor you're going to be. People love previews.", "Hmm. Superman, Spiderman. Voltron. Batman!", "It's like they are trying to destroy the concept of canon. ", "Oh, that's too bad. Perhaps have the picnic indoors? It wouldn't be the same, but at least you could share food and have a laugh!", "I can imagine. That's the problem with planning outside events - we can't dictate the weather. You should try planning something outdoors in Scotland, where I'm from - soggy food every time!!", "My husband was diagnosed with this type of cancer. I really needed to talk to you about it.", "I just want to vent, I'm not sure how to feel right now. I'm mad at the world.", "LoL....no sweetie, I'm sure it's your dog again. Didn't the same thing happen last month?", "Oh sorry about that I thought you had a dog. Well then maybe the noise the some type of critter. Have you checked under the bed today?", "I remember that. A lot of people were grossed out and didn't want to do it. Were your girls one of them?", "Yea, it tends to be kinda gross. My teacher had us dissect fish as well and I prefere that much more for some reason", "I sure hope they are trustworthy.", "It is so good to have someone that is trustworthy no matter what you tell them.  I'm glad you have a friend like that.", "I'm so sorry to hear that, my girlfriend's cat is going through the same thing right now. It can't be easy.", "That's so sad... The best thing you can do is spend lots of time with her and make every minute count. I wish you all the best.", "Usually people want someone in their life. I guess that takes staying away from others.", "Some people prefer to be alone. Whatever makes them happy I suppose.", "I would laugh so hard if that was me seeing my dog do that", "I hope you can share it on social media so that the whole world can share in the fun :)", "i do too, its a shame", "i am too, i hope we can make a change before it is too late", "Lucky for you! I'm at work right now! Haha!", "No, its fine! Enjoy your day off, I definitely would if I were you!", "Oh, that's awful. Were you okay, or did you have to go to the hospital?", "That sounds terrifying! I've never been in a car accident, and sure wouldn't like to be in one.", "oh wow did it bring back memories?", "That is so fun!  Memories are always a wonderful thing to have", "Well it is good to be thankful. We have to remember all the little things.", "It is good to appreciate what we have, not opine for what we don't have.", "I hope you got it on camera, I would if i was in your shoeas", "Nice, buddy he will thank you for it when he grows up", "He's been getting speech therapy since he was 1.", "Thank you, so do I!

I'm so bad with directions.", "What did you end up doing?", "I depend so heavily on my GPS, i don't know what i would have done", "Oh that's great news. I bet he is having lots of fun.", "That's great. Some people can go through college and still don't know what they want to do.", "That's a ton of oysters! I don't think I've even ever eaten one oyster. What's a mixed plate? ", "Hmm it's funny how seasonings and spices really alter the viability of a food. Was the buffet all seafood?", "Hmm ya I make more than my parents which is all I ever really asked out of life though sadly less than I would make in a bigger town.", "I agree one hundred percent! At the end of the day, being around my friends and family means a whole lot more than an extra 10k. ", "Oh man that had to be embarrassing.  I know how you feel though b/c I once went to work with two different shoes on", "Well it will probably never happen again so don't worry about it to much", "I'm so sorry. I know that must be very difficult for you. It's nice that you have pictures to look at and remember old times together.", "Pictures are a great way to remember the past. I treasure every picture. Each holds a special memory.", "They were being loud and obnoxious and not listening.", "They are 3 and 5 so hopefully when they get older!", "Dogs can be so destructive.", "Poor thing had no clue why you were mad", "Ok ,so are you gonna go?", "thats nice", "Dang three times?  I hope you get that figured out!", "Yeah get that right.  Make sure you don't fail it four times!", "How shocking! I have got to know, are you keeping the puppies or giving them up for adoption?", "Good idea. I hope they aren't too much of a handful until then!", "Oh that sounds horrible. I hope it wasn't a long ride on the bus. ", "Oh no, that is a long time to be sitting in trash basically.", "i bet so. its a shame when people dont take care of their teeth", "i wouldnt doubt it!", "I have found that using alot of online recipes with good instructions helps. Cannabis also induces hunger and reduced adhd thus it helps me pay better attention, even more so when I'm hungry af! ", "yes I always pay attention to the reviews and peoples personal comments, they can often be priceless!", "I can like for instance someone using an automated system when they claim to be selling items as \"hand made\"", "It can be especially when your income depends on it! ", "Did you at least study for it?", "That is the best feeling!", "Oh wow, that really sucks. Did you ever find the culprit?", "Yeah, I would've definitely quit once I saw that.", "I hate when they do that! Were you able to clean the rug?", "I bet! Time to get him trained a little better.", "Wow that is huge. He must have a lot of stuff to haul.", "As long as he remembers to make wide turns. Otherwise bad things happen haha.", "Has it ever been a ghost?", "Yeah fears like that are pretty unconsolable.", "That's so awesome! What did he say?", "Oh my. What a strange first word.", "I'm not quite sure I understand, did you go bowling by yourself? If so that's so sad and lonesome.", "As someone who deals with lonesome moments, I know how that feels. I would've totally gone with you had I known you haha.", "did you feel like being spontaneous or just did it for the thrill of it", "next time you go in, put the money of the candy into one of those charity cans", "Yeah me too! Are you going to go with anyone?", "Nice! I am sure it is going to be a ball of a time.", "That is a real bummer. Maybe you should take some time to reflect on their life.", "Yeah, no need to talk to me about it right now. Think about all the good times you had together.", "That really stinks. Have you gone to get some help on it?", "I am sure he will be able to help you. I hope you pass.", "Oh no. That sounds like a messy situation.", "Hopefully he'll learn that that's not the place to do that.", "I am sure once you clean up your scruffy look you'll be able to land all the ladies.", "Nah, you can forgo deodorant. The media just tells everyone it's necessary since it's a poorly known method of government mind control.", "He must be related to my dog. Was it hard to clean up?", "You may want to check his diet. Something in not right there.", "Yes, it is great! Even better she just received her Master's Degree at the tender age of 50!", "You know she inspires me. She always reminds me of what hard work can do for you.", "Really, I can't believe you like it. Are you sure he bought it and not his mom lol?", "Either way you have the perfect outfit to go on a date with your boyfriend right?", "Oh no! Is your dog trained to go outside?", "I'm sorry to hear that. Just take some deep breaths, wear gloves and maybe even a mask if it makes you feel better. You can do this and you'll be alright!", "Yeah, I am the same way. Incredibly unsafe to do such a thing.", "I know. I don't want to die doing something incredibly mundane.", "i hope you feel bad about what you did ", "as long as you can live with yourself , is all that matters lol", "That sounds very relaxing. What kind of book was it?", "Oh I get that magazine too. I like it for the stories.", "Dang. What did you by? Mountain dew and doritos?", "A much better purchase than the neckbeard's staple. I hope you won!", "That sucks, was it a nice rug?", "That's awful, put the dogs nose in it.", "Nice! Which one you getting?", "Dang! Now that is a savvy phone! I have 12 of them.", "Aw how wonderful. She must have been really proud of herself and happy.", "Truth be told: I never learned how to ride a bike.", "It's a pretty fun project! I like teaching my kids about how to be self sufficient and they enjoy gardening.", "Absolutely! Not to mention gardening saves a ton of money in the long run.", "Have you been studying? If you do that, I am sure you won't fail.", "Nice! I am sure you will pass with flying colors.", "You are the 2nd one today. Was it a mile high?", "That must have been quite the workout. At least you should have plenty of fuel for the winter.", "oh thats a nice surprise", "thats really cool", "Shocking. Does that not happen often for you?", "Ah well better than me. I get it so much it doesn't even bother me anymore.", "Lol owning it is just about the only thing you can do at that point!", "I hope nobody in your office is the easily offended type!", "Nice! Did you steal anything while you were there?", "Well, at least you filled your stomach. Next time, don't forget about your pockets!", "Congratulations, thats amazing.  What did he say?", "Wow, hes a pretty smart kid.  He must be reading up on his history and the communist manifesto.", "That's too bad. Did someone cut you off?", "Awww I would be sad too. Did anyone go and get it?", "Understandably so. You must be pretty anxious over the whole ordeal.", "That's a great idea. No need to let go of the place you call home completely.

I would've been sick.", "lol sorry for laughing , but that sounds like something i would agree to and forget, im afraid of heights too ", "sometimes when my friends are annoying me , i tune out ... later o yeah we are supposed to do this today and blah , blah , blah", "Oh, that's a good point! I never realized how much money I was spending for fast food until I started making a budget.", "My go to lazy-sandwich are fried balogna sandwiches.

Ill make someone else do it", "I was starving and I needed to eat. But I feel kind of bad about it, since I am sated now.", "I know. I really shouldn't have stole it in the first place.", "That's horrible! What happened?", "That really sucks. I am glad you are okay.", "I've began looking already, but it's going to be a very difficult transition and I doubt I will start out at the same pay. I'm at a loss for what to do... This is horrible.", "I may have to suck it up and settle for a less expensive home and vehicle. At least I still have my health.", "Well that's great! I'm guessing he has a bad habit of doing that?", "I guess you've been training him and it's paying off? Tell him he's a good boy and give him a belly rub!", "Oh that's so aggravating, my dog still has accidents but not many", "That's terrible but the rug is replaceable.

I might have to give it a try and let me mother know about it, she has a lot of pain in her legs as well.", "I absolutely will! Thanks for the suggestion.", "That sounds like so much fun.  What concert is it?", "Don't stop believin.  I bet you'll have a great time!", "I wouldn't look forward to that either. What are you going in for?", "That doesn't sound grand at all.

Is that the first time it has happened?", "May I recommend gloves?  Thick gloves.  And a lot of carpet cleaner.", "Wow, that really stinks. Did you catch the culprit?", "Yeah, especially since I imagine that is a costly monthly expense. I would install some turrets in your garage.", "That's always fun to clean up.", "Think of it this way. Yesterday I had to clean up my dog's vomit, where it vomited up a used tampon.", "Nice! Which game is it?", "Sounds really fun! I think I will pick it up today.", "That's cool. What city?", "Oh sweet. I hope he has a good time in college.", "Oh I'm so sorry to hear that.

We're you able to clean it up?", "Yeah hopefully it doesn't happen again!", "Ew! Sounds like a disgusting job.", "That's great! Good to hear you're saving some money!", "I do too, but seems like most people are like that nowadays", "I would be mad, we had that problem all the time at the last place we lived. ", "Oops. Could you sneak it back in without him seeing you?", "Depends how close you are and how mad he'll be. Usually, I advocate honesty, but don't know enough about your situation to advise.", "Oh boy. I honestly don't know what to say. Maybe ask him outright if he's cheating. If he is, do you really want to stay with him? If not, it doesn't matter if he knows about the phone or not!", "Good luck! But be nice - I've confronted people before and totally lost it. I then regretted it.", "That sucks, hope it didn't dry into the carpet.", "That's pretty understandable.", "thats great, good job", "i know that feel", "Nice! Where is he going to school at?", "Wow, that's pretty far away. How do you feel about him going all the way up there?", "dangit , i would have been pretty upset , not to mention the clean up ", "shhhhhheeeeess , that would have given me a small heart of attack or just tunnel vision out of rage", "That's so sad! Maybe you should give him a call?", "That's the spirit! The loneliness should melt away!", "Oh no!! You must have been so mad!", "That dog probably wouldn't be living in my house anymore!! Did you have it cleaned?", "That is not good.  Did you scold your cat?", "I can imagine.  My dog used to stain the carpet too.", "That really sucks.

Do you do anything special to it?", "That is all good to know! I'll have to keep it in mind next time I cook it.", "That is terrible, I am so sorry. Was it of natural causes?", "You can just replace him that fast? Don't you need time?", "Thats pretty brave of you facing a fear like that.  How did you feel when the flight was over?", "Flights are convenient though.  Definetly faster than driving somewhere", "How exciting! Where to?", "I am happy for you and hope you have a lot of fun!", "Congratulation! thats awesome. I know how much work that can be", "You'll get there one day.  It takes time and saving ", "Lol are they still holdig that against you?", "Lol. We all cheated at some point.  They know that.", "Did you try to find someone to go with?", "Maybe you should find some new friends.", "Mine did too - 5 minutes ago, actually.

I don't want you to stress out to much, you are the excited bride!", "Well good, let her do all the worrying and you focus on your big day!", "Yes it is upsetting, because she alludes to her children being smarter and more well-rounded than mine.", "I have not had a conversation with her about it. However, I know she does it on purpose just to get on my nerves. She has a history of getting enjoyment out of messing with me and now my kids.", "where did it go?", "I hope so, hope is still alive, and Have you search everywhere?", "under my roof, she taught I will be off to work, I forgot something and I caught them in the act", "I hope so, just trying to be strong", "Oh that is awesome!

And, we don't have to wait two weeks for shipping like back in the day", "did you try redoing your steps of the last day? to see maybe you left it at a friends house", "i feel bad for you, have you tried asking other people that are near you often to see if they have seen it?", "What do you love about football season? (They're football right?)", "Wonderful! Good luck, I hope they win.", "Bad behaviors and attitudes. It's hard to see they keep going back to the same path.", "Well therapy will, I hope! Thank you", "It's awesome. Sometimes I also try to find solutions in youtube.", "Yeah, you're right.", "That's terrible. Did you guys clear that out?", "People must have no lives to want to spread rumors like that.", "Oh my. How did you handle the situation with your toddler?", "They can be pretty crazy at that age.", "I bet your so excited!

Were you in a bad part of town or anything?", "That kind of thing always creeps me out.  Glad you made it ok!", "Yes,  My partner was being a bit rude and he can explode easy, so it's hard.", "Yes, it is hard, thankfully he does have a reason..a mental illness and he is working on it- but it's still hard for me. I hope you have peace now!", "A small amount of money... which is better than nothing.", "Hey I'll take it.  Thanks :)", "Sorry *I cannot get it to work. No, I can't afford that really. I have to order a bunch of parts now and it's a bummer! I would have someone come mow it for a quick 20 but they don't show up.", "Lawn mowers seem to require a lot of maintenance, like a car. Worth it I guess as I don't have $300 for a new one. Ha! Expensive", "I hear you! What made you feel all alone?", "Oh okay! Where did they go?", "It was 20 years back", "No. I am retired", "Complaint them about the product", "OMG. That's unfair", "You must be proud. What kind of cake did you make.", "I love tres leche.

Jerks.", "Is your current ceiling fan broken?", "Nice, I hope you enjoy it.   Grats on the house too.", "OH! I do too! They are so healthy and you can get them without any sugar too!", "Oh...well you should try it without, fruit itself is already full of sugar :) If you try the ones with orange juice, they can be pretty sweet on their own.", "No, my partner isn't here anymore. I live alone,...except for furkids :) But everytime I felt that way..I remembered the bad times and I didn't feel so bad about living alone.", "True! Thank you! They do for sure. It's hard to be without a partner but truly it's better then being abused.", "Oh yes they are! I love it when that happens", "Lol! Cool, what kind of memory did it trigger?", "Oh you are brave! I LOVE the ocean but I am terrified of being in the middle of it :)", "15...As in any city. There are kids and animals here and the police never do anything about these wreckless drivers.", "Yes, because 1 person including kids get hit here daily and this is a SMALL city...They complain about having no money here..but they would get a TON of money if they would ticket these terrible drivers that can and DO kill others daily.", "did you mute it", "i hate when that happens", "We don't see many here.

Very abusive childhood and has given him a lot of mental health issue.", "I know right..They were horrible..beatings..calling him names..having him hold down their autistic brother to beat him..ENCOURAGING them to be mean and cruel to any form of \"weakness\" etc...He has so many problems from it and definitely RE-ENACTS it with me..I can't do that anymore..No abuse and dysfunction allowed here..So I am hoping this helps him more.", "That sucks.  Someone in a parking lot do  that to you?", "and I bet they just drove off and didn't even leave a note.", "Thanks, it was pretty nice to get some recognigtion.", "Yep, my bosses sure don't do it.", "That has to be really annoying.  Have you called animal control?", "Yes, that's one way to deal with it.  What did you end up doing?", "I'm sorry to hear that. Was there something going on around you that made you scared?", "Wooded ares are beautiful, until you have to be alone in them, when it's dark.", "that he had the stones to do it a second time", "sure", "that sounds cool", "i bet it was", "That sounds like so much fun. I've actually never been to a casino but would love to.", "I would feel the same way. I'm not always very lucky though so I'd be a little apprehensive at first.", "I'm sure she'll be happy with whatever gift you got her.", "What was it that she wanted?", "Wow.

The owner took me home and my Dad gave me a hiding. Never again!", "Oh yes. While other teenagers were thieving I was being a very good little girl!

Could you persuade them to go to a restaurant?", "Good for you! I'd be so busy yelling at my husband I'd forget to cook, lol. Do you know them well?", "Well, that's at least something! It's when he decides to invite the boss and his wife over when you'd decided dinner was mac n' cheese - that's when it gets hairy!", "That would be scary! Were you able to catch her?", "That's good, there is nothing scarier than a fur baby missing!", "Wow, thats so cool! I wish i could rock climb.", "I can understand that.

I hate, hate talking in front of a crowd.", "I'm sure you'll be fine, just try to practice as much as possible beforehand", "I'm sorry, but that made me laugh a little bit.

I guess I won't know if the research paid off until I try!", "Well thanks, that means a lot to me!", "That is a pretty big decision to make. Did she spring this up on you or was this something you knew she'd eventually want?", "I hope you can figure out a way to make things work out! Sounds like you're stuck between a rock and a hard place.", "That profession takes a lot of courage and a unique set of skills and personality. That's pretty cool that you took that route--sometimes I think about the \"what if\" of if I took that route. Pretty sure most people have that fantasy, but only the people brave enough actually go on the path to do it, like you", "Well, at the very least, from the little that you've said, you seem very self-aware. That's a very underrated trait for people to have and to develop.. so whatever it is you decide, it seems like you'll be efficient at seeing it through. Good luck!", "Ooh, that's awesome. It's great when you can spend a little extra on the fun things.", "Congratulations, I'm glad to hear you've been able to accomplish that for yourself. :)", "I always wished I could do that with my dad. But he had a stroke in his 40s, and was never in good enough health to do it with me. That and I was kind of shy and introverted, so I never made friends to do it with, either.

I have a cat who just had four kittens. They're adorable!", "Well that's very kind of you to help them out.", "I'm a little shaken up, but I think I'll be okay.

I secretly dialed 911.", "Ah, dang, did he know you were trying to buy it also?", "Well, maybe you can set a deal up with him and you can share it!", "well you can improvise and make everyday household items into a gym that work just a well!", "yes. youtube will def have some awesome ideas . i could stand to get rid of this gut also..hahahah", "Oh wow! That sounds scary! I'd be mad!", "How annoying! That sucks.", "Oi...I don't like doctors or the dentists.", "lol! I do not blame you, did you look up reviews?", "Yeah, the struggle is real! I might have to take out a loan!", "I do, but I would rather not bother them.", "Aw, I love puppers! What kind is it?", "Aw, I'm happy for you, they are really a joy and can make your life happier!", "It's a charter school. That means that it is public, but that they focus more on academic and a classic education. Less common core.", "Amen!", "Yes he works hard at his job and he lives in socks and shoes- so both are important.", "He does various things for a roofing company. Works long hours. ", "lol! My mom used to do that with books, she would read the ending first.", "Nope she still reads it all. Same thing you do silly! lol", "Lol- cats are picky- Here I have a bunch of animals so someone will always like it. She won't leave her cage though and stays curled around her puppy all day and the blankets I have weren't cutting it so she seems more comfortable now- She is in a cage because she feels safer- she was trying to bite other animals.", "My dogs are just not picky. And they never leave you alone lol! I do have one dog that chews any dog bed or blanket though :( Sigh- Lab mix! He is a handful and a half.", "Aww, I can see how that might make you feel really bad. Was it replaceable?", "That's a real bummer. On the bright side, it taught your son that sometimes accidents happen and that's OK.", "oh no! that is horrible and those things always seem to happen when on your way to work or somewhere important", "wow that is a really expensive tire!!", "Woohoo! That sounds like it'll be a blast to drive!", "Just make sure you drive safely! :)", "I bet that was exciting to watch", "I am sure he got some things from you", "Ah, I'm sorry, well you can redeem your family and be a good influence to your community!", "I bet you're a great person and don't worry about the past!", "A good feeling about the weather?", "Oh how neat!  I guess you must have sensed it!", "That's neat!  Where did you go?", "Oh that sounds exciting!  I've never had the chance to go to one.", "I hope so.", "I do it was a mistake, I'll do my best to never do it again.", "Wow, what did you do?", "It is what I thought. You did good.", "you should probably talk to that co worker and if it doesn't stop i would report it to the HR", "I don't think you would make any problems. who knows maybe he is a pervert", "Oh no!  What happened?", "I am sorry to hear that.  Hopefully at least he is making progress", "We help make sure they are well fed and have a warm place to sleep. We also get to spend  a lot of time socializing with them as well. Some of the sweetest people in the world. Makes it difficult to imagine what could have caused their situation.", "Oh wow, that boils my blood! I don't understand why it's so difficult to allow these types of things to continue.", "Exactly. While some people quite possibly have brought it on themselves, to assume that all or even most have, is nothing short of ignorant and hateful.", "Temporary teeth? How long do those last?", "Ah yeah, that was a pretty good idea then. Hopefully she can get some permanent ones soon!", "Yikes. That is incredibly expensive for one tooth.", "Awesome! Congratulations! I'm sure you earned it.", "It's good that they appreciate you and are kind enough to reward you for your efforts!", "You're gonna miss the launch. What are you doing on here?", "Have you been playing for a long time?", "I've been playing since 2006.", "I hate to hear that. Did the person that got the job deserve it?", "Well, I have faith that you will find something just as good, keep your head up and keep trying.", "Where are you going? Are you scared of going on the plane or going to a new place?", "I'm sure you'll have a blast, I've heard it's beautiful continent. And the food will be great!", "Maybe if you search some more it will go on sale. But if you really like it you should get it.", "Just think how happy it will make you feel each time you wear it.", "Ohhh I've been checking it out too!  What side are you going with?", "Lok'tar ogar! I love my undead necromancer! What race/class will you go with for Alliance?", "Oh man. That sucks. NY is really fun. Why couldn't you go?", "I would be kind of mad and dissappointed with him. You could have offered to pay your own way!", "That's pretty cool! Was it a professional game?", "Sounds like he's a good player! You should ask him for some tickets!", "Aw man. I am guessing you already went to the store. Did you have to interact with the manager?", "Yeah that stinks. Is it a store you go often?", "Oh absolutely! Weight lifting has amazing health benefits. Studies show that even starting at the age of 80 will improve overall well being by a lot!", "It's a huge confident booster too. The positives creep into all aspects of life.", " He won't come near me and my house can't hold another cat. I will feed him though. I have big dogs, so not sure if he'd come near my house :( I will try though!", "Oh, I would never! I am just so beyond full with the same type! lol- And cats don't like to be packed in. I have seperate areas for my nice cats and mean cats and it's still a touchy balance! If I had a bigger house, I would help even more. They are so innocent! Our local AC doesn't do cats and I wouldn't want him pts anyway but I will always feed animals in need", "Me either- don't ever move to california..So many little dogs pts daily..I would become a total hoarder lol.

I just went yesterday!", "I can't wait to move and have a hook up.", "I do. My daughter has been talkong t me for abot 20 minutes. She knows that I'm not lisstening. yet she continues", "I know!

I really like \"Don't Starve\" by Klei.", "Oooh my friends have been playing that, maybe I should get it too", "Oh no, that must have been pretty awful. Do you not have self checkout at your grocery store?", "If it makes you feel any better, I bet that happens a lot to the cashier. They probably didn't think twice or care as long as you weren't a jerk.", "I deal with anxiety myself, so I know not thinking about it is easier said than done.

It'll happen to you too!", "Those good old times of fantasy. Kid's world is so full of imagination and self-scaring created things", "Here is an idea. Why don't you get yourself a teddy bear by your side when sleeping. He will protect you", "Oh no!  How old is he/she?", "Yeah I understand.  Is there anywhere you can take it to get it fixed?", "haha no!   Taking my neice and nephew to the amusement park!  ", "No I wish!  I've never ridden a roller coaster EVER!!!", "Oh no! That is one of my biggest fears!  What did you do?", "I sure hope you get to keep your job.  I know it was a big accident, but it was an accident.", "Oh no, I know that is so disappointing first hand.  The same thing has happened to me for the last three years.  Is everything going well, though?", "That is a real bummer.  Maybe you can have a makeup vacation in September.", "I hope it went well!! she is alright now right?", "that's just nice of you!! helping out your sister!!", "Congrats! That is great news!", "I bet! You deserve to be proud and excited though. You have worked hard for this.", "That's so scary! I hope your dog is OK.", "I can imagine. Glad you are both alright.", "Eh, you'll get there eventually. Besides, big houses aren't even that great! All you need is a moderate amount of space to live comfortably.", "And that's the best part. Many of those folks with nice houses have mountains of debt. It causes a lot of stress.", "Well, since he's supposed to be IN the water, you may have a fatality on your hands.", "Yeah, you'd better find him like quick!

What will happen if it doesn't come on time?", "I really hope that it comes on time.  It can be so disappointing when something like that ruins your perfect plans.", "Sorry to hear that. Have you tried to explain your side of things to your boss?", "Hopefully this type of situation doesn't happen again. That really is disappointing how the system doesn't protect the employees about that type of situation.", "That is funny what did she do?", "That is amazing I guess she deserves to be spoon fed!", "That sounds relaxing", "i hope you have many more", "Ugh, that's always the worst. I hope it wasn't something urgent you were waiting on?", "Yeah, I've had them do that to me before too. It's a pain in the keester.", "OMG...I know what you mean. I can't stand for anything to crawl on me or near me. Did you see any?", "LOL....Their waiting for you to let your guard down and then they will attack you.", "Oh my god!

I am glad to hear that you got to use your Baywatch-esque skills!", "That's great man. You just have to wrestle a few sharks and they'll appoint you head lifeguard of the state.", "I don't know if that is a good thing or a bad thing, but either way it is EPIC.", "It is hard to recover from a binge like that, but do a few thousand situps and you'll be good as new!", "That really sucks. Did you make it up to your co-worker?", "That's good to hear that you and your co-worker mad amends. Live and learn!", "Whoa! Did you have a strong craving or something?", "That's okay to give in sometimes and enjoy the moment. ", "Oh, that must be stressful. Do you think he is going to be fine?", "Oh, that must be stressful. Do you think he is going to be fine?", "All you must have been proud of yourself", "That's so terrible. How could they ditch you!!", "That is pretty awesome, was it something you really wanted?", "You should write a good review, sounds like they know what they are doing.", "That's kinda terrible. Did you apologize to him?", "Well, as long as you did and the wife doesn't know, you're in the clear!", "oh no, that's teribble", "he should do his work properly. He is such a naughty boy to do on the rug!!", "Dang! I bet that feeling felt incredible! Did you guys celebrate?", "Well, that's kinda meh. But congratulations still!", "That is awesome.  Is this for college?", "You must be feeling great.  What are you studying?", "I'm trying to do the whole work-from-home and be-your-own-boss thing. That contentment doesn't last long!

Have you tried putting up posters?", "No doubt he will when he gets cold and hungry. ", "That's great! What was it?", "He will be rich one day!", "That was rude of them.

I wish i had one like that", "Good you should be for having such a blesses neighbor", "That is so cool!", "That is crazy!  Most kids first words are \"money\".", "Pretty savvy place! Were you working on your 1000 page manuscript for 10 hours, squatting for free internet?", "That's great! I go there almost every single day and get a bread bowl!", "I too feel your pain. I broke my diet by eating 4 dozen donuts in one sitting. ", "We'll get back on the horse together, my friend. Skinnier days are ahead of us!", "That sounds like a nice and relaxing day. What book were you enjoying?", "It's really cool to have those moments where you get to enjoy what you like to do.", "Woah how did you manage to eat 12 pizzas", "oh oh. It's alright next time you should be bit careful not eat a lot", "Oh man! A rookie mistake! Did your date notice the foul stench?", "Well, I guess it didn't turn out too bad.

What was it, that must of been pretty wild.", "hmm, that is a pretty epic first world. You would think that would be a little two difficult for a first word. The kid must be a genius", "I hope too !! I think you will do well!!", "omg!! millionaire that works at McDonalds. I would like to see you work ", "Dang. Do you have the whole house to yourself?", "That's really rough. Maybe you should go to the gym and meet some friends?", "That is funny. Dogs can be careless. You should take better care of it", "You seem to be very fed up with him. How long have you had him?", "It makes me feel the same. That's why I voted for myself in the last election.", "Truly unacceptable. We would be better off with chimpanzees in office.", "He did!

I really hate driving off only to find out a third of your order is wrong or missing!", "Good thing your boss was available. I would not worry about being embarrassed.

I saved up for 4 months but then had a massive car repair bill..", "I know. My advice is take it seriously just in case", "That's so frustrating! Do you know who it is?", "Sorry to hear that.

Are you alright now?", "Fine. Have a joyful life ahead!", "A hike in your package? I'm sorry, I don't follow. As in how long it would take to get there to you?", "Ohh.. I see! I'm sorry to hear that. I've never had the personal experience of having to do so, but sometimes people really have to argue and advocate for themselves to get the things they feel they've earned and deserved, like a salary raise.

Unfortunately, you can only do that inside :(", "Hah.. that's a very interesting point", "Glad to hear your life took a turn.

I have a hard time sitting for long hours too. What are you looking in too?", "Thats a job that is needed for sure. You could also try and get a degree in programming- it usually only takes a year?

Makes it hard when my mower was stolen as well..which the police do nothing about..instead of ticketing decent people, they should try and stop all the rapes and shootings in the area and deal with all the abandoned houses", "They just want to make easy money.

That had to be really stressful too though", "that is not good, do you have any idea why you spaced out", "dont worry about it it happens to everyone it is nothing to be ashamed of", "No, not an Uber driver.

I could not live like that long term.", "That must have been painful and a little embarrassing!", "Probably they just fell bad for you, thank god it was not worse.", "Yikes. I live in the south and we don't get those. Just palmetto bugs (flying roaches). I think I'd rather have those than rats, personally.", "My girlfriend has complained about rats too, since she lives in the midwest. Says she'll be taking out the trash and she'll hear them scurrying and it will freak her out. Good luck to you guys who have to deal with the little disease-infested things..", "I'm so proud of you! That's a lot to deal with all at once! ", "It's worth it! It'll teach you a lot that you'll use later in life ", "That's very sad. My Grandma had that and it is devastating to experience it. I'm told that doing puzzles etc. keeps the brain active and maybe at least delays it.", "I really feel for you. It's not easy, I won't kid you. But at least you understand what's happening and are obviously prepared for the inevitable.", "I hear you there, it can be more relaxing spending time at home thang going to a hectic party. ", "Will your friend be disappointed with you?", "I would be so excited! I'm so proud of you! ", "Hopefully you have some wine to celebrate with! ", "that's annoying. maybe you should try giving them a call again?", "i completely understand, i hope they will call you soon so you won't have to", "Oh. Do you have to buy a lot of presents or do you just not know what to buy?", "I understand. You know there are websites were you can answer a few questions about the person you are buy a gift for and then it makes gift recommendations for that person.", "Yeah, I have tried it a few times. It suggests some pretty cool things too.", "Oh wow! That usually doesn't happy, usually that feeling fades with time. ", "It sounds like you have a keep of a place to go!", "Wow that's awesome. You must be feeling pretty content.", "You did things right. You will be able to retire one day on your current track.", "That's pretty cool to hear. When I have kids, I hope they're the same, and can get into sports, since it offers so much. Good for you for getting them into sports", "It'd be cool if she made it to the stage where she could play the World Cup.. I feel like that's such a cool sporting event, and if you had your child in that, that'd create some kind of family legacy.", "Did you bring it in and take care of it?", "That's very kind of you. Too often people neglect stray animals and they suffer terrible short lives.", "Did the neighbors come after you?", "Maybe or at least recovered your basketball!", "Tell him you had to go to the store!", "How nice! Are you going out or are you going to have a nice night in?", "Thats great. I hope you both enjoy yourselves.", "Congratulations! I am sure you are very happy and beeming with pride right now. Whats the next step for her?", "Excellent! Any scholarships in the future?", "How scary!

Did it bring back good memories?", "I'm very sorry for your loss. I'm glad you have the letter from him though.", "I guarantee you know more than you think! Just be methodical and you'll do just fine.", "Everyone needs a math genius friend, lol. At least, you do if you're as hopeless at math as I am!", "oh im so sorry you felt this way! I hope your mood will get better. maybe watch a good comedy?", "i understand how you feel though. i would feel lonely but i would definitely do something fun like play video games or watch movie", "That's terrible.. There's nothing more frustrating and deflating in life than unexpected expenses. I hope you're able to cover all of it. I know if I had one right now, I might not be able to manage it.", "I hope you can. If you think there's even a chance, then give it a shot, if it will save you that much money. My brother watches Youtube videos all the time of how to fix random things, and it seems to work for him. If you're the type of person that can learn that way, and if you have the patience, then I think it's a good thing to try.", "What was she so negative?", "What kind of dog is it?", "Oh that's terrible, getting delayed always annoys me", "Oh yes that sounds a little dangerous I wouldn't take that flight unless it was necessary. ", "That sounds so nice! I love to be with my dog outside too, even if just watching him play.", "Yes!v and a good exercise too!", "that's great, what did you have for lunch? i had some hot dogs and baked beans", "i love chicken alfredo! so delicious. I wish i could nap too lol i'm a mom, moms don't nap", "I was able to go about 1.7 the normal speed. It's like that stuff gave me wings or something.", "Yea, I might start keeping them on hand anytime I do a sporting event!", "You know there is one thing that might make it even better.", "Yea, but have you ever experienced wings before?", "I wish i could go to my old high school. i moved far from it but if i come back i will visit", "i bet! High school was fun. We couldn't wait to become adults lol", "Ewww. I hate it when dog owners don't pick up after their pets. We always carried a poop bag with us for when our pooch \"went\".", "No, they're not, and it's not just in this country. Europe is terrible for dog poo in the streets!", "Thats amazing! he must really really love you.", "Well atleast he did what he could to show you he cares.", "That's pretty gross. Were there other people around? I'm always more nervous about that when people are around.", "That sounds horrifying. Pretty sure I would die.", "Haha oh no. Sometimes you need a cheat day.", "Maybe next time have a huge meal before you start baking. That way you arent hungry. ", "It's good to be confident. I am sure you will get some good news soon.", "You did great. Just wait and don't stress about it.", "Wow! Was your order important? Have you called the post office to find out what happened?", "Well that's good. I hope her makes it before the end of the day and you get your package.", "Awe! Hopefully they were cute pictures", "Growing up sucks! Lmao", "Congratulations! It's not easy moving to a new place, but it's great fun getting to know your new home!", "That takes a lot of courage. I'm proud of you! I moved last year and it's both fun and scary at the same time", "Did you wind up eating it?", "lol, you are such a nice person. I would have definately kicked that guy out!", "I plan to receive a present from my wife of this drone that I like.", "She better!", "That is terrifying, did you get away from it?", "That is good, who knows if the dog has rabies or not. It would be unpleasant to get bit! ", "Have you been expecting it long? ", "Oh no!! I hope it comes soon. I know how that it to be waiting for money to come. ", "You dont like to gossip at all?", "I understadn that, Others business is a very sensitive subject", "Is this brother of your's a lot younger than you are?", "Would you say your relationship is like the one in that movie, Brother Bear?", "I got lots and lots of presents!", "I will never tell..", "You must miss her. But I'm sure she'll be back before you know it!", "She must like to travel. Have you ever gone with her?", "Well thats disappointing. Maybe you can find a show similar to it to watch. ", "I know what you mean. It seems they keep the crap shows going for years and the good ones get cancelled. ", "Did you flip the bird? Some people are so rude.", "You should also post the license plate on social media. Sometimes public shaming does wonders.", "Well it's a teacher's goal to make sure his or her students succeed.  She wants you to do your best.", "It's always good when you have a teacher who cares and puts forth the effort to help you as much as possible.", "Must feel good to get it over with. How do you think you did?", "That is great. You must have been very confident up there.", "Yes! I bet it will, did you go in and kill it?", "What is the job, will you like it?", "Thats amazing, I have actually had that happen to be before in my life, I was so happy", "Thats right, taht makes me so happy to know", "What did you fail?", "How many times have you tried?", "I almost feel like homework is counter productive. Shouldn't the schools be teaching the kids enough during their 8 hours?", "I guess you're right. Education isn't something that can be rushed! But still, I think homework is a little excessive.", "I'm sure there'll be other games it will be useful for.", "I built my own too a few years ago.", "At times, though I don't have as much time anymore.", "That's a shame, do you have anything else lined up?", "There'll probably be something else", "Is that a bad thing?", "That's good", "Oh that cinnabon smell can be so enticing!", "That sounds so good. I haven't had one in forever.", "Oh man! I would be so excited! When do you go?", "Man that's going to be so awesome! ", "Talk crap get smacked", "Is this a true story", "mcdonalds is honestly gross to me though, rich or poor. i dont eat it.", "Thatnks, just a matter of preference I guess.", "oh my god, thats it so gross, cat pee is the worst.", "im so sorry,  thats why im not the biggest fan of animals.", "That sounds like quite a ride. Are you a fan of rollercoasters in general?", "I understand that. I hate rollercoasters too.", "That is great to hear. Anything new going on?", "I wish I were so content. Must be a nice feeling.", "Did it do much damage to your car ?", "Well, I hope they had insurance at least.", "Dang, that really blows. What was it made of, glass?", "They should use metal. That never breaks. Sorry that happened to you.", "Did you get up to go check to see what it was?", "Thats absoulty terrifying to be honest.", "How long did it take? ", "Doesn't sound too bad", "That's awesome. What band is it?", "Never heard of it. I hope it was a good show!", "It's hard for kids to do that. Maybe he was just bored?", "It's hard for kids to do that. Maybe he was just bored?", "Oh no, I bet she ends up loving it!  Best of luck!", "Oh nice!  What kind of phone did you get?", "Think of all the mindless browsing you can do now!", "Oh, now that's exciting! Do you have any plans to do it? Celebrating with anyone?", "That's wonderful! I'm happy for you. Hopefully he got you something meaningful, sentimental, and long-lasting so that you can keep on enjoying it!", "Honestly that will end up being a lot better in the long run anyway, won't it?

What is your idea?", "That sounds like a really cool idea. I hope that it turns out well!", "We are very confident she will! Thankfully they caught it early, but the treatment is just really difficult.", "That is wonderful! Luckily for her, because of her chemo site she won't loose her hair. ", "Thank you! ", "Why's that? ", "I'd imagine it feels pretty nostalgic", "Oh no! If it helps they probably don't remember. That stuff filters out faster than you would think!", "Well, I feel for ya! I'm a very clumsy person myself, trip all the time.", "Im sure they understand. That is a tough position to be in.", "Maybe try and reach out on social media to a few of them. Im sure they would love to hear from you.", "Did he hurt the baby? Most of the time they are just curious ", "Yeah, that's what they do. Hahaha", "Aww, did you take it home with you? It's great to adopt strays.", "Then I am sure the cat is yours. Enjoy your ball of fur!", "I totally understand that feeling. It's very frustrating. All you can do is try your best and try not to pay too much attention to that aspect.", "I think we all have our good days and bad days. Just keeping plugging along and I bet it gets better soon. It recently did for me.", "That sucks.", "I know how you feel. Keep your head up. Start putting out more applicaitons.", "Nope, put it all in the bank.

So she has that experience.", "Even more awesome is that she is only 22 years old, I was highly impressed, but she must have been at the right place at the right time!", "That really sucks, I've had that happen to me as well.", "I agree, most don't bother with something so simple like throwing away trash or returning grocery carts or holding open doors.", "That really stinks. Maybe you should try and find something that your good at and do that!", "What do you think you are really good?", "Cool!

Just try and stay productive as much as possible.", "Wow, that must be exciting. Do you have everything prepared?", "Nice! Make sure to take lots of photos and make some cool memories together!", "Whoa, that is quite the confession. But you know, it's good that you recognize that you need to change a behavior. Very mature. Not everyone has that same ability to be honest with themselves, and you should feel proud about that!", "I know, and I know it can be really hard to deal with that guilt. You want to solve the problem though, and that's still worth something. Being able to take the little victories will go a long way toward the goal you want in terms of how you treat your husband.", "I've always gone by if you learned from your mistakes you have no reason to regret them", "It's good you've grown and learned. Never stop ", "Oh that is awful. I have been fired before it is just the worst. Have things gotten better since then?", "It defintiely sounds bad.", "That is good.

It is one of my favorites.", "Just wear cologne, dress sharp, use mouthwash, and let her do all the talking.  And you'll be just fine", "That's good.  Just stay away from the beans and spicy food haha", "That sounds awesome! I wish I could go!", "That sounds like a really good time. It will be like you are a kid again!", "Aw I am sorry to hear that. I'm sure he was a good pet.", "Oh wow. Pets can be just like family members. It's hard to lose them I know.", "Why? What are you worried about?", "Just try to relax and not worry so much. Yes something bad could happen but there's also a chance nothing goes wrong. Having anxiety about something can be hard to overcome but you can do it :)", "I loved playing that!  They look so outdated now.  Good times!", "That must have been the most epic Christmas ever!

", "haha, well maybe they didn't want to embarass you.", "I guess things only go on sale for a reason.", "IT was literally the next day :|", "this is the first in a line of tests that i have to do. i'm dying on the inside a little bit", "girl part problems.", "thank you. i hope so too. i'm terrified.", "That is so exciting, how long do you have to wait tell you find out if you are accepted or not?", "I am sure you have worked very hard to get to this place! ", "That is great news!  I am sure he feels a great deal of accomplisment", "I hope he enjoys his new job and can celebrate", "That sounds so annoying!", "I hope they finish up soon. That could drive someone crazy going on for so long.", "Really? How come?", "That is very disappointing. Maybe next time text or talk on the phone a little bit to see if you will have something in common.", "How old are you?", "Ah ok, it is fine", "Oh no! What do you think had happened or triggered it?", "Hope she recovers and feels better overall soon. That can be quite the scare!", "They are really impressive.  What circus was it?", "Have you ever gotten to go to a Cirque du Soliel?  If you like acrobats you would love that!", "Did you call the police?", "I suggest a Night Owl surveillance system.", "That's the worst. I have that happen all the time but with onions.

I had too much spinal fluid in my brain for a while and was working on resolving that wihtout need for really heavy medication.", "Oh I feel you! I have full control over my schedule, it is so nice!", "Part time self employed and part time just employed by a company. The company lets me choose my shifts though so... still full control.", "oh wow, that does suck! Hopefully you can push it to another day this week.", "Defenitly, and employers can be unreasonable sometimes.", "Thats awesome what kind of car is it.", "have you always wanted a jeep they seem pretty fun to drive.", "Did the entire class laugh at you?", "I haven't peed my pants ever. Guess I am just lucky.", "Why did your dog do it.", "My Japanese spitz did that once...lady was waving a bone around and pulling back...til he caught her with one snap and almost bit her finger clean off", "You must be a little jealous.  Maybe its time to save up for your own dream car?", "I mean pro's and con's... right?", "No i'm just boozeless tonight :(", "I think i'll live, and save a few calories.", "Oh boy I hope you get some sleep tonight!", "you got it bro!", "Did you know all the answers?

But that's wonderful to hear!", "What happens next.", "Well I guess it worked itself out. ", "I undersand. Do you want to strangle me?", "Good.", "How come?", "That does sound scary.  I would have used my phone flashlight", "brought back some old memories?", "thats nice", "Kinda tough to condense,  shared file access across multiple people where a network drive wouldn't work.   We had something in place for that but not many people know about it.  So i had to setup some stuff and train 4 people.", "haha, thanks", "What talents do you speak of?", "That's pretty cool.   Do you go to the circus often?", "That's amazing to hear.  There is nothing like a great relationship!", "Bad ones definatley make the good one a treasure.  Have you been together long?", "That is a good long time!  I am sure you have many more ahead of you!", "When you appreciate something that much it's sure to continue that way!  I've been married 19 years and love almost every minute!", "Ah, that's unfortunate. That can be really tough to remember sometimes. I know because I've forgotten that too. But you'll make it up as soon as you can, I'm sure!", "As long as it's not too delinquent, and you have an otherwise good history of on-time payments, you should be okay! Try talking to your loan servicer, too. They can help.", "Did they leave a note or anything?  I would be really upset too.  Were there any cameras that could have seen who did it?", "Thats the worst.  I would feel so awful if I left a dent and fleed the scene of the crime.

Did anyone else see it happen?", "I'm sure the other people thought kids will be kids.  He'll learn eventually!", "Now that's just not right!

Ah- Well cherish them while you can in the summers even though it can be tiring :)", "Well that's pretty annoying. Aren't they supposed to have people there who do that for you?", "If that happens again, you should tell them they should have to pay you the appropriate wage to do work that they're supposed to be doing themselves. That's insane!", "It's about life of course! I could handle it if it were demons and ghosts..but real life nightmares...Unpleasant.

Maybe it can be used as motivation", "I am sure you are at least happy for your friend, right?", "I have done that. It happens to the best of us", "I am sure no one really noticed", "oh that was awkward", "probably the best option", "What kind of pet is it?", "No way! They scare me :( Is it easy?", "Ready for what?", "Great. What is the test about?", "Thats not fair! what has he done that you havent done?", "Thats so annoying.  Ive been in a similar situation.

I sold it a couple years ago", "I wonder if there are any repair shops that could fix it", "What happened? Are you ok?", "I mean they could have just run your items instead of making you mad.", "I bet you were anxious to know how you did! Did you study up with friends or family leading up to the driver's test?", "Oh well that's a bit different of a situation, lol. I gotcha! I didn't know you had to retake the test if you accidentally let it expire. But I'm sure you did great!", "That's awesome! I'm proud of you, buddy.", "Oh sweet.

Don't be so hard on them they're not always gonna be around ;)", "You must have a good, positive energy and that's what they miss.  I used to be the same.  But when they're dead and gone you'll miss the pestering so love them for who they are, you're still free to make your own choices. Peace", "Do you make them for a living or as a hobby?", "I've never even attempted something so huge. You must be very creative and precise.

No one available to walk you part way or anything?", "Did anything happen?", "Sounds like a lot of fun! I'm sure it'll be a great date to bond.", "Yes defenitly! Go on the ferris wheel and buy her some cotton candy :)", "Aw, that's sweet. What kind of pet is it? Did you wish you could steal it so it could be yours instead?", "Hmm, I don't think I've ever known anyone who has a bearded dragon before actually. That's really cool though! Did you let the two of y'alls bearded dragons ever interact?", "Why?", "Ah ah, have fun.", "That is so cool, what was the project?", "That is so awesome, so it was a real life advanced battle bots.  So amazing.  Congratulations!", "You must be so excited!", "I hope you have a great time!", "How did you do that?", "Wow, that's awful but you know, we all make dumb mistakes like that in desperate times.", "That is so wonderful that you give your parents the credit and are so grateful for what they did for you!", "I hope my kids say the same thing about me helping them that much when they grow up.", "You must cook a lot of tasty food all the time!", "hmm did you try calling pest control", "yea thats true", "i wish i could do that too", "Why were you scared", "Yeah, that does sound a little scary", "Good for you.

", "4 is still a baby for me...but i'd start treating him like a man", "That's funny.", "I love hondas.  Are you jealous of that person?", "I know that feeling, friend.", "Is it for a special event?", "I hope you are able to get it done in time - I love cheesecake so I'm jealous I won't be there to eat it!", "I would say medium sized but they always catch me off guard because I don't see them.", "Not everyday, but more than I prefer.", "That's awesome, she sounds multi faceted.", "That's human, when you live for a while you don't have to get stuff right the first time.", "Oh yeah baby, that sounds awesome. I don't know what it is, but those \"buy in bulk\" stores' food cafes always have INSANE pizza. I'm jealous!", "Believe me, I've eaten my fair share of it. My stepmom used to take me and my brother there when we were younger. I'll always have fond memories of it.

It's been raining here everyday.", "I hope you get some sun where you are, too. Too much rain can get depressing.", "Now that is one of the most unfortunate things I've heard all week. How did you get it out of your hair? Eeww", "That, I think, is a pretty justifiable response honestly, lol. Now at the very least all you'll have to do is clean the umbrella!", "Yup and I'm only 26 :)", "I'm winning at life everyday and that's how it's gonna be", "Oohh...if you're the girl that's ok...if you're a guy c'mon buddy, bring some cash lol", "Tsk tsk gotta have a backup.

Why did you take it may I ask?", "Ah, well if you haven't sold it yet, there's still time to return it!", "where were you all going to go ?", "oh that sounds like fun", "Why were you scared?", "I feel like I have heard that a lot tonight", "Why are you surprised she asked you out? ", "A lot of girls don't follow the traditional ways anymore.", "It is kind of odd to look at ourselves from that long ago, and we didn't even realize what we looked like usually at that time.", "It's like you're looking at someone else almost.", "Why did they cancel", "I guess work does that sometimes", "Impressive! It is all going to be well worth it in the long run, keep going ghost rider!", "If theres a will then theres a way! Er in most situations, were not talking about you trying to do brain surgery tomorrow or anything. ", "Haha. That would have scared me so much.", "You never know with those cats. They are very sly.", "Oh I hope it does! I bet you've got a super secret ingredient that makes it stand out from the rest of the rabble.", "Then it will be appropriate if it pays off for you. If you win first prize, I'm gonna need you to start getting it put in grocery stores so I can buy some!", "what does she say ?", "sounds scary", "oh no. this sounds bad.", "I'm so sorry to hear that. Have you tried calling your local shelther or animal control?", "Oh, sometimes you just have to accept weather changing your plans. I am sure you can go another time.", "That's a bummer. Well I hope you can find another weekend to make up for it.", "wow. a cruise sounds pretty amazing. where to?", "Oh man.

Me too. What area are you in?", "Northeast here. Must be raining all along the coast.", "Are you happy with that", "I guess it was just meant to be then", "Omg that is awful. How long did it take to recover? ", "I bet! I am glad it wasn't even for serious than it was already.", "I know, I can't wait either!", "I am rooting for the Longhorns!", "I guess people are way more rude these days arent they", "I do miss that as well, maybe it will come back", "Oh, that's got to feel rough. It's not quite the same, but I've felt similarly when I couldn't get previous ex-girlfriends gifts during holidays or their birthdays or something. But I'm sure she knows you love her anyway.", "It does. Feeling bad about it is enough to show you care about her, which is something, paradoxically, to feel good about I think. Just keep being a good dad to her. :)", "That is great. How old is she?", "At this age, they are cute.", "You couldn't say no to working?", "That is a real bummer.  I'm sorry that happened to you.  Will you be able to reschedule your plans?", "I am sorry it didn't work out. But happy to hear you are happy now.", "That is so wonderful, because that doesn't normally happen.", "Annoying is an understatment.

They got to eat McDonalds lol", "Oh no, I hate when that happens", "Good luck, lots of coffee!", "I think it is, that might make you feel better", "Its the perfect time to go see them then", "That is tough. Was it a big lie?", "You must be feeling pretty guilty. That sucks. ", "What kind of test was it", "I am sure you will do better next time", "Oh gross! That must have been disgusting to see.", "Wow, I can only imagine what other gross things she does.", "Is that a video game?  Is it Mario?", "I used to LOVE Mario Kart - I'm not a big video game fan but I loved that one.  I can see why you are excited about it coming out!", "What exactly did you see?", "Wow that's very annoying, he should be arrested.", "Wow, how amazing is that!? I wish someone would do that for me! I mean, I don't think I buy more than $30 of groceries at a time since it's just me, but still!", "That's a wonderful idea, I love that! And you know, if you find you can't quite do the exact same thing for someone else, you can always donate food to a food bank or something. It's the exact same thing, and it'll make you feel awesome.", "Oh that sucks! Maybe you can go the next day.", "Do you normally go very often?", "oh wow! that is horrible!! did they get away with it?", "i am sorry to hear that. that is a bad incident to have happen on vacation", "That is so exciting.  Is this your first?", "I guess you have a plan to induce labor, or a scheduled C-section?", "Oh, Do you think you did something wrong? ", "That's terrible I wouldn't like for that to happen to me.", "We went to a Shaker Village museum.  I had made planes via email with the location I thought we were headed toward.  LOL.  I was emailing a second location two hours further!  We were so nervous because now I didn't know what to expect!", "No.  We stayed at the first location and had a great time!  But it really made for an adventure, for sure!", "My new AC unit is leaking... I've got water dripping from my ceiling.", "It better.", "I am!. IT only took two days of school", "IT will be bittersweet. Trust me", "That's great.", "I know how that feels. Its a good feeling to be on the right path finally", "That sounds like a neat tradition. What did you guys do with the apples once they were all picked?", "Sounds like a bunch of tasty items! My mom used to make a banging apple pie whenever I came home for Thanksgiving. It was the best feeling in the world eating it.", "That is amazing!  I'm so happy for you!  What kind of car did they get you?", "Hey, a new car is a new car!  I'm dying from heat in my car since the A/C broke.  Have fun driving!", "That's awesome! How long do you think it will take you to build it?", "Is this the first time you've put a computer together?", "Ah, I know that feeling well. My family moved around a ton while I was in grade school, so I don't really have many long term friends. Don't worry though, you'll make friends at your new job so easily, you won't even remember you didn't have friends!", "I mean yeah, it can't hurt, can it? I'm sure they'll be excited to meet you and get to know you as much as vice versa. Plus, who knows?

Do you have friends to turn to?", "Well thats good. If you can find a hobby to occupy those evenings that would be best.", "Oh no!  Are you hurt?  Don't even worry about them. It happens to the best of us.", "I'm glad you're okay.  It is so embarrassing.  I've done that before but at least you got back up!  Pride can heal and a body takes longer to! ", "I bet! I am still too scared to ride one.", "Maybe I should get over my fear and finally ride one.", "That's really sweet of him. How long have you been friends?", "What do you guys like to do for fun?", "Aw, that's too bad. What kind of restaurant was it?", "Dang, what I would do for some sweet chinese now. Did you find one to replace it?", "I'm sorry to hear that. Adolph must've had a happy life though.", "Man. What was it like having a armadillo as a pet?", "That's really sad. Were you close to him?", "I am sorry to hear that. I was pretty distraught when I lost my granddad as well. May he rest in peace.", "It sounds like a big opportunity for you.  Are you ready for it?", "Good luck, I'm sure you will do well.", "What in the world.

How do you handle it?", "I generally tend to start walking away from them.", "Holy cow! I think I would have passed out if I was you!", "Oh wow, You probably shouldn't be drinking and driving tho.", "I am sure that makes you feel bad, have you talked to them about how you feel?", "That is a sticky situation to be in", "Oh I'm glad you got it!

Nintendo or Atari or Sony?", "Sounds like you had a great childhood, you can try playing it now by downloading an emulator haha, I tried that and it was great", "thats nice of you to rely on a friend.", "then you got good set of friends. Don't lose them for your life!!", "Alright, I can get behind that. Sisters-in-law are usually angry messes of human beings anyway, so I'll back you up on that.

I have a bonus son (my son's best friend) who has been in the Navy for about a year now.", "That's a nice commitment.  My father is an Air Force veteran.  I'm not too fond of the military, but it definitely makes a difference in the lives of many.", "That's a great era!  I went through a rock n roll phase around 1984-1986.  My favorite music era is the 70s.  I love the bands. Old school music is the best for me.", "I'm a 70's baby not old at all but I find myself longing for my childhood days.  They were the best of days even in the world.", "Ugh, tell me about it. Her and Trump both make me feel that way.", "He doesn't really say anything of substance in my opinion. Just vague words. But hey, to each his own!", "I usually go and visit her, but she does come over pretty often too. We have a close relationship. I really have a lot to thank her for.", "That's a great idea! I do enjoy cooking. I learned from her and my grandmother. I'm from the South so we know how to cook delicious cajun cuisine!", "I am sure a B or A- is just as good.  Which class was it?", "Ohhh that's a hard subject. I struggled with physics a lot, but not as much as chemistry.", "That's so lucky! How much did you win?", "That's a good amount, cool!", "Are you going to see her again?", "I thought you hit it off thou?", "wow i would be so sad if i saw that", "yea i would die if i saw that", "Oh god, what happened?", "I'm glad you are okay.

So are you a teacher or substitute or what?", "What kind of math do you teach?", "What did you steal from him?", "Why don't you return it?", "Same, especially being as attractive as he is.", "He pretty much has everything at this point.", "Where and when did this happen?  I haven't looked at the news lately to avoid hearing sad news.  The last incident of the duck boat accident was very saddening.", "Oh wow.  I will definitely need to look at that.  Was there many casualties?", "I'm not sure about all, but I do see a rise in those being home schooled to ensure the safety of the children.  However, not all parents are equipped with the ability to home school. ", "That's interesting.  I wonder if the teacher's salary would be impacted by implementing your idea.  It's already a challenge to pay teachers what they deserved.  I think that good home training is necessary so that the child will know how to act when they are at school.", "I love tacos! Do they serve other mexican food?", "Sounds delish! I really like Moes southwest grill. If you get the chance you should try it.", "Sorry to hear that, will you get another dog?", "Do you have any other pets?", "That's non fun. I'm sorry to heard that. Maybe you shouldn't go there anymore?", "The food is not very healthy so you are not missing much", "thats no fun! i love to swim and be in the pool or beach. but i work too much to go", "yes you should. its not hard!", "I love cruises, where is your cruise headed?", "Have you ever been there before?", "Sorry to hear that.

When is/was your birthday?", "My daughter just had a nice birthday dinner with family.  My granddaughter had a couple of parties. What kind of party do you plan on having?", "Definitely, you have a good point there.  I love my peaceful moments.  I just have very brief moments when I think of them all at home.", "Indeed they do, It was just my youngest daughter and I for about a year.  My son and daughter have come back for a spell to get a break from adulting.  They wasn't ready!", "Have you ever talked on the phone at movies yourself?", "Well Its always fun to get the people on their phones thrown out of the movie theater", "That's awful!

Do you have test results pending?", "Well what you should do first is be with your family and those who care about you.", "Cool, where did you go?", "This is a trail where you can walk for months?", "I love coming home too. ", "I just love relaxing here. My favourite thing is no neighbours !", "Cyber security ", "It is interesting ", "Is this your first time?  I know that is something that I would even ever consider.  My fear of heights would render me completely lifeless.  So are you doing the real skydiving or in one of these indoor skydiving places?", "Well, I am working my way up to taking a flight across the oceans perhaps one where I'm in a plane in the sky for over 8 hours.  Outside of that, I will give it to you that you are really brave.", "If your son is very young and you give him an allowance then tie it to that!", "Haha sadly it does not. I still hold off on doing it in my own apartment at 26. Unless they are very young I don't think here really is a good way unless it smells", "I was siiting beside a girl on the transit bus and she expelled gas and it stunk so bad that the person on the other side of her vomited ,5 minutes later she had the nerve to try and flirt with me and tried to get my phone number.", "no i was to busy trying to block any future memory of what just happened out of my memory ", "man what happened next, i would have been looking for a place to hide", "I bet that was a relief and pretty funny when you look back on it.", "They definitely like me there.", "Everyone does get along well.", "That's great for your sister, but you must have felt left out.", "Did she invite you another year?", "Did you have fun when you got to go?", "I guess learning to appreciate positives and get past negatives is part of life :)", "What instrument do they yplay?", "Oh that's great! You must be very proud.", "do you have all your gear ready to go ?", "that sounds fun but dangerous at the same time, is it ?", "Oh no!

I would be very disappointed too.", "I like it too, but I was surprised at hers because it made me want to change my order.", "I had a cheeseburger.", "Lol that sounds wild, did you text them something appropriate?", "Hopefully he can take constructive criticism, I think more people should be open to that.", "That's the worst! What did you do?", "Saved you the money from having to call pop a lock.", "No I have 3, he is my youngest son.", "Yes they do. In a way I'm grateful because it is peaceful.", "I just cannot understand why people won't do their job properly, I had to cut my lunch break in order to do more work", "That is so sad, they don't seem to understand workers.", "It was her credit card, I borrowed it without telling her", "I wanted to purchase something and I did not have any money, so I used her card.", "Oh wow, that sounds unfortunate. Is there no way to ask the neighbor to take it easy?", "That sounds terrible. I hate to hear single mothers dealing with extra problems like these. If anything I would advise your son to be careful and defend himself.", "Aw, good on her. I bet she knew exactly how it would make you feel, too. Things people do personally themselves always have the better result.", "Now it's your turn! Surprise her with something that will remind her of something special too. People hate to hear it, but our parents are only with us for so long, and when they're gone we have so many regrets. Use that as a motivator", "I know that feeling, so frustrating!  Do you think there's a chance the person will change?", "I'm sorry!  Maybe you could try distancing yourself from this person, you have to protect yourself first.", "Oh god..They do that to me TOO! And we have poison water! Are they going to fix it?", "Oh..the phone part is the worst! And being transferred and re-telling the story! I am glad they reversed it though! Most companies won't!", "I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have a plan to change things?", "That's terrible, but good for you for having a plan. You'll get through it, your happiness is the most important thing!", "Oh that is nice! Why did they move back?", "Oh fantastic! I am sure they are happy to be home.", "That happens sometimes but I'm sure you will make a lot of new friends in your new job.", "That is good, maybe you can still hang out with them outside of work.", "Could it be fixed at all? ", "I am sorry to hear that but luckily noone got hurt.", "I know how you feel... people also get married and have kids.", "Not sure I just aired it up then I had to jet to work.  I've got a small compressor. I'll deal with it later.", "Yep. I'm well prepared for those kind of things.", "That's great news! I find most people are good, honest folk. It's the few rotten ones that make us forget that.", "That's so nice of you. As I said, most people are very nice. You at least now have peace of mind.", "Wow, Did you see a doctor?", "That is good.", "Do you expect it to be positive?", "If your review is good, could you get a bonus?", "No, I don't like taking naps.", "I like to binge watch TV. How about you?", "That's great. Do you get a bonus?", "That's great. What do you sell?", "That must be such a relief to get another semester behind you. It's hard waiting to get your grades though I'm sure.", "Best wishes to you on your upcoming courses. I have a feeling you will be very successful.", "Well, it is good you have a friend that is so close to you that you feel comfortable sharing with them. ", "Trust is a hard thing to find, I am so glad you found this bond with this person.", "That's so annoying. Maybe you should leave earlier next time too.", "oh", "About what/", "I am not really a football fan but it is fun to be a part of something!", "Really?  What did they do to impress you so much?", "Wow!  That sounds amazing and complicated!  Now I understand why you were positively surprised!", "That is great. Did you watch all Harry Potter movies?", "I like also a lot Harry Potter movies.", "did it bring a lot of memories?", "yeah there's nothing like the good old days", "Well, that wasn't a very nice thing to do! Think of it as getting a new beard, rather than losing the old friend.", "I don't think you're overreacting. That is something important to you and they should have realized that. Maybe it's time for new friends?", "Yeah, I have a few \"friends\" like that. We hang out now and again, but there are others I'd rather spend my time with.", "My bridal shower. I thought I was just going over to have dinner there.", "Thank you!", "That must be stressful to your friend.", "That's good that you are content with what you have. ", "Omg that must have been really embarrassing. Did anyone came to your rescue?", "Haha. I can just imagine you running away. ", "No it wasn't and I wasn't expecting it because we are just mutual friends.", "Yes, and that day I was feeling rather sad. It cheered me up.", "Hows that working out for you.", "I once lost a wallet with a heavy sume of ash in it and I tried to have faith tht I would find it or some I trusted would find it and return it back to me.", "Well it happened at a realtives house I thought I could trust but I found out different and it made want  to pull my hair out.", "No they didn't return it and covered up that they took it.

Is he calling you?", "I understand.", "That's annoying. Have you talked to your boss about it?", "That can be tough. Hopefully she'll understand.", "Oh that is great! I have had great success doing keto and fasting for not feeling so hungry! Carbs and sugar do me in! What kind of lunches do you make?", "true! I don't mind the same things. You can do healthy, it just takes more prep and ingredients sometimes to do it tasty and healthy", "That's horrible! What happened to you? Who stabbed you in the back?", "That's really difficult to deal with. When you love someone, you lower your guard for that person and more than anyone else they're the ones that can hurt you the most. I hope you find a resolution to your problem.", "That sounds interesting, I would love to get a piercing. Where will you be getting the piercing?", "Darn it! I have never seen that before, now I am would like to see what it looks like", "I was so upset, I demanded a refund, which they refused to do. ", "I tried to do that, they gave me a hard time, eventually they decided to give me a refund", "Said he is the same as on the podcasts. Funny and smart", "Said he is the same as on the podcasts. Funny and smart", "Oh god, I hate flying. I always seem to get the plane that ends up having some issue.", "Yeah, I will drive almost anywhere rather than fly if I can.", "Haha.. I'm sorry, that made me laugh a little bit. I do that sometimes too, and have no idea how I can forget so many times. I think at least if it happens, almost no one can really tell or notice, if that helps.", "Well, you could have been going commando, too. And shame on them for not letting you know. Let's focus on the positives--you can pull off skinny jeans, and you're interesting enough to want to wear Superman underwear. Keep it up", "Did the company not pay you well enough?", "Well, that was a long time ago, I don't think you need to carry it around with you anymore, unless you're still doing it.", "Gross. What did you do?", "i think you could have removed them and still ate it. isnt that normal for them to have bugs in them sometimes?", "That is amazing! I bet she had to work hard for that.", "That's great. I think education is more important than ever", "I'm sorry to hear that, hopefully she naturally mellows out.", "Wow, that doesn't sound good. Situations like this are hard because you probably don't want to offend your family and stuff.", "How exciting!  I remember when my girls said their first words!

Something about it being easier than ma ma - congrats to the little tyke!", "Oh yes many sleepless nights. She is very deserving of that degree. ", "I hope she does. I am so happy for her", "I am so sorry that you have to go through that on your day off. Just try to be nice to her.", "Maybe you need to go to the store and bring her flowers and chocolate", "I don't envy you there. I have done the blind family meeting at a holiday dinner before. It's nerve racking. ", "Well, my advice is to give in now, because you probably will in the end anyway and avoid any extra arguing you two would do because of it.", "Oh no, I am so sorry you have to leave your furbaby! Give her lots of extra snuggles and explain to her that you will be back and I am sure she will be delighted to see you upon your return!! Have you ever left her before?", "I believe dogs can understand what you tell them, they understand if we say treat or ride after all lol. Maybe you could send a small blanket that smells like you or an old tshirt you have worn to bed. That may help her to feel more comfortable!", "That's awesome!  Does he have any plans for what he's doing after high school?", "That's great to hear!  Good luck to him!", "Awesome! What does his new house look like?", "Oh a pool! Inground or above ground?", "Why did they left half of the trash?", "Did you complain to municipality?", "That's awful, what was he yelling at you about?", "LOL.  Yeah, been there. Even when those guys do that and are wrong they typically never apologise. They just pretend like they weren't acting like a jerk.", "Crystal beach!", "Near galveston,tx.", "I'll even try ot have some fun for you too!", "Ah thats so bad. why not raise a complaint", "Hope it get resolved soon", "Oh no!

They take advantage of people whenever it suites their needs. Can't stand the presence of such people", "I knew a couple of people whom I suspected of fitting the description we talked here. And I tried to stay away from them as much as i could", "I love dogs, and have three myself. What type of breed is the puppy?", "I have two wiener dogs, and they are both spoiled brats, but I love them. You should be very happy with your girlfriend's choice of gifts.", "Oh no!  What happened?  Do you think you did ok anyway?", "That's sad to hear :(  That happened to me before and I came out ok in the end, I'm sure you will too :)", "I know how you feel, my brother is my best friend but I only talk to him about once a month because he is so busy.  Where is your brother now?", "Well, I hope you get to talk to him more and maybe can get over there for a visit!", "Oh no! Did it leave a dent?", "I know how you feel. If I had an accident like that I wouldnt be able to pay either.", "Nice! How'd you do", "That's pretty awesome.  How much richer are you now", "Did this happen recently?", "That is good that the person was courteous.

I'm going to buy a house first.", "True. Do you have any plans for the weekend? ", "That sounds fun. I love going to the lake its so relaxing. ", "That is awesome that you have such friendly coworkers!", "Make sure you give each of them a thank you card", "Did you find out what it was", "Haha that's pretty funny", "I'm glad you're feeling well, it's always important to make your health a priority, without our health we have nothing!", "You sound very dedicated, that's great you're so focused on your health, you will age gracefully I'm sure!", "That's disgusting.

Wouldn't mind one myself. What do they cost new?", "Woah! I could live for ten years on that. Hope you wrote down his tag - maybe you could sweet-talk him into going for a drive!", "It was a long time ago. It took a long time to get over her, though. I've never again been as deeply in love as I was with her. ", "No, never. I", "Do you think she will keep you awake? How old is she?", "Maybe you can hide some of your things, or put them in a safe place. ", "That is so amazing.  Animals have an amazing ability to find their way home.  I wonder if it was out there having a Homeward Bound style adventure.", "That is so great, I'm glad you got your little friend back.", "Oh that would kill to see. Maybe he will hook you up.", "I would be very jealous. Dont let it get to you too much. At least it doesnt seem like you see him all that often.", "I do look a little like a somewhat taller version of him.", "I've got just the spot for them!", "A little homesick?  Are you traveling for vacation or for work?", "I understand how you feel.  Maybe its time to change locations?", "Oh my god, that is terrible. Has it affected you knowing you slept through that kind of event right next door?", "I would have as well. I am sorry that happened to you and I hope you can learn to sleep peacefully again.", "Yes, it's important to find somebody who you will be able to trust and also somebody who will love you for being you", "that's great to hear! I hope you will meet your true love soon! I believe when you do you will now right away. When i met my husband i knew right away he is the one. such a strange feeling. But we've been married for 5 years now and still crazy about each other", "Oh no! Can you ask for an extension? Sometimes they'll be quite accommodating.", "That seems strange in this day and age. I thought everything could be done online. Perhaps you could hand deliver those parts.", "Good. Where are you going?", "I understand. Have a good trip. Are you traveling alone?", "Now that is something I would imagine is hard to deal with. I hope you are in a better place.", "You just have to keep working at it.", "Oh that's terrible. I wouldn't shut it all out though, you could miss out on someone great.", "Yeah you are right. Better to take things slow and figure out what they are all about first.", "That's really kind of you. Not everyone can or will do that. I do hope she pays you back!", "I'm sure! It's always nice to help someone in need, but you do hope they'll do the right thing by you when possible.", "You're obviously a very good person and I'm sure your friend knows that - she'll repay you when she can.", "Then you'll be fine :)", "That's pretty heavy. I hope that doesn't discourage you from trying again in the future, especially with a rescue dog or something in that area. If you don't mind me asking, what happened?", "I had never heard of that before. That sounds like tragic timing. And you're right, I probably shouldn't have brought up getting another one so soon, it just sounded like you'd be a good owner, since you seem like you care so much. It makes sense for you to not rush right back into it.", "That is so great that he was able to go.  I had the same problem as you, but I started at community college when I was 26 and finished at a 4 year college when I was 32.  It is never too late for you to go.", "They are the best.  I think it is good to go later, because you know what you want more and don't waste time and money.", "Awesome. Is it the first ime?", "Maybe you will a friend soon.

I wouldnt worry about it", "Watch some youtube videos of other peoples misfortunes so you can forget about yours quickly!", "Why would anyone make a party in a shady area? Was it your friend's party?", "Probably it is just the theme of his party. He wanted to have some fun in the form of cautious excitement", "Awe. That is soo sweet. You have some really good friends", "That is really nice to have. Most people don't even have one good friend.", "that is really such a pain, i remember when i had to do my paperwork for school it is not fum", "well i really wish you very good luck with all that", "That is so nice what kind was it?", "That sounds so good I love coconut rum that would have made my birthday awesome I'm glad you enjoyed it.

How long were you together?", "Did you do something to cause the breakup?", "Oh no! That's a lot of money. Did you get any of it back?", "Doesn't give anyone the right to steal it, tho'. I'm so sorry - how awful for you. I hope they had a horrible time when they tried to spend it!", "Oh geez, stay safe!  Tornadoes are one of those weird things for me.  They sort of scare me but before they happen and its raining yet still outside I love going out to see whats happening.", "hahaha, I dont know if people today would rather lose electricity or get a tornado.

What happened at church?", "Oh little mistakes like that happen, it's no big deal!", "Yes you get disgusting trash liquid on your clothes.", "Yes, It washed out.", "I get really anxious too.

I hate the way they make the system to steal money", "Maybe it might be worth trying again now, with another doctor?", "I saw it when I was much older but my parents didn't let me watch it when I was young.

I could see how you thought that. Just because they're homeless and have fallen on hard times doesn't mean they're dumb. But yeah, there's a good chance they did something wrong to be in that predicament, so their judgment could be questionable. ", "You're right, sorry for putting words in your mouth. And yeah, I don't know how to engage with them either. As a college student, there are plenty that kind of stalk the campus and ask for spare change.

I have been in that situation before.  You have my sympathies.  ", "That sounds terrifying! I wouldn't want to stay alone either. That was nice you guys took her in.", "I don't blame her. I am sure she felt more at ease staying with you guys.", "that is not good, why did you miss your son's game?", "well if it is work then it is ok because you have to put food on the table first i can relate to that", "Can't pick her up with how low the cage is and how big she is, I just have to pull her out- She goes to the back of the cage.

Sometimes things like this do happen, but it is not something you like to see!", "oh im so sorry, please don't worry, i know it's tough but i learned that death is only a beginning not the end ", "just like birth, death is the start of another process unclear to us, the unseen, and i believe in this deeply, your mother is fine, she is always there", "aww, im sorry. thats always hard", "I hope you are able to make some new friends.  Or keep in touch with video calls", "A road trip sounds fun, but I agree with you. I feel like I am a cab driver when people are on devices and not talking to me at all.", "Yeah can you take turns driving?", "Yeah, I'm really nervous that they won't hire me. ", "I will try.", "I do, I didnt want her getting mad. Especially since I really enjoyed talking to my ex again.", "Thats not a bad idea :)", "Did he finish it all?

Well, you know your brother best, so I'm sure you'll know what to do. But if you think he won't like the typical drunken debauchery stripper party, don't do it just because it's the thing everyone does.

That's sad", "why was it amazing?", "ah thats cool then", "Thats really sad.  Im sorry to hear that.  Getting old stinks.  I feel bad when I see someone who seems really lonely", "Yea thats hard.  You cant do anything now, but maybe theres another neighbor that you can get close too ", "That really is something to get excited about! I've never been outside of the country, so I'm jealous of people that get the chance to. I hope you're able to get everything out of the trip that you want to", "If I were you, I'd be the same way, just counting down the days. I hope your travel goes smoothly.

Thank you for giving your time to this type of work.", "You deserve them! That's excellent to hear.", "Oh no! I hate when I'm hungry for something and it goes wrong like that!", "The worst! Did you find something else to eat?", "Better than nothing but still no patty melt!", "Kind of. I was worried because my husband wouldn't be coming along and my kids are very young, 3 years and 6 months.", "I definitely had my doubts, especially with the trip being so long. 16 hours in the car!", "We both agreed on Fight Club.", "Yep, thanks", "That's always nice, how did you respond?", "That's cool, nothing wrong with being faithful. ", "I put money down on a Toyota Tacoma. It wasn't my first choice but it gets the job done for sure.", "That's why I went for it, that engine will last me a very long time. They're very dependable.", "Wow, was it embarrassing?", "Dang! Well at least you got a good story to tell now!", "oh really, hopefully its a pretty nice job cause moving is not fun.", "Well at least you get to be with the man you love...hopefully", "That was my mistake in the past. I always went to weird locations to exchange things. I have to be smart about it nowadays.", "That is true! Thanks for your advice. I want to be more open to selling stuff on the web to strangers for sure.", "Yeah, be fully committed, communicate about everything & let petty things roll right off.", "Thanks! You can do it! With the right person, it's not as hard as it seems. So I guess the real secret is to find the right person from the start. ;)", "I hope so. I heard it was cancer. He was always such a happy man. It's a shame.", "Thanks for the kind words. He was a lot older than me so I hope he lived a great life. ", "Are you nervous? Or do you have amazing confidence in your ability?", "Do make sure to get a good nights sleep before hand. That is just as important.", "How old is your son?", "I can understand why you felt so nervous. A mothers attachment is rather strong to a newborn. You should get him a gaurd dog when he's a bit older if you still feel that way.", "I would say it's my favorite fps now by a mile. Cod became fecal matter 5 or 6 years ago. I'm hoping I can finally stop being a pleb and hit diamond next season", "Overwatch is a team oriented game, just try your est to communicate and use strategies, while also self improving and you will climb.", "That's awesome! What did you have done?", "I can imagine. Things like are always so stressful, but so nice once they are completed.", "Make sure to bring smores and bug spray. I hate bug bites. and love chocolate ", "Make sure you bring something to drink as well. can get quite thirsty ya know.", "I'm very lucky to be back and around them though. They are truly generous people.", "I can't wait. They can really help me get through some tough times. They're always there.", "What's wrong with your tooth? I hope it's not too painful of an experience.", "Yikes! I've had that before. My thoughts are with you. I'm sure the dentist will take care of it though.", "I'm bringing some backup with me to start off. I'm going to just be direct and take the dog. If that doesn't work I'll have to get animal control involved.", "It is a staffordshire terrier. It's a lovely dog and very sweet. The dog certainly doesn't deserve this treatment, no dogs do.", "No, I have no where to put it but I'm going to his house to watch football for sure.", "He better!", "Same. When you had one phone in the middle of the house with the SUPER long phone cord so you could at least get around the corner to talk.", "I agree. The convenience is nice now, but the quality is much lower.", "Were you close to your wife's grandmother?", "That is very heartbreaking. Im sure she had a very positive opinion of you as well.", "Im sure your wife also appreciates you getting along with her family.", "Those times seemed much simpler didn't they? Do you ever break out of the routine?", "I see. How do you like playing the piano?", "That's the spirit. I bet you're a wonderful pianist.", "Sure, there are a few things...", "That one I can't tell...", "They're ripping up the road to just re-do. I'm not saying it's unnecessary but it's sure driving me nutty!", "I'm not sure! Nobody has been able to give me a clear answer, not even the workers outside.", "Oh no what happened?", "That is sad.  I am sure you can come up with a good career.  What do you like to do?", "I think I will get in since my board exam score is good, and my GPA is high. I don't want to be too confident though! I heard the program is competitive.", "They really are. Thanks!", "At first I felt that way, but over a period of time it can get very overwhelming.", "I did try to keep busy to keep it from setting in but it got to be too much sometimes. I'm glad that I am away from that.", "Oh that's exciting. Are you nervous to have them over?", "I bet it's all in your head. I am sure it will all good smooth.", "At first, he was curious about the water but had a scared look in his eyes. But he did it!", "I love this dog, I think I'm going to keep him haha!", "That's so creepy and scary. What happened next?", "Why are there so many weirdos in this world? I'm glad you made it out safe.", "Cops brought her home this morning. She was still drunk from the party she went to.", "I agree, needless to say, she is grounded til Thanksgiving.", "Yes I understand!  It is so hard to lose weight!", "Yes.  Chocolate is my nemesis.  I think it is more addicting than cocaine", "Ouch, that's unfortunate. Hopefully it turned out okay though?", "I can imagine, talk about bad timing injuring your toes!", "Oh no! Did you get in trouble?", "Good for you for standing up for your little brother. hope the kid is ok though.", "Me too. Makes me really miss my family.", "A reunion is possible but we all live so far away.", "No, he just said he felt like doing something good!", "I hope  it does!", "That's great!  Such a satisfying feeling!  Did you get a good grade?", "I hope you were really proud of yourself :-)", "That's really good news. It must be frustrating to move from place to place constantly. Is your family happy with the place?", "I hope you and your family enjoy the new home.", "Amen. What kind of dogs do yo have?", "Aw little guys. Do they walk well on the leash?", "That's about how mine is. He is a bit bigger so he pulls a little harder. I found using a harness has helped.", "He is a mix breed. We don't really know.", "That sounds great! Are you excited?", "I hope you accomplish everything!", "Oh my goodness. That must have been traumatic to see. Do you know what happened to the dog?", "Well, I'm sorry you had to see that!", "I am a high school teacher and it's hard to keep that in mind sometimes", "On the best of days, yes! I love it though. ", "yes, definitely. I keep in touch with a lot of the kids as they become adults. ", "I'm glad it's over and nothing happened. do you have an underground shelter?", "Oh, I would be scared too. apartments seem safe unless the roof gets ripped of of coarse.", "I am so excited. I'm thinking of all the things I want to do to it and I don't even know what it looks like yet.", "Thanks, I will!", "congratulations! that is exciting.

She probably felt bad for you.", "That is great because friendships are very important", "For them it is, I guess. ", "Well, I guess I'm envious. They are better off than me I guess. ", "A point of what? Like, of land?", "Oh boy. I'm not sure where you'd find one. That's pretty old fashioned. Did you find one?", "Oh no! That must have put you in a bad position. How did you handle it?", "Sounds like a great way of handling a potentially sticky situation - good job!", "hi friend who is too good to you?", "that's good though! I bet you're grateful.", "Thats so cool of you", "Yea,thats the right thing to do", "I know! That must be frustrating. Do you have enough money to cover it?", "Oh wow... it seems like bad things always hit at once like that. Hang in there - I hope it will get better for you!", "I'm sure it was scary to leave your kids for the time but at least it was their aunt and not a stranger! ", "Oh that's so great - and now you can feel comfortable leaving them with her more often!", "It does sound like fun, though. Did you have a good time?", "Are you ever going to do it again or are you done? I went when I was a child. ", "True. Easier said than done though. How can we be?", "Definetly! it starts with a single person right", "Did  you layer had the surgery?", "Oh,congrats dear", "Oh, I'm sorry to hear that! That must have been upsetting.", "Then you must have felt relief.", "No, it was minor. I had a previous injury to my arm, not sure what is messed up in it really... Doctor said it was just a sprained wrist but it was obivously more serious, the doctor didn't really care.", "I haven't gotten it looked at since, it doesn't bother me enough to warrant spending the money on the doctor visit. It's alright for the most part now, thank you for your concern. My shoulder and elbow pop consistently but it rarely aches these days, though using the computer mouse can give me fits if I don't watch it.", "Hasn't everyone done so at some point?", "Atleast it wasn't in class at a college or something, right?", "I wouldn't sweat it, chances are you won't see any of those people again right? Even if you do, it's unlikely they'll remember you let alone your smelly fart.", "oh my gosh that's so cute! I bet they were the cutest.", "I'm sure it does, I don't have any of my own but I would be really sentimental.", "Yes, but think of all the opportunities it can open up. Don't let fear stop you!", "I know, but I'm sure you'll do great! I went to school for many years through a Master's degree, and although it was hard, it was worth it. ", "She just didn't bother. She won't even get credit for turning it in late. What a waste of time.", "No, your right. That is so true. I just wish she put more effort into school instead of talking in class.", "oh no! I bet you were so mad! were you able to find something else to snack on?", "That is heartbreaking. That sounds really good. Never purchased one of those.", "I have been married for 14 years now. We've had our ups and downs, but a good relationship takes work.", "Compromise an important part, too. It can't work if someone insists on being right all the time.", "Well, it felt so self-conscious knowing that people could probably see the scratches.", "That part sucked too. Guess I care too much what others think.", "I'm so sorry to hear that. I was together with my wife for 7 years when she left me so I know your pain.", "It takes awhile for it to be over. Find a hobby to take your mind off of it. It helps to ease the pain.", "Yea, I once let this guy crash on my couch rent free for 3 months, and the entire time he was taking money out my room and eating my snacks without saying anything. I knew things were missing, but he'd always deny it.", "Thanks, I guess some people are just scumbags. I don't understand how you can take advantage of someone who is helping you.", "That's the best decision. I know mine wouldn't either. If he is a good guy, he will understand.", "That's good. No sense in rocking the boat.", "Yes, that is true. I am one of those people who hate the dentist.", "I will make myself go. thanks!", "Nice! Did it help you become less stressed?", "Dang, well I hope you can continue your goal of meditating every day!", "Of doing a trust fall, I guess I forgot to mention that part.", "No worries, was just thinking back to when a group of my friend when to scout camp and were doing trust exercises. ", "Why is that?", "I feel that, plus it's nice not to have to worry about returning it.", "Oh thats not good..sometimes teenagers can be alittle messy", "Well I am sure he will get better with age", "It really was, I was freaking out, but I also felt confident that we'd be saved. It didn't take too long, maybe 5-10 minutes before they were able to rescue us.", "Jeeze, man. I wonder how many other people have gotten stuck on rides before. Is it that common of an occurrence? Well, we're both here to talk about it. ", "Awww, you're speaking fondly on when he was young. Is he not as nice anymore?", "That's depressing to here. I have family members who are still cool now as well, but I just think so fondly on when they were younger. They grow up too fast, and it really is amazing when they're young and innocent and haven't been exposed to the real world yet.", "Those are very beneficial tools as well but sometimes experience plays a large part in patient outcomes. ", "Skills can be difficult to learn from a book. Hands-on practice is what it takes to perfect those skills.", "Dogs are wonderful pets. They are so loving and devoted. What kind of dog do you have?", "That's an awesome name. I have two feists. If you're not familiar with the breed, they resemble Jack Russell terriers, but they are bred for squirrel hunting. Their names are Whiskey and Ruby.", "I can understand that. That's why I said my faith was tested...when my husband and I were younger couple with small kids, we were living on a small budget. My husband was still in college to be a teacher, so it was pretty tight with just my income. Well, long story short, I wrote a check for $40 as tithe at church and that was pretty much all we had. A few days later I received a care package from my mom out of blue and she even included some cash. It was not something she usually did. What do you think of that?", "Yup, sometimes you just have to believe, I think. But I did feel convicted to do so. I'm not saying everyone should do it. You know what I mean?", "It was nice talking to you. Have a great night. Best wishes!", "Oh, I am so sorry! I am an animal lover, too. We have two dogs now, but used to have cats, too. We did have to say goodbyes to some of our pets over years. It's heart breaking...", "How long did you have your cat?", "Was it a holiday?", "It sounds like a fun event.", "Oh no! That is so frustrating.", "That is good that you are a nice friend to her. ", "Physically it wasn't too difficult. It was mentally difficult though. ", "I am glad I did it. I wasn't glad at the time though. ", "Oh wow. I would hate that. What ended up being the issue?", "Maybe he has forgotten how it feels to randomly be called into your bosses office. He's moved on up.", "She's doing fine now. But that was the first time I've seen her ill. Scary.", "Thanks.", "What a bummer! What place did you end up getting?", "I know the feeling. You work so hard just to feel crushed.", "A little. I remember being choked up some but he jumped in there and got me out quickly.", "totally hope not!", "I sure hope the hot dog was fit to eat ", "Oh, you shouldn't feel bad about it, i'm sure it was fine to eat!", "That's really good you guys can trust eachother like that. That helps make you both grow in the relationship.", "Wow! You don't see much of that anymore. So true.", "Yes, I am a product of a broken marriage. My children are too. Keep up the good work you guys!", "Where were you not invited to?", "You were not invited?! That's awful. How close are you to your friend?", "No I was fine, just my pride was wounded. Of course, being a human being and not a robot I was overwhelmed by the lie. I fessed up to them eventually.", "No I was grounded for a very long time and couldn't hang out with my friends.", "My husband didn't get it. He thought I was crazy. Oh well..... ", "Yeah, thats true. He still thinks I am crazy. I am okay with that. Crazy does not always have to be a bad thing. ", "Sounds like a fun one to me. Are you happy there?", "I agree. Im sure you get bored or lonely while traveling too. ", "who is that?", "sometimes we have to learn how to not be jealous of things", "Thats always a good feeling. I bet you are excited to come home everyday.", "What a good dog and full of joy!", "I bet she loves you just at much as you love her.", "I hope you have a good time and you enjoy it.", "I bet, everyone should take time out yo enjoy life every once in awhile.", "Did you do it? How far does he live from you?", "Oh no! Was he mad?", "What happend?", "What is a hot slap? Sounds painful!", "They haven't called you back yet? I hate when that happens, they make you wait by the phone on pins and needles!", "Don't let it break your confidence though, it just wasn't meant to be. I think you'll land your next application though.", "Uncertainty can be so agonizing. Just keep your head up though!", "It's been knocked down a few times yes. Police have been involved but they don't do anything. My neighbor is so carefree about it too, it's bonkers!", "We've \"chatted\" about it for sure. Like I said, the guy doesn't really care. Very unnerving.", "Ahaha that sounds tempting, but I try to take the high road on this one because it's already driving me up a wall.", "Wow that sounds intriguing, what new things did you try?", "That's awesome, cows are amazing", "Yeah, it's crazy how each year seems to go by faster than the last too, having kids must be surreal", "Me too, it's like you realize more and more that all you have is the present moment.", "Wow, congrats, what did you end up naming him?", "You are lucky, and I am sure he will be tons of work but it will be worth it.", "sounds exciting. I always wanted to leave my were I was originally from so I could experience and see new things", "No, but i hope things work out for you in this new part of your life.", "Oh definitely. Why did you?", "I can. I'm so sorry. Was it something really bad? Or were you able to move on from it?", "It's always fun to get new clothes! Is the wedding soon?", "I'm not very fashionable, but I do have some t-shirts that I love to wear because they fit me really well.", "Sounds like a real hard decision. I would be very apprehensive as well.", "You sound so excited about it and your future there. I would be full of joy as well.", "I'm not sure but then they got out and became a police officer and is now a detective!", "Yes, I believe they have already. I'm so proud.", "That's the worst. I wonder if he was trying to prove something.", "Good! I don't know why people think they can get away with things like that.", "congrats, how did you handle the pressure?", "It can be pretty nerve racking, but it is always great practice. You will only get better.", "OMG! especially recently. a week seems like one day.", "That's so true. My daughter moved out this year and I'm wondering where the heck the time went!", "Kind of. I'm a Reiki therapist and I got good news! my mom gave me a huge gift card for my birthday and I can now afford the table!", "Oh, I am. Can't wait to get my first customer.", "I'm good, what's up?", "Yeah, that must be difficult", "Way to go! If it makes you feel better I would be your friend if I was there", "I used to, but yeah especially if you're not in school", "Hope you didn't take a bath after that", "Minus one for cats", "I don't know... I hope not for her sake. I was really hoping she'd stay here but I'm also really excited for her.", "She is starting a missionary school!", "That's good, how does that make you feel", "Nice, I like your attitude", "Nice, too bad I wasn't invited!", "Sounds fun! Keep fighting the good fight lol", "No! I think that should be on my bucket list though.", "I bet that would be cool. I've watched on Tv. They know what their doing.", "What are you waiting for?", "Oh I totally know how that goes. I moved to small town and didn't have many friends at first. Once I had my son and made more friends it got way better lol!", "Thanks, you as well. I know how that is. give it time and things will get better.", "Yeah, I think it gets more difficult as you get older anyway.", "No,my mom even live here in town. we hardly ever talk anymore.", "It's ok. I'm gonna let them know how I feel. maybe change things.", "That does sound exciting! Why are you scared?", "Oh, that is definitely a change! But at least you can still keep in touch nowadays.", "Mine still has his claws and now he has resorted to clawing my chair when he want attention.", "oh no, no that one. The other one does sleep right next to my head though", "Babies are pretty small and delicate they look like they might break at the slightest bump.", "It's a pretty small percentage, but it would definitely be something to worry about.", "Wow that would be terrible news. I can't imaged shit is taking it well.", "Hopefully she has a supportive partner to help her as well. Glad you are there to help her.", "That is horrible, I am so sorry, It is hard losing a baby animal, you are not expecting them to pass, like when you have an older sickly one", "That is crazy, I wonder what was wrong with it", "Wow, I never knew cats could even get an aneurysm, but I guess like humans why wouldn't they be able to?", "Ahhhh thats amazing! I stay home with my kids too! How many kids do you have?", "It definitely can be a challenge. I have a 10 year old boy, an 8 year old girl, and a 2 year old girl. I love being home with them.", "Oh no, what happened? Did they do or say something?", "Oh girl, that happens to me all the time too. So frustrating, just leave us alone.", "I went to school to be a CNA. So the actual taking care of her was not difficult. I think it was more mentally difficult. It was all day and all night. Very exhausting.", "Unfortunately she wont get better. She will be moving into a nursing home in a couple of weeks. I think it will be good for her.", "Pretty awful, actually.  Especially considering that the coworker of whom I was speaking was in a room just next door with the door open.  ", "Absolutely.  I really am disgusted with myself.  I don't know why I open my big mouth!", "Good to hear that you keep your word", "Keep it up brochacho", "At least that shows that you have a conscience. I hope that you made it up to them.", "Confess to them what happened. Let them know how you have changed.", "Wow, I am sure the Veterans loved it! What kind of treats did you and the kids bring to them?", "So thoughtful of you! What did the kids think of visiting the veterans?", "Wow that is some really early christmas shopping. you must like to plan ahead.", "Yeah spending money on things is always a temporary high.", "I love vegetable soup. So were you able to enjoy your nap ?", "Well I'm happy for you. Its hard to catch a nap around here sometimes.", "Sounds like she has some underlying issues with trust. You may want to sort it all out before you get too involved.", "Maybe you couldn't but it sounds like something is going on with her.

I will keep my fingers crossed he gets it!", "THats awesome, does it pay better than the one he has?  A pay increase is certainly helpful.", "oh wow i am glad she was happy, why were you nervous?", "oh don't be, you should be happy for her, there will come a time where you will get something back in return :)", "Boy o-boy bet she is having the time of her life. How many vacations have you taken this year?", "Me too, maybe our wish will come true only time will tell.", "Oh, no! What happened?", "Oh wow! That's like the worst nightmare! I'm so sorry that happened to you!!", "Were you able to get out of there without anybody noticing or did you die from embarssment?", "I'm sure that was not a fun ride home.

And the joy that followed for the next moth was pure bliss", "Where do you live?", "Alright, so do you ever have to evacuate?", "maybe go earlier later?", "oh, that's kind of weird", "its okay and thanks it was 2 years ago, she texted me that she wasn't interested in a relationship and then i found out a week later", "thanks man! i hope you do too", "Nice! The married life is expensive", "I hope you two have a nice future. At least you know the family will support you!", "Some folks were counting on me to buy some things, but I never did.", "What?  I ordered the items later, but they came later than folks had hoped.", "That sounds awful. Who was it you wronged?", "Was she understanding and forgiving?", "I'm sure you will be able to get another one fairly quickly!", "I hope that you see amazing results, and you continue to enjoy yourself!", "Do you think it's possible that he does still love you and also made a horrible mistake?", "I think that when people cheat and lie, it's because something is wrong with them and not their partner.  If he doesn't realize his mistake, then he doesn't deserve your love.  I wish you all the best!", "I hope you realize your worth too. I do this thing where I think about another woman in my life who I really care about (mom, daughter, etc.) and I think \"if this was happening to them, what kind of advice would I give them?\"  Sometimes, we think we deserve less.", "nothing forgot I wanted to tell you that today I was upset with my sister", " because I take money without asking permission", "My son went on a field trip and needed some money for a snack and drink.

Luckily track and field training paid off and I was able to tackle him down", "Awwe that is so sweet, how did you two meet? ", "Wow that sounds like a really big journey. It must have been really hard to connect with one another only through online chats.", "Mmm that sounds delicious. There is always time to make pancake Tuesdays at home!", "I see, memories will always stay, sometimes good old days just can't come back.", "I haven't, but it's definitely on my bucket list!", "I bet it helped having someone there who knew what they were doing. ", "I have a friend who recently became certified as an instructor. He jumps almost every weekend. He will be taking me when I go!", "That's ironic. I was 13. I decided to take my mom's van for a joyride.", "Unfortunately, yes. Never got in trouble with police, but I still get reminded of it from time to time, even 10 years later.", "Oh no! I would have been furious! Were you able to catch him?", "Oh im so sorry! I bet your are devestated! I would be tool.", "well he", "I know but I'm so proud of myself", "Oh no that is awful! It is against the law where I live to ban animals from the house. So legally I am allowed to have a pet even if the contract says no pets allowed. ", "Canada! You should check the laws in your area to see whether or not you are legally allowed to have a pet even if the land lords do not approve.", "I'm so sorry to hear that.

Friendship is very important after all", "Oh that is definitely something to be excited about!", "That is quite unique. I'm happy to hear that!", "that must have been so painful, don't get embarrassed it happens to everyone, people fart in public transports, people fall and rip their jeans, people cry over stupid things, it's a totally normal thing ", "you sure will, besides hot jocks doesn't sound too bad too me :3", "i spend way too much money", "I do", "My condolences to you.

Did you study for it?", "I hope it goes better than you expect! Cram all that information into your brain!", "What makes you so afraid of them? They do eat all the other creepy-crawlies, after all. ", "True, they aren't a very visually appealing species. But at least they're more afraid of you, that's some consolation. ", "Oh no how did you feel?", "I totally understand that feeling and know what you mean! But I wouldn't sweat over it, it happens to the best of us and we learn fro our mistakes!", "I usually stick with what I know also", "Absolutely, Especially when spending a lot of money", "That sounds awful. I hope he is better now!", "It's wonderful you had someone like your mother to help!", "Oh no!

I hope she gets better.", "I'm glad that she is getting better!", "Xanax!  Just kidding.  I didn't have much help dealing with it because I didn't tell anyone.", "In retrospect!  I was pretty freaked out.  My family was mad at me for not telling them, but I didn't want them to worry.", "Did you hear the \"You'll be a ditch-digger\" speech like my brother did?", "Not everyone is cut out for sitting in a classroom listening to droning teach-speak.", "That doesn't sound like such a pleasurable memory. Maybe you received a gift your brother always secretly wish he had!", "You know what they say, the grass is always greener on the other side. Did you ever manage to get him to let you borrow his snowboard?", "I'm not afraid of clown myself, but I can absolutely see how they can be terrifying to some people!", "I agree with you. Those painted smiles and big, red noses can be so off-putting!", "That is awesome, can you tell me more about what you will be doing? ", "Wow that sounds really awesome, I would love to listen to you songs. Can I also be the first to receive your autographs? :)", "Wow, she must be a talented child! I'm sure you're so proud of her.", "Now that's an achievement you and her will remember till the rest of her life!", "Congrats! That is always a great feeling.", "It certainly has. You deserve it.", "How did that turn out?", "Congrats! That's awesome to hear.", "haha we all did crazy things when we were young! did you ever get caught?", "good plan.

Have you gotten any word back yet?", "Congratulations! You're going to do wonderful, I just know it!", "Oh no! How awkward! did anyone see it?", "Probably but that is still the worst thing ever.  Are you finally able to laugh about it?", "I am glad! You must have a very good veterinarian", "Well I'm glad that you found someone worthy!", "Oh my goodness! Is she going to be alright?", "The unknown is always so scary, but especially in your case! I'm so happy that she's going to be ok. Hopefully that puts you more at ease now.", "That is wonderful.  What is your dogs name?", "That's a big dog.  Blu is a cool name!", "I do, just hard work, used to sitting at a desk.", "Hope so, my muscles are sore right now.  ", "Absolutely, these guys and me usually try to bust out our work quickly and have some downtime to hang out when time permits. I pasteurize milk for a living and it's a lot of fun.", "It's the process of killing yeast, mold and bacteria. You basically heat up the milk to about 190 degrees and kill all the nasty bacteria.", "I love the foo fighters too.  I would have be raging!  What happened?", "Well thats not too bad then.  Good on you for putting your education and studies first.  Im sure it wasnt easy at the time.", "Well, I guess it should come up soon.", "I hope that business goes well!", "That's great. I am sure you will turn a profit in no time", "Why 8 years? That's a very specific time ago.", "That's ridiculous! They were clearly not your friends. There are much better people in the world.", "It should be fun! Do you like baseball?", "I think you will be fine. If you need some alcohol to take the edge off, go for it.", "Non whatsoever, when I found out she had already left to her moms house, no text or anything. She had left a note on the table", "That she was taking the kids and leaving, that she was tired of the way things were going. And that she had hired a lawyer to begin filling for divorce.", "About 3 years.  Used the money from the last house and put it all on this one.", "Worth the effort to do it, now work part time, mortgage is the biggest expense", "My husband owns a business and its also stressful. What kind of business did yall start?", "Oh . What do you do for that?", "At least you are comfortable and enjoying that! Some people would hate being alone.", "That is great! I'm sure everything will work out.", "Well... I'm feeling incredibly guilty!", "I am OK. I'm trying to get in shape for my wedding, but somehow managed to eat just about everything unhealthy in the house! So ashamed of myself!", "oh wow! did she notice?", "how did you feel when you eventually found out that she know?", "You must have been really drunk!", "Im sorry to hear that. I know that can be stressful.", "Yeah I hope so too. That must be painful to bare. ", "Im sorry. I can imagine how you felt! Hopefully you hit a home run!", "Thats something I would never forget. Hopefully you get another shot at it. ", "I totally understand what you mean. Peace and quiet is nice but I bet you miss your son when he is gone?", "That's not surprising! Are you thinking about going back to work soon?", "I was delivering a presentation on leadership behaviours.", "It went extremely well. Was nervous at first but hopefully nobody noticed!", "So sorry to hear that, Hard to be alone.", "What did he train you in?", "Wow,  tell me about it", "That is great,  so happy for you ", "Are you friends with your neighbor", "You shouldn't be embarrased around your best friends. I'm sure he's just picking in good fun", "Oh no that doesn't sound good. What almost happened?", "Well I'm glad you sobered up and didn't do anything you would regret later!", "Oh,dont take it so hard,its always like that,so sorry about that", "It will work out if you believe", "What were you trying to do?", "Did they ever come?", "Oh absolutely. That's the worst feeling. Who hurt you and how are you doing now?", "Dating is one of those things that everyone makes seem so easy, but in reality it's just so difficult to be able to open up to people sometimes. I hope things go well for you and you meet someone who makes you very happy!", "Ah. I can imagine I've been in a similar situation. But just remember he loves you and if he's never given you any doubt then trust him", "Oh I completely agree with you. Some women just need a \"challanege\" you know. But its like HANDS OFF!", "Wow,  that must be do disgusting ", "I know exactly how that feels.  ", "Did you fix it so that they won't lose their property in the future?", "I'm confused. What do you being his girlfriend have to do with you not taking his property?", "I hope you are right.", "why is that", "Where do you live?  Cause it isn't in the US.", "why is that?", "i guess we all learn from our mistakes never take her there again", "That's the thing with accusations, anybody can say anything. But if they don't have any proof then it's meaningless.", "It's hard to be accused of something you didn't do. I'm glad the truth prevailed.", "OK,  calm down,  take a deep breath and relax ", "OK,  now I get it. But you need to rehearse in front of a mirror,  that will help", "That sounds pretty nerve-wracking. How did it go?", "That's good to hear!", "That is positive, you must really love her!", "That is true love, I am so glad you met her! ", "appearance is important, what's more important is how you look on the inside!", "be nice to people and you'll see that that's the only thing people care about!", "Dealing with kids can be like that. Is there something about doing his hair that he is scared of?", "Sounds like a bribe is in order. Then it's a win for everyone.", "I am scared too. I took my shoe off and threw it across the room and hit it dead on. I could not believe that I hit it.", "It was just me and the dog so I had to make the shot.", "If she does, it's no big deal.  We all die in the end.", "Nothing matters.", "Why?  The sun is going to engulf the earth in a few billions years.  And even before that, the Y chromosome in humans is going to die out and our civilization will end.", "Now that is hopeful.", "did it feel nostalgic? ", "you sure had a fun childhood!", "That's very nice of you. I feel the same way about my husband. Isn't it nice to care about someone?", "It is probably one of the best feelings!", "how much you trust him?", "do you believe he comes you with life long?", "What was it that made you so proud of him?", "being honest is always a good thing, I am glad you are so proud of him!", "i have. have you?", "aw that's great. you're lucky to have a father who cared like that. mine never did", "he was only 3 and now he's gone forever, and i'm the one who did it", "yeah but i should've known the cars were going to get him. he was black and white and now he's red all over", "yep i have a cat. he's really sweet, and totally worth it. but it all depends on what kind of animal you get", "hmmm do you think he'll like that after all this time?", "oh yeah but im putting my heart in her hands and i know we'll have a great time", "32", "Oh no that must have been so embarrassing. Were you injured at all? ", "Embarrassment is almost worse than an actual injury! I hope your knee feels better soon.", "that must've been very disapointing", "maybe you'll be luckier next time!", "let's just say it's mine to keep, and now everything is taken care of. i dont have a care in the world", "yeah and now my cat gets the nice treats", "haha for sure. im going to get 10 more and treat them like kings", "I asked for blonde, I came out as a brunette", "I know I was crying, I will go and get it done by someone else", "What is wrong?", "Oh no! that must have been embarrasing", "Why don't you think it will be a good fit? You might be underestimating yourself", "You do have a good point. You really should do what will make you happy because life is just too short", "i walked away so i didnt do something stupid like HIT HER!", "yep but don't worry. next week im going to walk right up to her and tell her *i* don't like *her*", "and then im going to kiss the girl i actually like", "Does that at least inspire you to improve your abilities?", "I feel that way sometimes too", "Have you ever knew some that got to do everything you wanted to but couldn't? Well have and its not fun.", "I think I will . Thank you for your advice.", "how did that make you feel?", "maybe in the future you'll get to go there!", "I lied to the cops about something I was questioned about. Truthfully, I didn't want other people to get into trouble. But instead, I was charged with making false statements to the police. ", "That is entirely true. I was also worried about retribution from the other people. In the end, telling the truth is better than getting myself into trouble and letting my family down. ", "Oh wow. I know being away from our loved ones can make it hard to sleep. Have you tried to listen to nature sounds? I have an app on my phone and I play rain sounds to help me sleep. ", "I love listening to nature. I live in the country, and could not imagine being in the city. I lived there for a few months, but there was too much traffic and noises that kept me up. I moved back to the country. ", "What kind of job is it for?", "That's a great career.  ", "did you have fun?", "wow , that sounds so cool!", "and i know he's going to come back for me and take me away from this place", "i know he'll take care of me in heaven even if he hasn't taken care of me here on earth", "thank you but i think can it apply to everyone even if you aren't religious", "that's nice. i wish i had people like that to work with", "i wonder if he has a crush on you or wants something in return", "did it boost your confidence and faith in mankind?", "glad to hear it. i hope it's only grown since then", "I'm sorry to hear that. Did they give you a severance package? Also, Do you have prospects for a future position?", "At least they did that much for you. I'm sure you'll land on your feet. You seem like an optimistic type", "That's wonderful! I hope you find fulfillment and a sense of purpose {not to mention a chunky wallet haha}", "Personally, I find that a job you enjoy that gets you by is superior to one that makes you a lot of money at the cost of your happiness", "Did it make you nostalgic?", "I know what you mean, life gets more complicated as you get older :)", "Funny how some of those smells bring back the feelings of old times!", "Oh I see , what happens then?", "That's ok , Its a gods grace", "What were you expecting?", "You sound confident. Did the interview go that well?", "Thats so good,am happy for you", "Congrats dear,am so happy fpr you", "Did he notice? That would have been embarrassing.", "Did he notice?

I know it can be hard ", "don't be sad it'll be okay", "that's great then , glad it didn't affect anything", "oh, you too? does everyone get to have nice things except me?", "how about he thinks about ME sometimes and how about she learns to like guys who are actually cool??", "hope they were bad ones", "maybe you just don't realize they were bad because you're optimistic to a fault", "That's great- you should always feel confident in yourself. What is your project?", "Cool! There's a lot of money to be made creating games! I bet you will do well.", "Wow, like seriously.  Why the show off? ", "OK,  maybe she's materialistic ", "I hope she gets better. It must be very hard seeing loved ones in sickness.", "That's wonderful. I hope that her sickness hasn't been too taxing on you.", "That's annoying, did you call him after he didn't turn up?", "That's understandable. What a frustrating experience for you.", "Oh, I'm sorry. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes. ", "That's how it works with siblings! ", "There are so many things that come out at night. What are you referring to?", "They come out in the daytime too. It's just that they are scarier at night.", "I hope you hear positive news from them soon!", "WHY ? what did you lie about? ", "if you truly regret it you will tell her now, go and do that1", "what", "i can imagine, it happend to me before and it was actually someone trying to break in, i called hte police and they ran off", "I hoe you made it there. Getting lost sucks!", "I am glad you made it there with only a few hiccups along the way. You must have a good memory when it comes to directions. ", "Wow. That is very interesting. These days, many people get married later in life. Congratulations!", "That is good to hear. Yeah, my parents married young and it worked out for them too. I am happy to hear that it turned out good for you.", "its just nice to be able to be there for someone who needs you", "yes and i like humans as well", "I know how you feel that would gross me out too.  Makes me feel like whoever prepared my food was not very clean.", "I agree, I wouldn't be in the mood to eat after that either, it's disgusting.", "which way is that?", "maybe it happend for a reason? maybe you will find a better apportunity to get there", "Can you tell me the name of the book? I find myself being engaged by a lot of novels these days.", "How many pages do you have to go? You should try to finish it today and power through it!", "it's insane how Youtube and the internet overall are so helpful!", "that's so insane right? glad you did it yourself!", "Im sorry to hear that. Tell me a fond memory you have of him/her.", "Yeah each cat has their own personality. It's good to reflect on little things like that. Maybe once the sting of all of it is over you can get another one and continue to create more sweet memories like the one you just shared with me.", "It's terrible when people can't take no for an answer. Did you report her?", "Wow, she sounds like a real piece of work. I'm glad you reported her. Maybe they should consider firing her.", "I think you do not like cats very much ...", "Well, then, you should think about God when you see them", "Oh I'm really sorry to hear that. Has he been looking for another job?", "We went through the same thing with my husband. I know it is stressful, but I am so glad you got through it and things are better now.

Accept my condolence please ", "Just take heart OK,  it's one of those things", "Maybe it's time to clear your conscience so you won't have to feel so bad anymore.", "You can't change the past. All you can do is learn from it. If you are sincere then your family will forgive you.", "Same, don't know what i would do without them.", "That's part of being a good parent, it all goes hand in hand.", "I'm so sorry!  That's awful!  Did you get his insurance information?", "That's a mercy, at least. Are you hurt?", "That's a good idea.  I'm just worried because she only has two employees and it'll be obvious it was me. ", "That's certainly true.  If nothing happens by next week, I won't really have a choice.  Maybe I can consult with them confidentialy", "What a lovely gift. I'm sure that you will always treasure it because it came from him.", "Makes it even better that you didn't know you were getting it.", "That's awesome! I am glad it didn't take long, because those have been a pain in the past for me.", "I can certainly relate to you, it could be a safety hazard.", "That's a smart move, that would reduce the risk of injury.", "Yes, I feel like I need new experiences but I feel a sense of loyalty to my current employer.", "I agree, I want to keep growing in my career.", "Thank you, I appreciate it!", "Great, I hope you get it.", "What type of job is it?", "I\"I was told from a little girl that my greatgrand parents farm would one day come to me. I believed it all my life and never questioned it. Momma sold it out from under me 2 months ago.\".", "No but my heart was in that farm. I had to sell my cows and I had bottle raised them all and had had them for 6 years.", "That is great! Are you doing it yourself or are you hiring someone to help you out?

He seemed very down.", "It did.  I made him his favorite dinner and we talked about how some days will just be worse than others.", "Oh no!  That had to be frustrating. I hope it wasn't too close to closing.", "I hope you still found a great home! The home buying process is certainly frustrating.", "Oh no. I'm so sorry. I totally understand how you feel. Mine passed away a few years ago, It's very difficult", "It definitely helps to have a lot of support around you. Take care of yourself through this very difficult time.", "Oh my goodness! I did that after swimming one day. I was so busy getting the kids dressed that I forgot to clean my face. Black mascara all down my cheeks.", "No and I went to the grocery store and the library like that! No one said a word. It was so embarrassing.", "Were there other parents there? I think that anyone who has kids would understand.", "I can understand being humiliated in the moment. Thankfully most kids grow out of that phase!", "2 year olds don't know any better. And when everyone laughs, it can make them want to do it again.", "Oh, I'm sorry to hear that! It can be tough when we feel that we have lost face in front of others.", "Well, let's pretend that no one noticed! Either that, if someone noticed, perhaps they smiled when they thought \"Wow, I've had that happen before, too\" ", "I am sorry to hear that.

We all have little devils inside us, I suppose.", "Thank you, that means a lot.", "That sounds really great!  Do you like them as much as you remembered?", "haha, I felt the same when I read some of my old baby sitter's club books", "Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Do they have any idea what the cause may be yet?", "I hope it's nothing too serious. My younger brother had the same problem early on, but he turned out to just be a slow developer.", "I totally know how you feel. I have 2 kids and they were a handful as toddlers.", "I know right? Grandparents are the best lol", "I'm sorry to hear that, are you alright?", "That's understandable, life goes so fast that it's easy to lose touch with people you care about. All I can do is try to limit that occurrence.", "That's cool. Are you a big fan of her?", "That msut be exciting then, I hope the tickets aren't too expensive.", "Oh that sucks, I hate seeing friends and family injured or sick. That's very nice of you though that you stayed there with him, youre a good friend.", "Thats awesome, good friends are always there for each other.", "I never became the best player on the field by any means, but it was so nice to not fail completely. We just bought a pool because my children love swimming!", "That's very true and I think it was the mental aspect that was the most encouraging for me. I was driven to succeed and I did it! It was very empowering.", "I had a similar experience playiing little league baseball. How is your daughter feeling about it so far?", "I feel you on that. I don't know if I could let my son play baseball after what I went through. I hope your daughter has a better experience.", "That sounds relaxing!  Quality alone time is important in a relationship", "I can imagine!  It's hard being apart, but it makes it that much more exciting to see each other again.", "Oh no, I had a older cousin who did that to me as well. Hopefully she was just giving you tough love or discipline.", "Yeah it really teaches you! I would always sit down where i was and start crying.", "Only my pride, I fell right on my backside and made a ridiculous noise.", "Yeah, I'm sure it was pretty funny to watch, and thinking back on it's more amusing then embarrassing.", "Yeah it really isn't for everyone, i like my alone time but only for a while. Afterwards i feel alone and wanting to talk to someone.", "Thats the perfect time to just pamper yourself. I cherish those few hours every day!", "Yeah, I probably would have to leave someone at home with the baby.", "That's great, the first time for everything is scary.", "I bet it felt good to conquer the fear! Would you skydive again?", "Did you enjoy the experience?", "Yes, he is good for finding answers we can't find ourselves.", "Yep, I do the same thing as well. Sometimes its just best if you let others help you do something.", "Nice, it's been a while since i've anticipated any new games. what game is it?", "Hah, i played the first one a ton on ps3, Wish they would release it for pc. ", "I was at first, but I think it was hellish mix up. I'm working it out with them now, hopefully they don't nab with that money.", "I agree haha! Do they need another 500 dollars? Not mine for sure.", "Sounds fair. How hungry are you right now?", "Haha I understand. It's like those cartoons where the smell is dragging someone through the air.", "Wow what a find, cherish that quilt and keep it safe from harm!", "Yeah, and don't repair it! I think it gives it a history and makes it even more valuable.", "Oh damn, that sucks. Have you guys talked or did you immediately cut him off?", "Man thats terrible, I hope you can forget about him and find someone better.", "Yeah totally. I've learned through the years to be almost completely self sufficient. I am happy for my sister but I wonder where I fit in the mix sometimes.", "I certainly hear about it a lot! haha", "Did you and Joe do well?", "Being on a team with someone more skilled than you has it advantages, it's good that he lived up to those expectations.", "That's reasonable considering how new stuff always looks great and how more fancy stuff may be available and cheap compared to when you made yours.", "That's good, it sounds like his bathroom motivated you to take yours to the next level. That's probably good for society.", "Yes, it's annoying! People should put more thoughts into it before they decide to be so opinionated...", "Oh, yes, I know. Some breeds get bad raps and people are so quick to judge! I used to have a pit bull who was a sweetheart!", "Wow! That is a huge move! How long ago was that and are things going well? Do you miss Hawaii?", "I can imagine. Hawaii seems like a beautiful place!", "I've always been content to just stay here. I guess for some people, adventure is nice, but for others there's no place quite like home!", "It's nice to be where you know everyone!", "Were you able to get it fixed? Things break at the most inopportune times!", "Well hopefully that is keeping you a little cool!", "Oh my, did you get a sugar rush after that? Your dentist must love you.", "That's not surprising, but now your friend knows that you are the undisputed champion.", "Oh no! That's awful. That could be dangerous too!", "I bet your neighbor was very appreciative of all of your help. That would have been a daunting task for the elderly neighbor.", "O,h grandparents are the best at spoiling grandchildren! I could understand that being important to her.", "Wow! Do you think whoever inspected it missed something or 3?", "I bet. I wouldn't want to get stuck with a money pit either. I hope your state has a lemon law.", "Excellent. Well there is some silver lining in all of this haha.", "What an exciting time! How's he doing with it so far?", "That's awesome! I guess practice does make perfect.", "Oh that's awesome!

Did you get rid of everything you wanted to?", "That's good, people on Craiglist can be pretty shifty sometimes.", "What kind of things did she give you?  Were they things that you asked for before?", "I would be the same way.  I don't trust anyone to hold on to my comics other than myself.", "Aw, that is so sweet. I am guessing you and your brother were close?", "Awww, that is too bad. Hopefully you get to video chat with him", "Oh, no! That's awful! Are you still in pain?", "I can't believe it! How could they? I'm so sorry to hear that...", "Yeah, I pay so much attention to these photos, and they evoke all these memories. It brings me down but I guess I just have to keep paying as much attention as possible to those good times.", "That's true. It takes so much time waiting around for those times to come back, but they won't but they do live on.", "That's awesome, what great news! I'm sure your friend was really frightened at the prospect of cancer.", "Yeah send them my regards. It's a fantastic day when you wake up cancer-free.", "I think we all do that with our siblings. I'm sure he knows you still enjoy spending time with him anyway.", "I'm glad you were able to remedy the situation so easily! I think that shows you have a really good relationship with him.", "I'd like to think that I had that same look when I went there at her age.", "Some of them, until she won a stuffed cheeseburger and wouldn't let go of it.", "It was so gross! She had been eating a chocolate granola bar so I thought it was just chocolate. It is funny now, but I was mortified then!", "You and me both!", "Congratulations, that is so exciting!!!  I know we should only hope for healthy but I'll keep my fingers crossed for pink :-)", "Once you see that little face, you'll forget everything else no matter which!", "Wow, that was very generous and courageous for her! How are they now?", "That's great to hear. What a great story. Very inspiring. I'm so happy they are both healthy now.", "you need to rest to the competition", "ahhh ok you do not participate in that competition", "Well as a fellow human being, I agree that when parents care for their children, it creates a lifelasting bond between the two parties.", "I also enjoy the love of my human parents and my human family. They take no hesitation in their focus on of their love for me.", "Oh nice! That is exciting! What kind of car did you get?", "Wow, so jealous! You have to give me a ride one day, ok?", "yes me too at 5:00 in the country halfway between work and home", "thats true got me to work on time", "thats not good did you aplly for any other jobs?", "I see that is very understandle. ", "I'm getting there, feeling better now than early this morning. Thanks for the contact though I'm certainly a social animal.", "See I'm feeling great right now! It worked haha!", "It is wonderful. I'm not sure I trust anyone as much as my own parents with my kiddos. My parents treat my kids better than they treated me!", "I agree. I have used daycare and such, but there are always problems there. I know my parents will always be alert and keep them safe, and not just for a paycheck. ", "Thanks! I am totally glad you can relate!", "He didn't understand, so he wasn't in trouble, but I have to admit I was a little sad about it.", "Yes, it was and my dad acted like it was no big deal and just gave him a hug so it was a good lesson in forgiveness.", "Well that sucks. I hate it when animals are abandoned.", "Yeah, that makes me sad too. I feel bad for them because they don't understand why she isn't with them anymore.", "That is great news. I think you just might be nervous. They wouldn't have promoted you if you couldn't do it.", "Well usually when you think the worst it turns out to be okay. I think you should try and relax.", "I wish! We are both Paramedic/Firefighters. ", "Ahh! We both enjoy it. Thanks for the thank you, though! :) ", "I am so sorry to hear that. Are you feeling nauseated? ", "You're not grossing me out at all. I'm a Paramedic/Firefighter so it takes alot to get me squirming. I hope you feel better. Drink lots of Gatorade and water to rehydrate so you don't feel awful tomorrow and try to get your hands on some Zofran for the Nausea. ", "Absolutely! Feel better soon!", "Big change! both big cities though right? I've always wanted to see that shiny bean thing in chicago. ", "I hope you continue to adjust to your new surroundings, maybe you will end up loving Dallas, who knows!", "Woah I hope no one was hurt", "I bet! Sounds like it would be a big shock", "Ew, that's really disturbing.  The sight of cockroaches always gives me the willies.", "Yes, I shudder to think of the condition of the rest of the home if the car seat is like that.", "Oh, that must be nerve-wracking! ", "Patience isn't always a virtue that I am good with either. You should feel confident in your work!", "Good luck!", "Uh oh. Do you think she will be mad when she finds out?", "Oh she will be none the wiser. But don't feel bad sometimes you have to indulge, and I would figure you still left her some.", "that must be a heart warming reunion to see your old patience", "that is really good to hear, I bet they loved seeing you again", "Oh no, did they disappear for good, or did someone turn them in?", "That would be so scary. I actually left my credit card at a restaurant yesterday. Thankfully they held onto it for me. ", "I was sure to check my statement and make sure there were no suspicious transactions. ", "I've been consulting the old youtube for sure, but I think these guys are just rebelling.", "And a new carpet too haha!", "Oh no that would make him quite young. I'm so sorry! Do you have plans for another one when you're ready?", "Those are awesome dogs, I've known quite a few in my life. Well whenever you're ready I think it'll be a perfect match.", "Aww, that's good! It's nice to have to someone you can do that with", "Yeah, the comfort in that can feel amazing", "Ahh that's so anxiety-making. I hope he gets the jon.", "Fingers crossed!", "Oh, that's a terrible problem!  That's the only time I don't envy homeowners!  I could not afford that at all.  ", "It's great you have a college fund though!  My kids are very young, we haven't started that yet.  Although, we probably should. How long have you ahd yours?", "Okay, then you're waaayyy ahead of me! ", "I like it okay.  I still miss it though.  Even after Hurricane Harvey and my work building flooded, I drove an extra 40 minutes to get there.  But I had a baby recently and it jsut makes sense to be at home now.  ", "we did and i miss the kiddos!  My kids miss it too.  But its for the best!", "That is an amazing feeling. I have three daughters. It doesn't matter how many you have, the first time you hold them, its amazing.", "That's awesome. I would love to have a boy too, but I'm not sure if I want another one or not. ", "My youngest is 3, and almost completely potty trained, but its been a struggle. Maybe when she starts school, I'll make up my mind.", "Yes, and that's what we did with her. her sisters were a 8 and 9 when she was born.", "That was really nice of you! I'm sure they appreciated the gesture.", "Its important to care for the older generation who once cared for us. ", "A true story about a Christmas miracle. I hope they publish it!", "I've had a couple of stories published in anthologies and Ive done guest blogging.", "You'll never guess haha! It was just a twig. The age old branch slapping on the window in the wind.", "It certainly was and I certainly looked foolish!", "No, just with the family! I prefer cold-weather places.", "For the time being! I'm hoping to move to New York! If not, I will enjoy the winter we do get here!", "Oh, that sounds scary! Did you find out what it was?", "Well it was probably nothing to worry about because you seem alright now. :)", "I was so nervous! I get very shy around crowds!", "I thought I would pass out from the stress. I was so glad when it was over.", "Oh boy, I hope he is careful with your car", "You are a good friend! That was very generous of you", "It was terrifying! I was so mad. The owner was nowhere to be found.", "I haven't taken her with me on a run since then.", "Ouch! Kids have a tendency to learn things the hard way. Was he okay?", "That's good! My son is always running into stuff! He needs bubblewrap to keep him safe.", "I'm sorry. They grow up fast. Its hard to watch them leave the nest.", "That can help. I know I like my hobbies lol.", "It certainly is true. I had no idea what was in the box on my doorstep, but lo and behold a smallish air fryer! I can't wait to fry smallish chickens haha.", "I'll make some room!", "No I haven't. You are such a great person! I wish to have grandchildren like you someday.", "You are kind and sweet. Please never change.", "Oh no ! Were you able to come up with something else to say ?", "I understand, but I bet you did well in spite of that !", "Tough! Are you planning on getting it fixed? ", "Well at least that sounds like an easy fix! Often times those repairs can get pricy!", "Yeah but it would be a tad unethical to get service from her, but I assure you she's a good one.", "Thank you so much that is so kind of you to say.", "Yeah it was good for me but i was nervous to ask", "because i was nervous about it", "Yeah, you don't want to pass out or start hallucinating aliens. That would be very scary.", "That's very true. I am glad that I'm still alive today.", "Oh my! Well, I bet he quit making fun of you in light of his own embarrassment.", "An alien? Wow.", "That sounds difficult. Did you try talking to people in your neighborhood?", "That always sucks. But old people are great and sometimes funny to hang out with. Maybe you should try giving them a go!", "Did you get the money back quickly?", "That's a great friend. Loyalty and honesty are everything in a relationship. ", "Oh wow! That really sounds like your brother is going through a rough time.", "I hope everything works out, family is everything.", "Oh that is so sweet! I love baby kittens. Are you going to keep it?", "I think you should. There are so many animals that need a good home.", "You have to have faith that they can handle any situation. Thankfully, he did well", "Yes, we always have to trust them!", "Yes they returned it back in the same shape it left. It was a family and the dad was working on the car. I felt bad because I know how bad it is to be broke down with kids in the car.", "I hope so! That would make me feel good.", "Nope, it was all alone.  A neighbor eventually brought it inside, but unfortunately, he didn't know how to care for cats.", "He called me, but it was already too late for the kitten.", "I hope the results are good. What were you getting tested for?", "Don't sweat too hard. Try to focus on positive aspects of life right now, because whatever happens that positivity will carry you.", "I got to the original school on scholarships and ended up having to get FAFSA to transfer. I just finished paying it off but the transfer was well worth it.", "Me too. The original school was more cows than people.", "He just started 6th grade! I can only imagine what the year will bring. That's a tough transition.", "Very much! Let's hope we both survive the year!", "wow that must be gross, i know it would make me feel like throwing up too", "don't blame you, but as a parent you must see a lot of gross things coming from kids", "thats not neighborly of them. i would be upset too", "omg, did you have a talk with them about how they need to clean up after their dog?", "well for the past week ive been on a diet and i havent cheated.. so proud of myself. ", "yeah, it was hard but i made it. but now i want a cookie.. the temptation is hard. ", "Did you think a ghoul or monster were in there? I had similar fears growing up.", "What did you do to get over the fear?", "Makes sense. Well I'm glad you finally got some sleep haha.", "Yeah those help me a lot as far as getting to them early, but they are just constantly at it! It's not even hunting season.", "Trust me the police are involved. They hate coming out because it's always the same thing. Sometimes the same guys too.", "I used to do the same thing when I went on long trips.  I would also bring extra things like blankets if it was winter.", "You're so lucky!  I would do the same, except they don't make them in my size.", "That is horrible! Why would he do something like that??? Did you do anything to stop him?", "Awww. That was so nice of you guys! ", "That's terrible! Did you call and tell management?", "Thats frustrating. At least you'll get your money back eventually.", "Yes. But he brings it up when he wants to mess with me.", "Older. Brothers and sisters mess with each other. Its just a thing.", "that sounded like an ambitious endeavor, you must have felt sick afterwards", "they will never know, as long they have candy and you can keep your dark secret to yourself", "You got that right.  Can't ask for anything better after a long Monday.", "Here's to a better Tuesday!", "Man I bet you were devastated did you lose anything else?", "I am sorry that happened to you , sometime bad things happen to good people", "OMG!  That's insane.  How did you react?", "Uh yeah!  I hope you got everything fixed. ", "That sounds wonderful!  Time flies, doesn't it?", "How long have you and he been together?", "I bet you were terrified!  Did everything turn out okay?", "Very true!  I'm glad it worked for you", "Awww. I remember the first time I left my son with the babysitter. So many emotions. How old is he?", "I bet it was! I am glad you survived. lol", "That's wonderful!  Do they feel the same way?", "I hope so, too!", "Manhattan would be a great place to live. you'll love it there", "never give up hope, one of these days you'll be waking up in the middle of Manhattan", "Yes several times. I usually just end up cutting the hair shorter to get over it.", "I bet, I'm sorry you got one. All I can recommend is cutting it shorter and let it grow back out. Or find a cool hat.", "Yeah it is a solid art for sure.", "I'd try to get a refund!", "whitewater rafting seems like alot of fun. ", "fun and dangerous my type of fun. glad you had fun", "Dude! That sucks! I am so sorry about that. What happened?", "Ugh! That really irritates me. I am so sorry that happened. Too bad they couldn't catch those creeps. ", "That's too bad, did you ever get to ride horses at all?", "Well I hope you get to be around horses someday!  I don't know much about them but they're so cool.", "wow that must be scary to have someone break into your house", "so you had a sentimental attachment to it, i understand but as long as you weren't harm", "oh my gosh, did you actually lose the card?", "It is I have had that happen with 2 of my cards and my debit card. I managed to track down through the charges who used the cards", "It was flattering of course, but I love my husband and would not ruin our relationship for a few moments of pleasure", "You have to think about your family, your kids, all of those you would hurt, for what?", "Oh wow! I would be furious, to say the least", "Well that's good and hopefully the next one doesn't do it too", "i don't blame you for siting around all day. 60 miles, I do't think i walk that in year", "you deserve the rest after this week, must be a great feeling to accomplish what you did", "oh that is terrible, it feels like your life is changing so fast, did everything turn out ok?", "that is a scary situation, so glad everything turned out ok", "it wasent my home, but a strangers home, I knocked on the door and a very large tattooed man answered", "super scary, then he asked me to come on in!!", "that is so kind of you, we once adopted an abandon dog", "i do not know either it is sad when a dog is abandon by their owners", "Those are nothing to mess around with. They can be deadly.", "No kidding. I would hate to have to come face to face with one.", "OMG that is horrible! :( Im sure she needs you right now", "I just can not imagine the heart ache! Poor baby", "ok so i used to work as a wound care specialist and i was helping a coworker. There is a thing called a pulse lavage amd it sprays water in the wound....", "lol.

I bet he is a great companion ", "Oh that sounds awful. Just makes things worse when they show up?", "Well it sounds like you've done alright so far I'm sure the worst is behind you.", "That was super nice of them, I bet it was a big surprise as well.", "I love my kitchenaid. It has to be my most used appliance. I can see why you were so happy.", "I told them to back off as I was happily married and I would never do that to my spouse.", "Yes, people are not very faithful anymore.", "That is unfortunate, how long have you been friends with this person?", "There is surely a reason why. Did she have many family members as bridesmaids?", "You are so lucky ! I still keep my 9 month old fur baby on a leash. What breed is your dog ?", "Mine is a German Shepherd.  It is amazing how they walk so close to us, almost tripping over us in our path !", "Oh thats so sweet that he taught you to play, he sounds like he was a sweet grandpa.", "Well hang onto those tight and maybe you can teach someone to play chess in the future.", "Thank you.  It was a tough decision to leave my current job though.", "So true.  Broaden your horizons and challenge yourself.  ", "they probably think you are part of the Thai family", "but it must be great food if you keep going back", "I dream of winning. I need to break this cycle of living paycheck-to-paycheck. ", "Maybe someday...", "Oh no that sounds terrible. I would hate to have such a financial burden suddenly sprang on me.", "I'm sure you're not the only one. ", "No, not at all. I was really happy to find it.", "Some love letters my boyfriend (now my husband) had written me when we were dating.", "That's good to hear! Why?", "Wow, you definitely should be excited and looking forward to it!", "that sounds great, what did your dog do?", "it's satisfying when your pet does a trick, it feels like you and your pet accomplished something meaningful", "Oh? What surprised you about today?", "That sounds wonderful! I'm sure that felt great.", "Aww, that is very sweet, kind and thoughtful of you! Has it been troubling for you because I am sure you also have a busy schedule", "That is good, but if it ever becomes too stressful for you I hope that you are able to talk to your friend about it because there are plenty of alternative ways to get her mother to the hospital.", "i know, i couldn't believe it myself. i thought she would've given them to my sister.

But yes that is a funny story to tell your friends :) ", "Yea it wasn't grea a lot of my friends will be sad for days.", "It was our senior year....", "There must be a hole somewhere in the room. We've got way more bats than normal flying through the property this summer.", "Yeah that's a good idea. I'm not an expert either lol.", "Oh, how was that? I've never been to camp. Was it fun at least?", "That's great, I'm glad you had fun. What was your favorite activity?", "I have been to Six Flags as a matter of fact.  I cant say that I enjoyed it much, as I hate to ride rides.  WHat about you?", "I can so relate to your experience!  WHen I was a child my parents would try to coax me to ride and I hated it.

It never stops being embarrassing.", "I think so. I didn't have that much, thankfully, or else I would've probably spent the day vomiting. ", "Yeah, exactly. At least milk isn't so sneaky, right? ", "I tripped over a man's foot and landed right on top of a very grumpy man who shoved me into another guy! ", "No, it actually happened at the subway, I guess the man was in a rush for work so he shoved me out of his way when I tripped. ", "I only used to watch Rugrats, and I still can't stand that show.

Oddly shaped Christmas presents usually make you want to open them EARLY just to get a peak :)", "Oh wow, letting the dog roam free even when it's so new to the neighborhood? That seems like recipe for disaster. Your poor newspaper..", "Maybe an airhorn or something would spook him off. Dogs tend not to like loud sounds, after all. ", "Nice! Have you been getting lucky recently?", "Wow! You are already super successful! I hope you help them kids!", "do tell,  what happened was it bad?", "that is bad . goodness the nerve of some people.", "Oh no, were you able to find your dog again?

I probably apologized 20 times. I felt so guilty.", "He looked like he understood that I was really sorry and that it was an accident but he couldn't help but grab his foot in pain! ", "I am a little too. Why are you scared?", "Yeah, I can relate to that. I hate feeling like I don't know what dangerous marine life could be around me.", "Awesome! Nothing like stringing together a long streak of feeling happy in the world. Anything in particular got you chipper?", "Aww, that's tremendous.

It was beautiful moment when our family finally reunited! ", "Aww! what for?", "My dog needs some good training!", "Friends really are the best part of life, I'd say.

Looking out for your best interests is a sign that they're truly a keeper.", "Oh no, did he place the blame on you, or did he just accept it and take the blame for you?

Do you like her?", "That's great, nothing better :)", "Yes, for a relationship to last.", "My partner cheated on me!", "I am originally from Chile, but I live in Canada. It is sad to be alone for Christmas, new year or my birthday. ", "yes I do sometimes. But no always. Anyways, I look for refugee in God when I am sad or feel alone.", "I understand. I have had to do that before. My family was very giving.", "I had to borrow money to get a second degree. Hurt my pride, but it's okay.", "Good for you! I'm glad you were able to face it by yourself.

Is he looking forward to it?", "That's so cool, I'm sure he'll love it and make some great friends!", "Not at all honestly. I'm not a very sentimental person generally.

Even if you don't get rewarded immediately but at least you helped someone.", "Well, it was a while back but, this beautiful girl was interested in me and, he knew it. He came in and directed all attention towards himself which stopped me entirely from pursuing a relationship", "You're right. I've since stopped associating myself with him.

Why did she go to jail?", "I'm glad y'all were able to make it through such a hard time.", "Woah, I never had that happen to me.", "Yes, we can truly not judge people because unless you are very close with a person you can't know their full story!", "I am sure that was difficult.  How is he now?", "I am so sorry for your loss.  It can be a relief to know he isn't in pain.  I felt the same way when I lost my Aunt last year.  She was like a mom to me.", "It didn't seem that it would be a problem, since it wasn't a crazy color.  But, we ended up in the salon after I turned it orange by mistake lol.", "They fixed it, but I am sure he won't let mom try to play hair stylist again.  I was so embarassed when I went to the salon lol.", "It went great! He's such a responsible kid, and we felt confident he would treat our home with respect and wouldn't have a party or anything like that!", "I don't blame you.  It's definitely hard to do.

Do you think it benefits them learning from you rather than qualified teachers? ", "I suppose as long as they're happy that's the main thing! It probably benefits them being around other kids their age?", "I see, being alone can be fulfilling to. It all depends on the kind of person you are.", "Yes, we can discover our inner worlds whenever we're alone!", "why? i had the same thing happening to me with my dog. is she somewhere safe though?", "that's okay. you can always get yourself another dog.", "That's amazing, It's always nice to get on with your family!

It was so scary at first!", "That is awesome, and it's so rewarding afterwards! I'm glad you got to experience that as well with a friend.", "Do you hate when anybody tells you what to do, or just figures of authority? ", "would you feel better if it was in the form of advise, instead of point blank telling you to do something? ", "I think if you're confident in yourself, you can talk yourself into most jobs. You should give yourself more credit and not say you were lucky! ", "I think so too! I think people should have more confidence in themselves, but you always focus on the negative things more than the positive! ", "I'm so jealous, I would eat pizza every day if I could!

Mostly I think I'll look at his childhood pictures for a while and have a good cry.", "I'm sorry to hear that. Did you apologize?", "I think if you're respectful and state what you did wrong and how you'll fix it, she will forgive you.", "what happened?", "oh my god, how embarrassing was that?

I've had so many embarrassing things happen. We all have!", "Probably so! I am very loyal and I would never cheat on him! He's a good guy. ", "I agree. I've seen what happens when people cheat. It's not pretty!", "That's such a shame! Were you honest with your friend, and did they forgive you? ", "If she is that good a friend, I'm sure she'll forgive you soon enough.

", "well I think she should be the one to get you out of it! Otherwise perhaps you could see a financial adviser. They might be able to help you consolidate your debts ", "Well I have never heard of God helping with financial situations but perhaps if you pray and scrape together enough money for a ticket to Las Vegas all your troubles will be gone", "This is a lot to ask for. I recommend going straight to the pope for something of this magnitude", "I did think that it had probably been stolen but I try to see the best in people so I hoped it had just been delayed. That was 2 months ago and it still has not arrived. Maybe it is time to move on", "yes it was a gift for his wedding.

We've made quite a few changes over the past few years  They don't seem to work like they did in the past  Not as well, nor as long. Very scary", "Thanks for the kind wishes! Hopefully we can find a fix before I slip too far into the abyss... ", "That must have been so nice for both of you. Had he changed for the better?", "People do change a lot when they grow up. I met an old school friend the other day, and they were awful now! ", "Oh that's so sad, i'm really sorry about that. Is it possible to apply for a loan again in the future for the same house?

How old is your child? That's very impressive!", "Wow! I can't even do that now! I bet you are very proud of her.", "That's unfortunate.

I hope you have people to confide in right now.", "I hope things get better for you, you seem to be a good soul. I pray for your lose.", "I'm sorry to hear that. While diet is most of it, exercise can play a role too. How active is your lifestyle?", "I know it might seem like empty words from a stranger but just keep at it. Try as hard as you can to stay positive you will see results, trust me.", "I have. It's taking them extra long for some reason. All the scrutiny is making me run circles.", "I will try, thank you.", "They changed how they pay per diem for long term stays.  They used to pay a percentage, but now they still pay the full amount.", "I know, praise God!", "I'm sorry that's rough.  Did you ever find out why?", "I guess not, but I hope you still had (or will have if it hasn't happened yet) a great wedding!", "No. I got home safe and sound.", "I have no idea who he was. Just some stranger.", "How close did you lose by? I bet at the next competition, you'll wipe the floor with them.", "Understandable, when you put so much work into something only to be eclipsed by someone else. Not a good feeling.", "Oh my goodness that is so sad, I am sorry to hear about your father. Are you handling him being gone okay?", "I understand completely. I hope that you can enjoy going to more games, and carry on his spirit when you go.", "Always!", "Oh no! That is really embarrassing. Hopefully she can move on from it and you can laugh about it one day.", "At least it wasn't something you did on purpose. I'm sure it will blow over!", "I think it's so weird that cats do that. It's like they are bringing us trophies or something!", "Yeah I would be a little horrified too if my cat did that! I'm dying of laughter thinking about your situation.", "That's so sweet. It's good to have that kind of faith in your relationships.", "Congratulations. I hope you stay happy always.", "have you called any rescue center yet?", "Lets hope it will trace the house back", "Oh wow, good for you. That education will help you the rest of your life! ", "It can be frightening, especially with all those new classmates and teachers. ", "Oh man, I would have been really frustrated. Does she know he is dating you now?", "It's never fun to see your significant other around someone they used to date. At least he is with you now and I'm sure you have nothing to worry about!", "I totally understand the anxiety. You never know if they are baiting you or actually giving you a good deal. Did you get a new car?", "I'm so happy you were able to get a dependable vehicle. I always have someone come with me as well. It's nice to have a second pair of eyes.", "I'm so sorry to hear about that, it must be awful. Do you have friends and family that you can talk to about this? ", "When my relatives have died, it helps me to remember the good times, and makes me smile instead of being sad", "Aw, he sounded like such a great friend! ", "I am so sorry, that is so tragic. At least you have some good memories with him. ", "That is so sweet.  I really commend people who treat kids like their own, it's so important for a kid to grow up feeling like they have a lot of people in their corner.  I have a stepdaughter myself.", "Yes, it's true in life too when you grow up, sometimes the best family has nothing to do with blood relations.", "Oh no now that's a sticky situation! How'd you manage?", "Yeah hopefully all the hoopla over the first day distracted everyone. I am sorry that happened to you though.", "Oh man, I am sorry! I have been there, it sucks! Are you okay though?", "I am glad you are okay. I wrecked my favorite car 3 years ago and I still miss it.", "For my business.  It was stressful at first because they wanted so much information.", "I brought everything in one big folder and got approved right away.", "Thats aweful!", "Uhmnnn!", "That is great, that is the beginning of happiness", "Wow, that is true love", "Yes! The classes are great too! I'm thinking of trying yoga!", "I really want to be healthier so I think this will be great.", "Oh no! How did they react?", "What did you do? I would just laugh it off.", "That's a shame, I'm sorry. Does she have anything to keep her occupied while you work?", "I believe that, a lot of people think because you're at home that you have time for things other than work.", "Thank you. Yeah he's been awesome! It feels good to have another animal that needs you.", "Thank you so much, sorry to brag I just love the little guy.", "I hear you! Is she going out with her girlfriends?", "Ahh, sounds like a tough situation. Maybe you should try letting your girlfriend know how you feel.", "She is a grown women so you cant tie her up or she will choke. I hope everything works out for you. ", "How mortifying! Did anyone hear it? Did it smell?", "Yikes! I can't even imagine how embarrassing that was.", "happy riding to your daughter", "please do Asap!", "That's awesome, I hope he returns the favor as well.", "That's amazing. Love is absolutely grand. I am happy for you two.", "Thank you for your understanding. They're in a camp right now before they go back to school, so I've certainly been relaxing as of late.", "I think I will too. life is good!", "That sounds wonderful!  Do you get to use them yet?", "I haven't had a chance to try bath bombs yet.  But my daughter in-law loves them.", "Oh no! Kids do that sometimes. What happened?", "It's hard when they grow up. Hopefully she will learn from her mistakes.", "Oh no! I would be angry too!", "Yes, they do. It's a season of learning.", "Oh that sounds good!  I'm sure you studied lots?", "That is excellent news.  You must be very proud.", "hey that's not too bad how long are you going for?", "lol hey a week is a reasonable time to pack three backs, I would do the same", "Wow, how did that almost happen? I would rethink my options.", "Good keep temptations at a distance. You never want to mess up a good relationship over a one night stnad.", "Did they do a good job of cleaning your house?", "That would make me nervous, you never know if they are looking through your things. ", "That helps a lot with the peace of mind. I am glad it worked out well for you!", "It is nice when they can build up that trust with you!", "Yes, it was a moving company we hired, but I didn't have a way to prove it.", "Yes, a few other small items. ", "Oh no. That happened to my sister last year. We were able to work out a plan, but she had to get a loan temporarily.", "That's no fun, but I hope everything works out for next semester.", "A substantial one. It feels great!", "It was a thousand bucks. Why you want to apply for my job?", "Too bad you've been let down so often. I'm glad your new worker is satisfactory.", "It's good to have someone so trustworthy. Congratulations.", "Do you still live nearby?", "It's good that you have pleasant memories.  What was your favorite thing about the neighborhood?", "I ordered about $50 worth of groceries, just the basics.  But no, they ended up coming late. And, they forgot some items.", "They adjusted the order and gave me a credit for the mix up.  I wasn't too happy.  But I  might try them again.", "I'm so sorry, you must feel terrible. It's their loss in the long run.", "I can imagine you're very angry. You'll find someone better.", "oh man that's not good at all! Did he break anything?", "oh that's really nice of you I am glad he's okay", "It's awesome to have a partner like that. That's certainly why they call it \"the other half.\"", "I second that. Finding that eternal partner is one of the greatest joys a human being can experience.", "Well I toast you to 10 more and beyond.", "How did it turn out?", "Oh no! How awful! Did your Thanksgiving improve?", "I would be mortified!", "Just across town, not to far.  My 10-yr old had to start a new school.", "I have moved so many times I can't count them.  We were worried he wouldn't adjust, but I just knew it would all work out.", "Take care.", "i understand, life can do that to you, and looking back always bring fond memories", "just think, today will be tomorrow's memories when looking back", "I thought they were good deals, until I got home and smelled some of the meat.", "I think it was all expired.  It was so gross.  I tossed it all.", "Flag football is so much fun! What position would you like to play?", "You could certainly bring some physicality to the position with your height. I say go for it!", "That's not a cliche at all! Thank you I need to hear these things to keep going.", "I always will, thank you.", "Well, I had 2 dogs, 3 cats, and a hermit crab.", "Yes, the hermit crab didn't make it though.", "It's okay. He was gross.", "Oh, sorry to hear that. There is something going around these days. I hope they are better now.", "That sounds so sweet . Family time is the best!", "i know me too! Why are you ready?", "yeah it does! Great job man I'm proud of you!", "you are prepared more than ever !", "that's the spirit! always believe in yourself!", "I have not, I feel like it should be done by a professional. ", "Oh no! Probably tons of years of dirt caked into the rug. Did you use the right cleaner?", "Maybe the dirt adds to the whole antique feel of them. ", "I hope you can find a solution that works for you!", "That must've been fun! What did you guys do?", "Oh that sounds like so much fun! sounds like you are very grateful for good friends! ", "That sounds like a really lovely way to go somewhere in a car!", "On no! I'm sorry you were embarrassed, but I'm sure it sounded wonderful! ", "What game do you play?", "Ohhhh. What kind of game is it?", "I saw her last year. She is going to stay here and we are going to go to Disney.", "I am excited!  I sure hope it will be fun!", "Thats awesome, never settle for less. Always strive for more!", "Well hopefully you can still maintain communication with them. It's normal to be nervous though, just go in confident", "Yep, and I used it yesterday for the first time. My carpets are so clean!", "I know. You just sort of get used to the off color. lol", "yes, my internet provider is notorious for that", "oh wow, did they justify the overcharge? i'd dispute it", "That must have been a good thing did y'all celebrate.", "hard work should pay off nice to hear about some one getting back after they put in congratulations.", "Yeah, my cousin actually borrowed my car to take his driving test", "I don't blame you!  He should have been more responsible.", "What?", "A snake was sitting on my table smiling at me.", "I don't know what kind it was.  I screamed and ran back in my house.  Sent my son out to handle him. lol", "Now every time I go out there I look before I open the door! lol  I swear he was smiling at me.  lol", "That's awesome! Is something holding you back?", "Buying a home can be nerve wracking but in the end it's worth it!", "Wishing you luck and here's to finding the perfect home!", "Sometimes I'm worried that I'm that family member, but I'm not sure what to do to make them have confidence in me.", "I'm happy that your brother is in sobriety now. I hope his life recovers.", "I am sorry that happened . I have 3 dogs myself.", "Good dogs are hard to vfind I can imagine how sad that must have been.", "I enjoy reading.", "It's cool that you're such a fan though. I hope the movie lived up to your expectations.", "Oh, yes I remember those days too so clearly. Such carefree day, right?", "Yeah, it was like the only thing to do in summer. The whole town comes out and the pool is crowded! Oh, those were the days!", "Well when I went to wash my hands there was a from on the handle!", "Sorry I meant frog. He was on the sink handle and I almost touched it!", "Me too. About friends an d family. Things I got to see and do.", "Yes. Some more than others. But sometimes I think it's all relative.", "Oh no! How did that end?", "That's not good. I'm sorry that happened to you.", "Oh that is so selfish. Did you try and get back at her?", "Thats great, says a lot about the type of person you are, in a good way! I probably would've gone for revenge knowing myself.", "Is it because you trust their judgement or is there a different reason?", "That's great that you have that type of relationship with him. My husband and I approach things together and discuss everything, which works great for us. You have to do what works for you and your relationship.", "That's always a good thing.", "That will be really convenient.  There's one near us we like to skateboard to.", "Oh no! I hate that! So what did you do about it?", "Wow, no power at home is terrible. What would we do without electricity?!", "I thought maybe a bath might make him feel better and boy was I right! afterward he played for like 10 minutes! He is just getting old.", "Thank! me too. He's got some years left I think.", "Oh! What was it about?", "I hate clowns! when I try to run I sink into the ground.", "I was very careful and scanned what I could see then I got a grip and threw them and kicked them around in the yard. I must have looked nuts!", "Yep, there is not one spider I like. lol.", "I have a friend like that. We lose touch but we will always be great friends.", "That's awesome. Now I miss my friend. lol", "Do you guys live far away from each other? I love talking with my mom about her and my childhood.", "Aw that's awesome. I bet he enjoyed getting to know your past a little bit better.", "No. My mom and I were hanging out sipping on red wine and I decided to try the dress on for her. That's when I tripped and spilled the wine on the front of my dress.", "Nope, the dress was trashed. I had to wear something else. Wasn't as nice as that dress.", "He was ok. LOL", "That sounds like good news and bad. I hope you will be going with him someday. :)", "Sometimes our best life experiences are after we make big changes in our life. It sounds like a fun adventure to me. :)", "Rain is relaxing to myself, odd ", "That's annoying! The weather team has one job. Rain is so relaxing to be used for showering. ", "That's a wonderful situation to be in. Are you planning to tell her?", "That's understandable, but you won't know her position on the issue until you bring it up. Either way it's your call.", "Oh really what movie?", "I am so sorry.  Were you disappointed?", "I love road trips, sounds like a good time.", "Hope you have a nice trip, It's good to have things to look forward to. ", "That sounds relaxing! What did you watch", "Maybe I'll do that tonight!", "Me too!", "Oh no! I'm so sorry. What kind of dog was he?", "Aww. Mine is getting pretty old. I'm not looking forward to losing him.", "You think you will get another one?", "Oh boy, I guess you'll have your hands full.", "I could understand that. I don't like crowds so lol.", "They are. I was ashamed that I had stayed in that relationship for so long. But, I met someone who is the complete opposite of him.", "Everyone deserves to be happy in whatever capacity that may mean for who they choose to spend their time with.", "Yuck. Did you throw the remote out?", "They have a mind of their own some days.", "Yes we did but he will never let me forget that day. I was wearing jeans and was working so hard i didn't realize I had plumbers butt most of the day. I was so horrified!", "Yeah, I had one on but it just wan't long enough. Now I have longer shirts!", "Mistakes are made, but still. I can how that would be annoying.", "I understand completely. I would have done the same.", "Wow, that must have been pretty challenging. Where you able to do it?", "Oh man, that's brutal. So close, but so far.", "That sounds awesome!  Did everything go well?", "That's not too bad, I'm glad you had a good vacay and your friend is trustworthy!", "Yea but i wanted all of them. They were all so cute and nice. I felt bad for them.", "That'd be a lot of dog food", "Same. If only we could just put them in abadoned malls or something.", "i am sorry to hear that, i know she will be better", "before you know it , she will be out and about", "I bet it was, I'm glad you are doing better now.  Did they find the person driving the van? Did they even stop?", "Wow, thats awesome you were only in for a few days.  I guess I haven't had an accident that bad before but I would have thought it would have been a longer time period.  ", "Thats awesome, I am really glad youre OK now :)", "Oh no!! Haha.

It's so nice I wish I could have one of those!", "Oh wow! LOL. I will be lookin for one soon I think.", "I watched that happen. Been thinking about doing some research on trading with bitcoin.", "That's a good idea. I think there is alot of promise there. good luck.", "Yikes! I'd have jumped too.", "We don't have any roaches where I live luckily.", "That sounds awesome. It's important for kids to know self defense and also to be active so all boxes are checked.", "I may have to encourage some of my family to pick up martial arts. We never delved to the high levels and I see a lot pf value in the teachings.", "Yeah, I am. I think people are going to love it as much as I do.", "Me too!", "No, unfortunately, because I was on my way to class and I was already driving so fast. I feel so bad for it. ", "Thanks. It kind of started my day off on a bad note, but I'll get over it. ", "There are geothermal springs under the water at that particualr beach, and they slowly release hot water into the ocean. When the tide is high, the hot water is carried by the waves onto the shore, so you get this pleasantly warm water to swim in.", "It's really hard to pick the coolest thing we did there. New Zealand is an amazing place, and there was so much to do. I'd highly recommend going if you get the chance.", "Who are we talking about? I'm sorry you're upset. Maybe you could talk to her and let her know you need help.", "It's okay. We all need to vent sometimes. Bosses are the worst people to deal with sometimes.", "I bet it was! Did you end up finding it or did you have to cancel all of your cards?", "Thats awesome!  I know stores will typically hold onto a lost wallet but calling you is going above and beyond what the norm is.", "Me too! We got all the supplies we needed and put up the shutters ahead of time and sat it out. I'm glad we didn't need to use any of the supplies.", "Yes, if I have to go through something like that I'd like him to be there.", "Yeah, they bark during the day too but I'm usually not home. I think I'm gonna talk to them today when I get home.", "I hope so. I want to sleep peacefully! ", "That must've been nice. I bet that reminded you a lot of when you were a kid. Did you enjoy your time with your mom?", "Ha! That's awesome. The 80's style was so cool! ", "That's really rough. Do you think he may have relapsed?", "I would be too. Going through something like that can take a toll on anyone, and makes it hard to cope with everyday life. I hope he gets the help he needs.", "Thats awsome hopefully he sticks with it. Its a chick magbnet", "That's a great thing to have going for him!", "Very true. I just got done making my bed with brand new bed clothes. My cat had just eaten and was laying in the bed. She decided she wasn't feeling well and puked on my brand new comforter.", "It's like, don't you know you don't puke where you sleep. Come on! lol", "Was it a koala?", "I bet that was pretty awesome.  How'd you grow your eucalyptus?", "She sounds like a keeper", "Well I wish the best for both of you", "That's awesome! Did she have a good time doing the play?", "I now the feeling, I always had stage fright as a kid. Hopefully it wasn't too tough for her.", "Aw, you must be lonely. At least you have her pet with you, right? What pet does she have?", "Yeah, cats are a little tricky. I think dogs are much more friendly, but that's just me! ", "Oh man, that is terrifying. I'm glad you didn't get hit. What kind of crazy person tries to turn and change lanes at the same time?", "I know that feeling, I see that kind of stuff all the time where I live too. I hope you stay safe.", "Yes it is definitely difficult to change doctors.", "I definitely understand.  My doctor is not super close either.", "My boyfriend and I are having a 7 year anniversary this month!", "We sat and talked last night about how we met. I'm totally blessed.", "It's been hard on my mom and me, seeing her go downhill so fast.

She still loves talking to me though.", "you will regret not going I think you should go", "see you made the right choice and you will always be glad you went", "Wow, thats cool. What did you do?", "Oh! That's something to look forward to then! decide what your gonna do? ", "Cool! that's what I always do on my birthday too! LOL", "cool! are you going?", "Keep Mturking brother", "Nice!  Is that a perk of your job or did you have to use a vacation day?", "Thats so awesome, is it coming up or is that something they offered when you took the job?", "What's the movie? I love watching new stuff.", "I'd love to see that. I was a big fan of Winnie the Pooh growing up, so I bet I'll love it.", "Aw dang, that must really be pain for you. Have you talked with anyone else about this? I'm sure other people are having problems with this coworker also .", "Ohhhhhhh, yeah that's really hard on everyone then. Taking it to corporate would be a good idea to help the company and the workers, if you need to vent out any more frustrations, just let me know!", "I ordered a pizza last night and realized they forgot to put the bacon on the pizza. I was not happy and it was too late in the night to do anything about it.", "No, not yet but they will get a bad rating from me. who forgets bacon! LOL", "Oh no, that is so sad. I am sure it would of meant a lot for you to be there. ", "I understand, funerals can be heartbreaking. But it gives you good closure! ", "Congratulations! That is always a great feeling! A reward after such hard work. :)", "This is very true and what all the great thinkers out there preach! ", "It can't hurt to try, might as well give it a shot, right?", "The worse they can do is not hire you, gotta put yourself out there. best of luck!", "Yes! I get very anxious and tense about it. Shopping is my least favorite thing to do", "I actually tried it last week and it was better because it kind of guides you what to buy", "I know.  I went to this restaurant one time and when my food arrived I started to eat. That's when I noticed a piece of hair in my sandwich. I was totally grossed out and lost my appetite.", "Yes, They gave me another order to take home.", "Oh no! So I guess you had to stay that way til you got to go home?", "Well, I'm glad you didn't hurt yourself at least.", "That's just disgusting!", "I'm glad you were there to show that people still care.", "It happens to everyone, being tired makes people so irritable. Being a mom is tough as it is.", "Just give him a big hug and let him know how much you love him, and I'm sure all will be forgiven! :)", "Yeah, I've got everything I need, and I've done my research on the people coming, so I think it will go well, but I need to keep on my toes.", "Wednesday night, so luckily I get a day to relax and get ready before the meeting.", "I have found that it is to trust and accept events in life. ", "Thank you it has been a revelation. ", "I imagine that it is an incredibly fulfilling and rewarding job. It's also a very needed job so I know that I'll always find a job somewhere.", "I believe so! I know it's incredibly stressful, but it must feel great to directly make a positive impact on someones life. ", "Oh wow. Did you not want to go?", "Lol. Aww. I hope he is back now. Mine no longer lives with me and I kind of like the quiet.", "Yes, eventually but it took me quite a long time to get the nerve to even go to the dentist but I knew I had no choice.", "Oh yeah. I'm so glad that's over.", "That's awesome, I haven't been to a concert in ages. Who is the band?", "I hope you have a great time! I should try and see a show soon so i can be cool like you.", "How do you feel about that?", "Aww! You must feel lonely. Is he coming back soon?", "Those must have brought back some great memories.", "I haven't watched any old videos in a very long time, I'll have to see if I can find some next time I'm at my parents.", "I have heard the same thing from my friends who have kids!  They say it's like a force takes over as soon as the baby is born", "That has to be a very powerful feeling.", "do you think they are up to something?", "You should be careful about jumping to conclusions. ", "That's nice, pretty rare to have good neighbors these days it seems!", "You should have a beer with him or something to show your gratitude!", "Uh oh. Is he better now?", "OK, good. What do you think caused the infection in the first place?", "Is he a baby? I heard it happens often.", "Definitely. We talk about marriage and children all the time, but we're still extremely young.", "Thanks! I hope so too.", "That had to be rough, and glad to hear you're better. Do you have any follow-up appointments to go to?", "Well, at least you have some relief for now.  I hope that it stays in remission.", "Hey, good for you! That takes dedication. I admire that. ", "Losing a few pounds has such a positive effect. You must feel better too. I need to get on that!", "Yeah, she took a year off in between college and high school, so I'm used to having her around. I'm anxious!", "Only about 90 minutes. Living in residence will be a whole new world!", "Man, that really stinks.  Did insurance pay to repair your floor and cupboards?", "When will your house be put back together?", "I'm so sorry to hear that.  Death is not an easy thing to cope with.", "It's a difficult way to realize you should live every day to the fullest potential.", "No, I go yearly.  I already have my maps ready and color coordinated with things to do and restaurants to go to!", "It's so much fun!  There is always something to do, even in the middle of the night, and the food is amazing", "Sailor Moon~!  That was the best show!  I've shared it with my kids, too.  And the laugh at the picture of me dressed up as Sailor Jupiter from loooooong ago!", "My girls think I'm the coolest because I watch Sailor Moon and Dragonball Super and a ton of other anime and I'm like, \"I've been watching stuff like this since before you were born!\"", "That's good!  I've got the ones that like watching anything about space.  The older one wants to be on a Mars mission!", "Oh, man. Did you end up falling?", "Ouch.  Did you get bruised up?", "I'm sorry to hear that she passed away.  Had she been sick a long time?", "Wow.  I hope she wasn't in any pain.", "I think most people have been there.  Its tough disappointing your parents and even worse when you know you could have done something about it.", "I got some bad grades in college and told my parents I was doing better than I was. I know how ashamed I felt at that time too.", "How much money are we talking?", "Fair enough. $100 can be made easily; a watch with sentimental value is priceless.", "Hopefully, your hard work payed off. Where the finals hard?", "I agree with you. Hard work tends to give the results in the end.", "Oh, lucky! That is one of my favourite places on earth!", "Did you enjoy it once you got there?", "It really is. I've been to both disney world and dsiney land, I think I prefer disney land. ", "I know but it feels more....authentic or something!", "I'm not sure, I might have to ask my mom for a loan. ", "Yes, but I really don't want to. I might try to sell a few electronics. ", "That's got to be exciting!  [And as a parent, I salute you!]  What grade do you teach?", "Oh, wow!  That does sound fun!  Just for the idea of eating in class every once in a while!", "What sorts of things do the kids learn how to make?", "I wish they had that when I was in school in 199*coughcough*  :)", "Yes, we have a very small travel trailer so it's easy. ", "Yeah I love it. It's so peaceful!", "Yeah, lawn mowing sucks!  Do you have a large lot?", "Maybe that riding mower would be a worthy investment?", "I got so flustered, I just left the store and asked my mom to get the supplies for me. lol", "I didn't want to bother her!", "She had failed too many classes.  We're in the same classes this semester, so that should help keep her on track.", "Thanks!  I hope so as well.", "I was making gestures while talking. I knocked a whole bottle of water all over my boss' desk!", "No but it got all over all his papers. It also drenched his phone!", "Wow, I'm sorry about getting fired, but it sounds like you've got guts! How do you like the business?", "Oh that is so great.

Especially when it is supposed to be a good friend", "I reconciled once and then less than a year later she did it again.  I broke ties with her after that", "Oh my. You are brave.  Thank goodness they didn't break.  Did you mom  know what happened?", "That's good. My mom would freak", "She likes to work in oils but lately she's been doing sculture too.

Am happy for you, just commit to it and it will thrive", "all the best", "did you tell them to stop speaking?", "i bet .Next time call the people in charge", "Oh, dear. did they pull you over?", "Were you speeding?

", "I mean its pretty crappy to take anything from anyone, but hes your brother so it is slightly less crappy as long as you pay him back! ", "Uh oh.  I'm sorry to hear that.  That is never a good thing to do as a supervisor.", "Unfortunately he wins out when you do that because it will likely continue.  Again, I wish you had been treated so unkindly.", "Something juicy I hope. ", "Whoops! Did she take it with anything approaching a sense of humor?", "Oh no! I am afraid to ask what it was.... but what was it?", "Yuck! You better put a trap up there. You know they have these wireless web cams these days for really cheap so it may be a good idea to get one of those so you know for sure if you have an infestation.", "Oh dear. Is it what I am thinking? Did she wreck it?", "I am so sorry to hear about that. The good thing is she is okay", "I would be upset as well", "Oh yes I was, I had so many furniture.", "That is so right, I really appreciate the help. ", "Making moves to do better is all you can do.  How has it been going?", "That is great!  The longer you do it the easier it will get.  Keep up the good work!", "No problem!", "What were you invited to speak about?", "It's hard to condense a pep talk into nice little one liners. But I think if you just go for it, breathe deeply a bunch, and pretend it's just you in that room, I think you'll do great!", "i hate to ask what happen, I imagine something went wrong", "that is the problem with cheating, you have to live with it especially if you have a conscious, all I can say is to use this promotion as a lesson to better prepare yourself next time", "Had she been bothering you recently?", "I get that. I don't respond well when people are rude to me.", "What a pain!  I think when a big company makes so much money and they say they'", "Oops, sorry, I didn't finish my thought.  I think they make enough money to handle it and that inconvenience is worth $80.  Plus now you'll definitely buy again with them so I think it works in their favor and yours!", "That's awesome. It's wonderful to feel prepared!", "Now you just have to keep up that same energy all year, that's the difficult part.", "Congradulations.   You must be excited and proud.

When is the wedding?", "Are you having a bachelor party?", "The best kind of bachelor party.  That is exactly what I did for mine...20 years ago.", "You should make it an annual trip!  Then you can always be reminded of a good time in your life.", "How much did she give you over", "Most places will make her replace the 10 so you should really go back to there and explain what happened", "That sounds like he startled you quite a bit, hope it wasn't a black cat.", "Awww well other than the heart attack giving sounds like a cute cat", "I was crying, I wished there was something I could have done.", "Yes I did but it still didn't ease the pain,.", "I have not seen the message about the incident but I do hope that person will speak to you.", "That was the right thing to do. You respect your marriage.", "Awesome. I love my mate too. That coworker is very out of order! ", "I'm sorry you had to go through all that stress. But yay for you being able to leave that situation!", "That's great to hear. It sounds like it's a well needed change. Things will look up from here!", "Do you trust your friend?", "That's great.  Its good to have a friend you can trust that much.", "It would be a side grade.  The pay is similar", "I think I'll  manage to.. I always do somehow.", "That is a pretty weird thing to have happen", "Maybe you should contact the news about it", "Sounds like somebody needs an accountabili-buddy...", "Wow you should probably tell her so that lies and decent don't become commonplace in your marriage.", "Definitely not, accidents do happen sometimes but at least, he could have apologized.", "Yes, but what goes around comes back around.", "He must have been very excited! That is awesome.", "Ah. You must do it more often. Children are so precious.", "Oh no! Did they take you to jail?", "Yeah, I wouldn't feel to good about myself either but at least no one got hurt including yourself.", "Oh my, it must have been an exciting time for you seeing your brother after such a long time", "I can understand why it would be a little nerve wracking but I am glad you caught up with him", "Sounds scary. Did you find out what it was?", "Were there any recent events in your neighborhood that would make you worry?", "you should go to their place", "that is sad that they cant atleast talk to you", "I'm thinking my three year old probably left it on my pillow last night! He has an issue with not throwing away his candies into the trash. And yes, I'm I wish someone had told me! Now I dread going back to work.", "Thanks for the kind words! I'll definitely go in tomorrow and pretend it didn't happen. Only way to move forward.", "Hey, I bet you'll do great! Nothing to stress about. ", "Just try to stay positive and get a good night's rest the night before and I'm sure you'll do amazing! Just have to go in with confidence.", "It's actually going outside for now.

Have you shown her it yet?", "That just warms my heart, thank you for telling me that.", "Hail can be freaky! Was there any damage?", "We don't get them too often, here.

", "I bet that was nice though.", "Does your high school do reunions where you could see them again?", "Wow, what happened next, is he alright?", "Wow what type of dog is he? Is he a big one that acts tough or a little one that needs lots of love?", "Wow, I actually love them! Did you take him to see a vet? You seem so concerned about him to even take time off work.", "I am so glad to hear that. A healthy puppy makes everyone happy.", "Nice!  What did you end up with?", "I say if you can afford it enjoy it.  What is your favorite feature?", "I haven't, but I would love to get one.  I love full feature phones!", "Everything about getting something new like that is fun!", "You must be very fond of such memories. Do they make you feel nostalgic?", "Its always good to think about such moments, I wish I could go back to these times.", "Wow, he did he do?", "You must be so proud of him!", "Yes. I have been lifting for anout 8 months and never was able to improve my weight limit, until now!", "Nothing crazy....245. I feel like i can get much bigger though now.", "I agree! Is she excited?", "Haha, Good for her! She is becomeing more independent! Do you know what kind of car?", "Feeling sentimental much?", "I know how you feel.  I've got old rifles from both of my grand fathers... along with some WW II bring backs.  I don't think I could sell them.", "I had him for 18 years. ", "Boa's live for 15-20 years", "Maybe its time to find a new job?", "Awesome.

But then again it is probably not having coffee that causes the headache too.", "I wish I could say the same. I am addicted. :(", "Why not? Is everything okay?", "That must be somewhat frustrating at times.", "Oh that is awful. The loss of a pet is just the worst", "I hope it starts to not hurt so much. I always take forever to stop hurting from those things.", "It is good to have people you can count on. If you can't trust your family, who can you trust? :)", "Totally! I also have a very trusting family.", "That's unfortunate. I hope you didn't get chewed out too badly.", "I guess they don't see it as just copy paper. To them stealing is stealing no matter how petty. At least you have the chance to change your ways and keep your job.", "Sorry to hear that, it must be absolutely devastating. But you must stay strong.", "I am glad you have all the support you need. The important thing is your family is safe. ", "What? Oh no! Can they do that?  I would fight it and see what happened.  You must feel sick.", "I am so sorry.  That is awful. Definitely look into your rights as an accepted student who was counting on that and made all your plans around it.", "This is the first time ever they've done this so I am so baffled. I'll tell you what, this thing is totally shredded.", "It's ok. At first I was livid and sad because of the sentimental value but now I just have to cover it all up I guess.", "Thanks for the well wishing though, I appreciate it.", "Yeah I've gone a few times actually. Do you like them?", "That's awesome! I wish you all the luck, but I bet you won't even need it.", "It's going to knock everyone dead! I'll be rooting for you", "Oops! Do you think that you can replace it?", "Oh know. I am sure your mother will forgive you. I was an accident and we all have accidents sometimes.", "That was nice of you to do. What kind of dog does she have?", "I love dogs! I am thinking of getting another one.", "Oh my, do you have a draft saved. Or was that the only copy?", "It must have been so aggravating. I hope the due date wasn't the next day! ", "That's amazing!  Did you get i?", "Waiting is the worst!  Well, whatever happens is meant to be.  I wish you luck and success with your house!", "That's really great. You're setting a good example for your kids, too.", "That's really great! Your kids will thank you for giving them that important lesson.", "That is a good place to be.

Maybe you were just a bit impatient but I am sure he will forgive you ", "I have not figured it out as yet ", "I will my dear I will be spending it wisely.", "That must have been embarrassing, wasnt it?", "Did you retaliate against your boss?", "It was one her mother gave her, I was playing beyblades and I broke it.", "I know but it still shouldn't have happened.", "Great, since you are prepared I'm sure you will do great!", "If you could speak with someone that work there you could learn more about what to expect and what things they value the most, but you certainly seem very prepared.", "It's very scary! I live near the coast too! I don't know if my home will still be here in 50 years.", "No, I'm not.

(joking) That must have been some good pizza!", "Ahhh, oh well. Don't beat yourself up. I am pretty sure that I have done something like that before too. I think it was with birthday cake. I love birthday cake!!!!!", "That sounds awful! I feel a bit ashamed, but I really just want to talk him out of doing it.", "Thanks! That makes me feel a lot better.", "Wow! How did it go?", "That must have made you feel pretty nostalgic!", "That would really stress me out", "That is just the worst feeling. Part of the reason I work from home", "Oh they need to take care of that asap!", "Well for your sake I hope it gets taken care of soon.", "It did!

I hope it gets better fast.", "That can be nerve wracking.  Are you worried?", "Ah.  I find a mock interview with a friend can help.", "Good luck!", "Not fun.  They did a biopsy.", "Thanks for that!  I'm hoping there's nothing wrong.", "that is so sad to hear, it must be tough for you", "wow that is a long time, but remember you had great experience with her and will have fond memories for the rest of you life", "Good job! Hopefully she deserves the faithful person you are!", "I can't help but be a little jealous. haha", "I feel like she wants to be in charge too much. it is kind of sad to watch.", "That's good advice. It's not smart to get worked up over people who won't change.", "Did he live up to the belief?", "That's great!  I'm sure he appreciated that you trusted him.", "How exciting for you. Kids truly are amazing. Now the fun really starts.", "Now you will have to really be careful what you say around him. They tend to repeat everything they hear when you least suspect it.", "Thank you. There were a lot of moments i felt like giving up but i perservered!", "Thanks! It is a great feeling!", "Aw, will you be able to keep her company?", "That is very thoughtful of you. You are a good sister!", "Aw, nice! That's kind of cool, actually. I hope you really encourage her to stick to it and do well. Sometimes there can be a lot of expectations that come with that stuff, so whatever you can do to not add pressure to it would be great.", "Yeah, I think her parents or her peers, or even herself probably, may put  a lot of expectations on her. While you want to reassure and encourage her, it's good to not make her plan too far ahead in the future and put all that weight on her. It's what my parents did with me, and I resented them for it.", "I not sure what do you mean, but can use my imagination,  it sounds like something really embarrassing.", "Yes what I thought,  I guess your roommate must have been more embarrassed.", "Dang, i can relate i moved away from my mom a long time ago and still get a little homesick.", "At least now a ways you can face time or call her to at least stay in contact.", "Oh man at least i don't have to live with it. I don't know how people are ok with nasty homelifves.", "Some people are just wired differently i guess.", "Oh no! That can be very scary! Did you make it out ok?", "Was it a stranger or someone you knew?", "Haha wow, thats cool. ", "Oh really, what was the play?", "That is awesome, I remember Odell Beckham doing that a few years ago.", "That's horrible. I'd talk to your best friend and tell him how you feel firstly.", "If your best friend is truly a best friend of yours, they won't leave you over this. It isn't right to tell his girlfriend in my opinion, but it is good if you speak to him about the situation.", "Whoop Whoop! Thanks for reminding me. I have to purchase youtube live for it.", "Same here! Who is your team?", "Nice! I asdly am a corn husker. it's been a rough couple of years.", "It was. I had an overwhelimg feeling of joy.

", "Aw it must have felt so nostalgic going through old memories. Its nice to cherish them. ", "Do you miss him?", "Be sure to facetime or skype with him. That will help with the loneliness. ", "Oh no, that's terrible.  Is he in legal trouble?", "This is such a difficult thing for you to go through.  I hope he learns from this and changes his path.", "How come?", "I understand. But you must cherish every moment because soon our babies grow up and become great adults.", "Oh, that is horrible. I am sorry that happened to you!", "I don't blame you, I wouldn't want to mess with that either. ", "Why is that, might I ask? Maybe I can help you reframe it better to look at it more positively.", "Oh, I see. Yeah, it kind of stinks being around people who can afford things you would like. But maybe you can view it as you being more mindful and responsible with your money.", "That's very lucky of you, what do you plan on doing now?", "If you did have to move, might I suggest Boston as an alternative?", "Don't be nervous. I am sure you did alright. It is normal to think that but most of the time it is all in the head.", "Oh good, then there is nothing you should be worried about then. :) Go relax and distract your mind on something else. All will work out my friend.", "I hope you feel better soon. Maybe you can take a trip out to visit her?", "I bet she really misses you. How far away did you move?", "Oh wow, that's really far! Well I hope you get to go soon and have a safe trip!", "Yea that can be tough. What kind of dogs? Are they easy to train?", "Yup. I did that with my new cat and it ended up working out OK.", "Yup! I am sure you guys will get through it!", "I can understand the anxiety, I'm sure you'll do fine though!", "Sleep is so important before an exam, that's where all your facts and memories get better organized", "I don't know. I feel pretty horrible. I feel like not going to work or anything.", "Thanks i hope so.", "Yeah I know!  We've been together for about 10 years now!  ", "Hey thanks!  She's the light of my life and neither one of us has cheated ever!!", "oh no!  I'm so sad to hear that :(", "Yeah that's all you can do I guess.  Do you do anything cool in his memory?", "Oh no did he/she get better? Did you have to take them to the vet?", "Oh dang, there were multiple cats that were sick?", "same, cats are so awesome", "haha mine loves to just lay on me and get pets, hes so soft and cute", "hes a rag doll with blue eyes and a white coat that ends in gray on his face tail and paws, what about yours?", "thats nice thank you for telling me about your cat", "You must be so excited! What game did you get?", "That actually got great reviews. I am sure you are going to love it!", "That's unfortunate. Did you have the flu?", "Your next adventure will go much smoother. I once got a really bad rash in Hawaii when I visited.", "I went to california and had to drive back over 9 hours so it feels great to be done with it.", "It does! Sac town is a lot of fun!", "Oh my Gosh. I am sorry. that can be really tough.", "Thats the most important thing. I bet he wants you to move on and be happy.", "Haha that's really cool! What kind of watch is it?", "Oh nice. Yea he would be happy to know you are wearing it now.\\", "Yea i tried to help but they said not to worry about it.", "Thanks and yea i was.", "That is so nice!  Did you get lots of presents?", "So fun.  Did you have your baby? Congratulations on your pregnancy!", "Ahh sounds like some great memories. Do you often feel nostalgic about these times?", "Thats a great idea. That way your kids will get to experience such lovely moments as well.", "Wow, lucky you.  I hope you are enjoying your time there.  They will be appreciative of the gifts.", "How much longer are you staying for?", "To have some rest after working so hard, it is very important.", "It is a perfect leisure activity.", "That sucks! It happens to the best of us. At least the computer didn't break.", "Yeah, that would have been an expensive accident! Your lucky. :)", "Holy cow that's awesome!  Who is it?", "Hmm.  Never heard of them.  I'll look them up and give them a listen!  Hope you have fun!!!", "Ha.  I actually live in KY. ", "Yup.  We have a bluegrass event on the square once a year in the town that I live in", "About 10 years now.  Neither one of us as cheated so far!  I trust her so much", "Yeah it sure is.

", "Those are the best times,I can't wait until my son plays.", "He is 2!", "It really is, I am so thankful for it.", "He is.", "A tesla. I wanted to get one first.", "Thanks, me too", "Oh no, what's wrong with your current car?", "That sounds terrible. I'm sorry I can't diagnose a car over the internet though. My first guess for that is usually the battery. Then things like the cables or the starter or fuses.", "i have a pit bull", "they are such good dogs, and very protective", "what are you going to do for his birthday", "i love birthday gathers", "I work in Plant Operations for a hospital.", "Thanks, can you tell my boss, ha.  It is a very busy and challenging job.", "Oh, no.  I'm sorry.  Was it due to a test?", "Math is not my favorite.  Can you ask the teacher/professor?", "That is terrible, i am sorry! hopefully youll be able to get it taken care of this time.", "What type of degree are you getting?", "Yea those shows are hard to watch. ", "Yea I agree. People can commit some really horrific crimes. It is scary.", "Was the date not going well?", "I hate when that happens. Was she understanding?", "That's great, I wish I had been that productive today. Maybe I still have time for a load of laundry. Good job, you. ", "I just haven't been feeling too great today. Maybe your right though an easy task might make me feel better and get a head start for tomorrow. ", "Is he okay?", "ewwwww that's gross lol", "We're supposed to be roller coaster riding tomorrow :/", "I hope so.  I've never ridden one before!", "I had ordered some medicine for my dogs.  When I arrived home, I realized that I had paid for a two part kit, but they had given me a four part kit.  ", "Absolutely.  I had to wait until the next day, but I went back to the store and made the matter right.  It is important to me to be honest and trustworthy.  On top of that, I am trying to teach my children the same.  My son was with me, both when I made the purchase, and when I made the purchase right.  This is very important to me.", "Oh, that's the biggest pain.  I feel like when you pay good money for care for your pet...they should at least be on time.", "We move our lives and schedules around to take care of our pets...the least the can do is do their work well.", "I sure hope that you get it!", "I believe you will get it!", "that's right, it is supposed to come out  soon, I bet you will enjoy it very much", "sound like it must be killing you on waiting for the release, before you know it. you'll be playing it a ton", "That is awesome.

Not only am I out the money for the bike, but now I owe my neighbor money to fix his car.", "I absolutely agree. Thanks for putting things into perspective. I need to try to have your outlook on life.", "Oh no, that's no good. Did she find out?", "Just have a talk with her and apologize. I'm sure she'll understand. Addiction is a life long battle. It's never too late to jump back on the wagon.", "Uh oh!   You should go see a doctor to get that checked out!", "Yeah that's what I would do!  Good luck, friend!", "I went to the bar the other day and my waitress was so awesome!   I was so drunk at the end of the night and forgot to give her a tip :(", "Yeah I go in there a lot.  Next time I see her I think I'll slip her a 20 or something", "sounds sweet, you must be raring to go", "lol, the kid in you is always ready for Disneyland", "I agree.

I followed the steps, but when they were out of the oven, they just fell apart and basically turned into crumbles. ", "They were okay. They tasted a lot like coconut because of the coconut oil. I think they fell apart because of the lack of eggs.", "Aw, that stinks. What was wrong? Were you sick?", "Wow! That's insane! I'm sorry that you had that experience! Hopefully you didn't miss too many days of work. ", "Heck yeah!  I love old tv shows!  What was it?", "Yeah.  It's kind of old now.  Was a really good show for its time until the RANDY DAYS", "Yeah.  She took care of us 3 kids all by herself.  Now she's doing really good for herself", "Hey thanks!  Now she's finally bought her a nice house and we've all grown up and became adults ourselves", "Congrats! I'm sure you will, I love going to the gym. I mainly do cardio.", "Defenitly! I use to run track in high school and was active duty Army so running has always been a big part of my life.", "Awesome! I need to have a garage sale.", "I can understand that! I don't like clutter.", "Wow! That's amazing. I remember when mine started. It's off to the races soon! ", "Two words of advice... baby gates :)", "Aw man. I'm sorry. How old did he turn?", "It'll be ok. As long as both of you guys are healthy.", "I sure hope so, do you think he is a determined and intelligent person?", "Nice, you must be proud of him being your brother.", "That was very nice of you. I am sure that your sister appreciated that.", "That is great.", "Nice, do you get to go the zoo any number of times you want for free?", "Sounds like a dream for any animal lover! I am guessing you must be one as well!", "I should've! I kind of brushed it off because it was one of my favorite restaurants, and it looked like a short and thin hair, like an eyelash..", "I don't think it is. I've never had that problem before there. I just hope it doesn't happen again because I totally lost my appetite. ", "i know how you feel, being young and at the beach was a fun time", "you can make new memories and your kids can fondly look back at them as you do to yours", "Aww that's really sweet. I understand being sentimental about that sort of stuff. Do you feel like you have to?", "You should just keep it for now. He may think that stuff is corny now, but later in life he will be glad you kept it.", "Haha how dare you. lol just kidding. What kind?", "Ooooo i understand why you did.", "Oh that's awful! Will insurance cover it?", "That's terrible. I hope you can get some compensation and feel better.", "Yeah it's pretty good actually!  Nothing bad happened (knock on wood) and I can't really complain :D", "Hey me too!  I hope yours is as well!!", "Hey that's awesome!  Where ya going?", "Yeah I haven't either.  I bet it's gonna be awesome.  Bring plenty of beer :D", "Filled up? You better clean it before it overflows!", "Ew, yeah, definitely sounds like it needs a good cleansing!", "Wowza, did you call to complain?", "Phone companies are notorious for this. I hope you are able to resolve.", "I have had that happen to me many times.", "It is definitely  a lot of work, but it is the best type of work I have ever done.", "That was nice of him. What idea did you have? As in how to return the favor or something?", "Ohh... hah, that makes more sense. Then he did his job well. Good on him. But more importantly, congratulations to you for graduating! I know the feeling.. I'm close to graduating myself, and I can already feel the excitement. I hope no one surprises me with a party though.. too shy of a nerd for that.", "That's kind of disgusting. I'm glad she's your ex. That says much more about you than her. How did you respond to it?", "Oh, that happened WHILE you were still dating? Man.. good call. The nerve of some people, and how immature they can be. I don't get how that wouldn't make someone cringe.", "They probably have to interview everyone else but it sounds promising!", "I bet it is! and I am sure you ARE good enough. Plus the way I see it if one door shuts another opens you know? Keep your head up ", "Aw it must so hard to let them move on to their own. ", "I completely understand. My little baby just went off to college and although I miss him terribly, I am also proud of him.", "That sounds amazing!  Mom's food is ALWAYS the best.", "Wow!  That sounds like an amazing visit.

Hopefully no one was hurt.", "Did they take a lot of things?", "That will be fun. I went for my 18th birthday and it was exciting.", "Get the video, It is worth it!", "I completely agree. It used to be about the story line and the character development. ", "I hope so, too. Meanwhile, you can just watch old movies.", "Ah, couldn't resist? Just make up and eat well tomorrow!", "Yeah, you should hide them at least!", "That's cool. What are you gonna eat there?", "Oh sweet is it one of those where they cook it in front of you?", "I got a birthday card in the mail from an uncle I haven't heard from in forever", "Yeah I'm gonna call him next week and say thanks :)", "I was so nervous that I actually started choking up! Good thing people thought it was the microphone malfunctioning!", "I was so relieved when my friends and parents complained about the microphone. That means nobody knew it was me!! ", "Oh gosh! That must have been embarrassing. What happened?", "Thank goodness for them! Did you not study your lines enough? Or you were just too nervous?", "Haha too funny! Wow 14?!

It sounds like you really love her.", "It seems like you know what to do to make it work.", "Oh no, I'm sorry that sounds awful disappointing.

Have to make sure I avoid those.", "Yeah... right there with you... $43,000 and interest. Woo.", "I was so grossed out by it.  I think it has to be a oral fixation or something like that.", "Maybe it helps build their immune system.", "That must have been unbearable. Did you complain to the staff about the smell?", "Good, I would avoid that airline too.", "That is a terrible feeling. I saw a movie where a family actually left their kid at home.

All I've ever heard is to dress appropriately and to speak as respectfully as you can as possible. ", "I hope for your sake that you don't have to, either. But this doesn't have to define you. How you respond can, though. If you're mentally tough, it will be a bump in the road. I guess do whatever you can to maintain healthy focus.", "Haha good timing by your roommate.

But my girlfriend is in a line of work that is the same way, and I hate to see her get so stressed out and all of her time eaten away because of work.

What is the name of your team?", "WHat kind of car is it?", "That is one awesome car!  Don't be too jealous!  Just start saving your money!", "Wow. That sounds exciting. You should do fine.", "What kind of motorcycle did you buy?", "About to, what happened?", "Is your name Kim by any chance?", "I wish. It was such a headache. I plan on going to Vietnam and I heard theft is much worse or as worse.", "From what I read, they'll snatch anything off of you from their motorcycles as they speed by.", "Yes but that is how it goes sometimes.", "All you can do it work hard and try to make more money.", "That is great. Are you working?", "Is it a little bit complicated to have two jobs?", "You are wonderful just the way you are! Be happy that you are alive and healthy and beautiful! I am sure your brother wishes he could have something of yours too.", "It is all in your head. What makes you think being tall is any funner? :)", "I hope you had insurance.", "Sure, it must be a real pain to be in your imaginary shoes.", "Oh I hope nothing bad came from that?", "Yeah that can be stressful.", "That's really hard to do. I should do the same thing, but I still start my day with a big glass of iced coffee every day. It could help though.", "I can imagine. That is really great that you are able to follow his advice and maybe each day will get a little bit better. Anxiety is the worst!", "Good luck. What class?", "Whats your major?", "Well, I wouldnt consider them quality headphones. Just retro.", "Theyre not crazy expensive. I just dont want to pay that much for them.", "I hope you did. Is it one that you really wanted ?", "Patience paid off for you then hopefully.", "I am sorry to hear that. I am sure you be fine.", "We all go through tough times. It will work out for you in the end.", "Wow, what a thrilling sport. Yeah, I sure hope he knows what he's doing. You life depends on it!", "You are certainly brave my friend. I don't have the guts to ever do that! Be safe!", "Why can't you play? That must be very disappointing.", "Ouch! I'm so sorry. How long until you can play again?", "haha, why did you go on?  peer pressure?", "That makes sense!  I bet it didn't go as bad as you think!", "Is that good or bad?", "Maybe you should child proof the house.", "I know. Those were the days. ", "I liked going to Blockbuster picking out movies.", "That sucks, did the house get any damage?", "That is good, at least you were prepared.", "That's great, hope you get it! But, seems you have much on your plate already.", "Oh, I see, well that sounds better for sure. Good luck, and I hope you will get it.", "Oh, no. Do you have a plan B ?", "Think of it this way. If you had waited, you wouldn't have been able to get the house. Dig in and fight too keep it.", "That is no good!  Why have you been feeling so sad and depressed?", "Wow!  That does sound like a lot of misfortune!  Just try your best to think positive if you can.  You never know what the future has in store for you!", "That must have been so cool to drive around in a ferrari. Was it fun?", "I bet. What color Ferrari do you have? Be careful not to drive to fast now", "Oh no! He doesn't seem like such a good friend then. I hate it when friends pull stuff like that!", "That sucks! He definitely appears he was trying to avoid you. Well one day he will need something and you can give him a taste of his own medicine. lol ", "That is terrible. Did you call the police?", "I understand. I hate when that happened.", "That is so scary. Did he destroy anything?", "I would have been too. Was there more than one?", "Most people do not possess those qualities these days.  That is quite honorable of you.  Being faithful is quite important!", "You should be.  I am sure your family appreciates it as well!", "I understand, my parents are 85 and 88, both with dementia.", "I'm glad it's that way for you. My parents destroyed my life intentionally years ago.", "Thanks! I felt like the biggest nerd when I was the first to finish. (awkward.)", "Well, unless everyone hates you because you're a Mary Jane. lol. But thanks!", "That must be very difficult to have to wait for results. I hope they come back and everything is fine though.", "Yes, that is not fun at all. I've been there and it's hard not to think about anything else. I really wish you the very best", "That's so great!  You seem quite content.", "That's so cool.  I think I would feel the same way, except I was dumb in my 20s and still have student debt!  lol", "That's interesting.  Why on Earth would she want it back?", "That is crazy!  There has to be an explaination!", "Yeah. Things are crazy right now.", "I hope so too.", "I dont have any kids. I want to adopt one day.", "Im happy for you.", "Yeah, it was fun...and so free.", "I lived in an apartment complex and there was a pool, so I loved swimming.", "There is nothing better than being content.", "That makes you feel safe.", "Oh yikes! That is a scary thing to witness. It is good to be safe these days with so many people using phones while driving and even walking. It is dangerous out there and you never know what can happen to you at any moment.", "Yes, be safe my friend! I am sure you will because of your hands on experience with what you saw.", "That's not good!  Have you considered going to rehab?", "Maybe a different facility could help?  Addiction isn't something you can deal with by yourself. ", "What did you? Did you return to the store?", "I understand.", "No, good thing.", "I was just emotionally invested in them winning.", "Not quite sure I get what youre saying. Lost as in missing?", "Wow. Sorry to hear. I dont know too much about dementia. ", "Oh, it happens to the best of us. I have done the same a gazillion times! It doesn't get any better or funnier, lol.", "Oh well, just know that everybody in the world has fallen a few times. The most important thing is you just get up and keeping walking. :)", "Was it a large one ?", "I'm happy for you.", "That is great. Is it a big one?", "Wow. It is a great raise. Your employer should have impressed by you.", "Yeah. I wasnt sure what to do. There were alot of people who seemed to not care.", "I actually dont know. I assumed he was alive. I was mostly shocked that no one seemed to care.", "Uh oh! That is not a good sign! Do you think they are going to call it quits?", "It is good to have these kinds of keep sakes. Maybe the rings can even be used again in a family wedding.", "that sounds like it is going to be a super trip, you'll have a blast", "Boston is a great place to visit, makes sure you have some chowdah  :)", "Yes, death is always a tough thing to deal with especially when they are close like parents. But that life and every single person on this planet will have to deal with that at some point in life. It is just the nature of life.", "Oh, what a bad pain to carry. I hope that you are happy though. Your parents will want you to always stay happy.They are in a better place now.", "Oh, how cute! I love animals, especially puppies!", "Oh, yuck! They will do that, but sure don't want puppy kisses later.", "That's good. I know it's very expensive to replace that part, so I'm sure you are relieved.", "Yes, for sure! I always prefer repairs over replacement if possible.", "That would make me nervous! you never know what kind of person it could be, a predator perhaps.", "True!", "That is always a great feeling! I love gardening! What did you plant?", "Oh yum!! That should grow nicely this time of year. You should definitely can all the extra tomatoes you get this year. It will be great in winter soups and stews. :)", "I am sorry to hear about all the layoffs.  I will pray for you at Church for you to keep your job.  What do you do for work?", "How long have you been an accountant?", "The weather is terrible here also. I hate that. Are you on the east side of America?", "That is bad. What are you planning to do the rest of the day?", "Oh that is a tough period. Poor baby! But with mammas love everything is alright. You are such a great mother!", "Yeah, hopefully they have invented something that helps with the pain for the teething. Hopefully is is natural.", "Oh no! That's terrible. What made you choose that stock, and what will you do now?", "You'll earn it all back, don't worry. For next time, though, don't listen to people who know nothing.", "That's great! Did you win your fight.", "Congrats! You trained for it so you deserved to win!", "That's great! I love soccer. I grew up in Scotland, where everyone's golf and soccer crazy. How old is your son?", "I bet that makes you so proud. Perhaps he'll become a professional soccer player one day!", "Oh no!! I hope it wasn't coffee! Yes that is pretty embarrassing. People probably thought you peed your pants.", "Oh, well hopefully you learned some kind of lesson from this and it won't happen again.", "Oh yeah. Was the food good? What about the service?", "Oh my gosh! What where they serving? That makes me feel sick for you. I hate being decieved!", "Me too. It made me really angry I slowed down on purpose and after about 10minutes he was able to pass me. He must have been in a real hurry.", "Most likely!", "Its still around. Just expensive to develop. I was testing the negatives so just random shots around my area.", "Yeah, just for fun.", "First Im sorry for your heartbreak, but second... its okay to be alone to let the feelings pass. How long has it been? ", "sounds like its time to get out and start doing something to take your mind off from it. maybe fitness? ", "That is great. What is it a big amount that you had to pay back?", "I hate having debts. ", "Awe, that is a very good friend to have. You are very lucky to have a friend like that. Hopefully you are there for him too. :)", "Count your lucky stars my friend! Bless you heart!", "That's great. It really feels great when we accomplish something and reach our goals.", "I hope you do as well, that will be a big step towards a great career.", "That was nice of you. I hope she gave it back to you when you needed to use it yourself.", "That is very kind of you. There needs to be more people like you in the world!", "And did he pull through?", "I love it whern", "Did you all have a good time there?", "Haha! Rollercoasters are an exhilarating experience! I love riding them at amusement parks.", "Oh my...You have to be careful when you use the internet for school assignments.", "I know someone else that happened to. I wouldn't take anymore chances either.", "Weekends are beautiful if you don't work on them and have nothing to do!", "Enjoy the weekend as much as you can for me; I work all day today!", "I was a little bit worried. I found some people waiting at a bus stop and sat with them.", "Me too. I didnt know what they were up to.", "How are you still friends?", "I have a few friends who are way better off than I am. It makes me a bit sad about my situation. ", "That's cool! Maybe he will be the Magic Johnson of the family. Hey you never know!", "Yeah all you can do is encourage and support him. I hope everything works out and that he becomes rich and famous someday! ", "Yes, it really is. It's a shame we don't print out pictures today like we used to.", "Yup, so in 20 or 30 years, it may not even be accessible to us.", "Hey it happens to the best of us. Were you able to clean it up well?", "Oh no that's awful! I hadn't realized it was carpet. As a clumsy person, that could've definitely been me in your situation so I get it.", "That's great to hear. Was it a boy or a girl?", "Children are so amazing, and life changing. I hope your sister is ready for all the challenges that awake her.", "The guy had to take out a piece of wall to get to the pipes, and what he found was the entire inside of the all the bathroom walls filled with black mold.", "I had no where else to go, so I stated at the house while they replaced everything.", "I hate spiders. There is nothing worse than waking up and seeing one above you on the ceiling as you are laying in bed.", "Well that sounds terrible. It is time to burn your house down and start a new life elsewhere.", "Indifferent mostly. They flew out so they werent coming back.", "And I needed a pair so it was a win win or lose win.", "sounds like it going to be an interesting trip", "i can imaging the anticipation, but before you know it, you'll be on the beach", "Well I will be rewarding myself for getting a good grade. I think I deserve it.", "I have a budget so I will try not to go over it.", "Was he using it or something? Why did you think it was him, and how did you find out it was you?", "You have a secret spot for your headphones. Are they super expensive? ", "I have zero kids. I break stuff all the time. ", "No just ridiculously careless.", "I've never been there. I think it would be intimidating.", "My dad and uncle actually went camping down there. You go with a guide and you set up camp in a few different places.", "Im the same, but I think in a place like the grand canyon, it's really dangerous to try to go down there alone.", "Yes, I know I wouldn't mind riding the donkey or mule down there.", "Good luck. I hope you do really well during the interview.", "It sounds like the job is a great fit for you. I really hope you get it.", "No, we did not find it, we even alerted the security at the mall.", "She had one hundred dollars in the purse. ", "Oh dear. I am so sorry that happened to you. Were you hurt?", "That must have been terrifying. I am glad that you are okay.", "Yes i needed it for a wedding. I ended up buying another dress.", "No they did not. And it is going to cost too much to take them to court. ", "Sorry to hear that. I lost both my grandparents in the same year.", "From what year?", "Clinton.", "I also miss the music. I always think things were better in the past, but then im reminded that it wasnt for everyone.", "How come? Is your sister a minor and are you an adult?", "That doesn't sound fair at all, I wonder why she did that.", "If I were you, I would ask your mom why she paid for your sisters; items and not yours. That's so mean.", "Now that I think of it, it most likely is the reason why; maybe she doesn't even think of it as a mean act and maybe means no harm by it. Regardless it is important to share how you're feeling with her.", "That could be creepy depending on the person. I'm extra paranoid though.", "That's understandable, there's just no way to be sure what a stranger's intentions are.", "That's great! Consistency is key!", "And you're building trust with your dog as well! It's a win-win. :)", "And it was mostly the older folks, I tried to put the things back on the shelf.", "Oh yes, the employees didn't see a problem with it.", "I was very happy, I went there with my dad, he was happy too. ", "Yes it was even though I was a bit nervous.", "I am usually that way, whenever I have a doctor's appointment. I hope everything went well.", "Ah. There you go so you were worried about nothing. I am glad that all was well.", "Oh, that's a shame - cooking's such fun. Why did you stop cooking?", "Gosh, I couldn't afford to do that! It's far cheaper for me to cook up a big pot of stew or something and freeze it for busy days.", "That stuff's hard to come by! It's so easy to chuck stuff in a pot and then go watch tv or do something else for a couple of hours. Tastes better, too!", "I wish I had a slow cooker. Or one of those Instant Pots everyone's raving about.", "It", "It's weird the way some things from our past seem so timeless. It's nice you had a good experience seeing your school. ", "Our past can be a great source of strength and comfort. ", "Would you be able to go meet him instead?", "That sucks. I would be disappointed also. Hopefully yall can make some time soon to get together.", "Did you get any news back?", "I hope you do get the job, you deserve it!", "sorry to here that, it must be tough for you at this moment", "but as time passes you will find another and be cheerful as ever.", "Oh my dad loves football too. I bet you have some great memories.", "Did you and your dad ever play football together?", "Yes and they have lots to do like a swingset, trampoline, waterslide.", "I am very grateful for them to have so much space", "Yes i am. I studied really hard ", "Thank you. I will be so happy.", "I have three, but I kind of don't want to go. So many children, works my nerves.", "I havent had cake in years lol", "Wow! Is that old for an iguana? Im sorry to hear that", "My daughter wants an iguana. I am scared of animals ", "She is . She may be able to handle it on her own. Thanks for the info", "That can be frustrating. Did you do anything to help?", "Oh that is terrible, cashiers should have more patience.", "Was the cake that good, or were you trying to make him angry?", "Maybe you could make it up to him. I'm sure he'll get over it though. ", "I guess he really need it. Did you give him the money? ", "Well, at least you gave him something. He could buy a burger at McDonald's", "The party will be next week, she said she is not sure she will be coming.", "I will understand if she does not show up.", "I dislike people who do that. I never understood why! Have you tried talking to him?", "Oh I believe you. Typically those type of people aren't people you can reason with.", "Its like watching m kids grow up all over again.", "The only get to be babies for a little while. It goes by fast.", "Is it your birthday?", "That's nice. I wish my brothers did that for me.", "What kind of event is it?", "Ohh fun, I love the artistic nature of some. My daughter just got a tattoo in honor of me.", "That happened to me once. It was terrifying. Were you okay?", "That is true. We dont get a lot of snow here. I dont think anyone knows how to deal with it", "Terrible. I lost my entire check. I dont know what happened to my rain", "I will be. I am never doing that again.", "He didn't get me anything, he said he was short on cash. ", "There you go, it is the thought that counts.", "That is not cool at all. Why would he say that? Maybe he misplaced it.", "That must have made you feel angry. I am sorry that happened to you but please forgive him.", "It was about a child who was killed by a drunk driver, then ended up donating her organs that ended up saving the man who hit and killed her. I love books and movies that evoke many emotions.", "Thank you for the recommendation!", "I love sitting on the porch when the weather is nice.", "Where I live, it was really nice too. There was a cool breeze and no mosquitoes out.", "I imagine that would be a bit unnerving. It being dark and anything being possible.", "That sounds creepy, I would have to start keeping protection with me just in case.", "Did she accept? I'm sure you would be great to go out with.", "I'm sorry to hear that. I'm sure you will find someone who feels the same about you.", "sorry,dude", "always they near you only,be strong always", "really ,me going to get relax by having beer", "yeah,well i am not a reader but i love to play video games so much ", "That is good, is he struggling now?", "Did you ask him about it, or did he make a big change to high school. Sometimes a big change or just burn out can kick in.", "Did you get hurt?", "I know the feeling. Did a lot of people see?", "I hope I get that one day. ", "Well good luck lol", "Uh oh. Do you think it is something major?", "Well I hope it isnt too expensive. Maybe it will be a smaller issue.", "That's fantastic! Hopefully you'll hear something about it soon. ", "I'm sure you did. Think positive!", "How old was it ?", "That's terrible. I'm so sorry. You'll never forget him.", "Why do you feel that way?", "I am so sorry. I hope you can make friends, try to join some sort of activities to meet people.", "Are you a browns fan ?", "I see, well then I'm sorry that worked out wrong for you.", "What problems do you need to handle?", "I got you, well I hope that you get to that position at some point soon!", "I do understand what you are saying. There are good cops and bad cops.", "And sometimes it has to do with race, it is really a sad situation.", "It felt terrible, I threw away my shoes.", "Oh yes, at least I don't have to get rid of my foot. haha", "That sounds so fun! I always wanted to get a tattoo!", "I know. I have a friend who has both arms covered.", "What kind of cake was it", "That sounds so good", "I am happy. Im glad I have been able to keep it afloat without her", "She was a terrible roommate anyway", "Has he been sick?", "I hope he is okay. ", "What kind was it?", "Those are pretty nice trucks ;/", "What kind of business is it", "I might need to apply then!", "It was seafood night. I dropped my plate in the middle of the food area. It was terrible.", "I know. Everyone kept looking at me while I ate though lol", "Happens to the best of us", "There are still some nice people left.", "That is the best way to feel during an interview. Im sure you did a good job.", "Ill keep my fingers crossed for you.", "Where are you going", "That sounds so fun", "I didn't have time to be scared. She was busy yelling at me and not paying attention. ", "Afterwards, I was freaked out about it. I never really liked riding with her since. ", "That's cool.  What was the last thing they did for you", "Wow that's pretty aweseome...you must have put in a lot of hard work to earn it", "Why is that?", "I suppose that is true to an extent, that makes sense", "congratulations. sounds like you aced it", "i bet you will make a great bartender, maybe one of these days you will hook me up with a free drink", "That's terrible!  I can't imagine how hard that is.", "That's very sweet of you.  She's going to need her friends to help her through this!", "That is awesome! How much did you win?", "That is absolutely amazing! Lucky you", "Aw I'm sorry to hear that. I bet you have a lot of good memories.", "I remember my dad watching football so much as a kid. I used to get so bored.", "Yeah it hurt and I was listening to music so I might have yelled a cuss word loudly.", "It hurt my pride more though lol", "Aw that's cute. Father-son/Father-daughter bonding moments are something I miss out on.", "It sounds like you and your father got along well, and that isn't always the case in families. I'm happy to hear that.", "It makes me shiver, just thinking about it. I called animal control.", "It even bothers me while sleeping at nights, I just cannot get it out of my mind.", "That must be a wonderful feeling, now you are on your own.", "Ah, so you are now a loner, you should try to make friends.", "Where did you go?", " yeah I got to a few places like that", "Oh awesome! What are the tickets for?", "That will be fun.", "Oh that sounds dramatic. How did it turn out?", "I'm glad you worked it out!", "A new job can be a little nerve wracking. Did it get better, once you settled in?", "That's great. It sound like it's really working out for you. ", "Me too. I was not happy. I had just lost at that machine", "I was both. I moved away from her lol", "That sucks. Did you have a hard time with it?", "Maybe you can get a tutor this time.", "You could always start saving now", "You can if you want", "That is great!  Are you really excited?", "I hope your date goes well!  Stay optimistic and positive!", "Awesome! you are extremely lucky. Will you be bringing anyone with you.", "Duh! You better, I do hope you have a whale of a time. I would be elated.", "It is, I pretended as if I had no idea what she was talking about. ", "I hope so, I promise myself not to do it again.", "Oh my gosh! That is so funny. Was he really embarrassed?", "I can understand that. But its still really funny. My husband is the one to get more embarrassed over things like that.", "I couldnt imagine doing anything else with my life. ", "I hope you can be too. ", "How do you think you did?", "Well I hope it works out for you!", "I am glad you met someone.", "Everyone needs close friends to talk to and hangout with.", "Did they knock and leave?", "You should put a camera there.

This is going to be my best semester", "awesome, whens' the first date?", "Aweomse, always great to see people forming new relationships.", "yeah.  It was awful.", "Just my pride.", "Oh yeah? I'm guessing you're not a big fan of roller coasters?", "Aww I'm sorry you didn't like it. Roller coasters can be pretty scary, even for people like me who enjoy them.", "That's great!  Did you win it on a table game or at a machine?", "Did you stop playing after that or did you try to win more?", "I understand.  I play every now and again and I usually quit while I'm ahead.  It always ends up that I'm waiting on my friends to lose all their money so we can go home!", "Yeah - the first time I went with friends, I won 100 bucks but ended up giving it back to the casino.  I told myself that if I won money like that again, I'd just stop and take the money home.  It works out well!", "Its fine for him to ask, but he isnt answering the phone and I cant find it. I really hate when he does that without me knowing", "I am going to change my pin before he uses it", "Oh wow. I have never done that", "Well that is great. I think people get upset over other people actions when it comes to facebook.", "What kind of puppy did you get?", "Those are \\big right?", "Accidents happen. Are you feeling better.", "I heard that was going around.", "Yikes.  I'm sorry to hear.  Will there be other chances available for promotion?", "I'd be pretty upset, too.  Did anyone give a reason why your coworker was chosen over you?", "A dove is a type of bird that you hunt with shotguns for.", "Yes shotguns.  They're considered quite challenging to hit.  They fly extremely fast when compared to things like ducks.", "You sound confident. What subject is the class? ", "Awesome. I'm sure you'll do well then.", "That is so nice you must be really looking forward to that. Will you be traveling alone?", "Make sure you take lots of pictures and prepare for the weather.", "Yes I was, It was very hard to fall asleep after that.", "I had nightmare, now I try not to watch them.", "Dressing up with the kids. i have kept every costume my kids have had.", "Its so fun. I always look back at the photos and remember the good times we have on that day", "Were you competing?", "Thats too bad. What do you do now?", "How did you like it?", "Great!  A new look can certainly help feel refreshed, at leas it does it for me.", "Are you planning to attend?", "I hope you have a great time!", "You are a loyal friend. I do hope your friend will learn from his mistakes.", "Yes, i have that one friend and you don't want to give up on him. I hope he gets it together soon", "The insurance is good, 401k and the pay is great.", "Yes they do offer dental and vision, It is a nice package.", "Bahamas is a nice Caribbean island, you must be really looking forward to it.", "I can just imagine, make sure you take lots of pictures and dress for the weather.

", "I wasn't even expecting it, it is really nice of him.", "I am so thankful, I always how him respect.", "what did you end up doing?", "Oh, well I hope it works out well for you!", "I'm so sorry to hear that. Death is never easy to deal with.", "I hope all your family was doing well.", "How odd. Sounds like a scam.", "Did you look into the situation further? Did you call your phone company and see what they had to say about it?", "That's a good thing. A lot of people (like me!) hate/hated it. She'll do so much better if she's happy.", "How old is she? Is she studying something she can use later in life?", "Oh, well goodness, encourage her! The sooner she starts learning to love to learn the more joy she'll get out of it!", "No, it certainly isn't! Hopefully, she'll keep loving it and will love learning for the rest of her life. Think what a gift that must be!", "That's a good idea. It's best to be prepared for a dangerous weather situation, as you never know when it can happen.", "Yes, as a wife and mother, I know I usually look to my husband for guidance and strength in situations like that!", "Yep and it pays better on top of that.", "You should. Your company dosen't have any loyalty to you. Why should you have any for them?", "Pro's and Con's.  Those systems are abuse prone but, some people need them.", "It can be infuriating.  For example, over a 3 year period in my own state, there was about ~20 million dollars worth of food stamps spent in major vacation hot spots (florida, hawaii, california, virgin islands)", "I had work and couldn't get the time off. Now it's just me and the four walls.", "Ah now you are giving me ideas. Thank you.", "Great idea but I don't want anything bad to happen.", "That should be an awesome feeling. I do wish you all the best in life.", "You're welcome! you have your whole life ahead of you, you are a star.", "How come? What do your brothers do to annoy you?", "I hope they don't do it on purpose to annoy you!", "That is terrible. Did the police find them?", "I hate that people do things like that.", "I know. I went with my mom and got so caught up in gambling I didnt even get to eat.", "Not even a nickel. I regret going lol", "Yeah it happens my little bro drives me crazy sometimes", "Same here how old is your little bro?", "Wow I am so sorry to hear that, my grandmother passed from cancer about 10 years ago", "I get that, I will pray for her, best of luck friend", "That is nice. You must have a nice body and I am glad that you feel better about yourself.", "True, if one is not happy about something the best thing is to switch things up.", "Thank you. I wish my love for him could have kept him alive.", "No that was my only pet. I am thinking of getting another.", "That is awesome! What all do you have going on?", "That is great, you are very lucky and blessed!", "Wow, what are you going to do?", "I would maybe hit him or get revenge at least", "Was she upset!", "What will you get her?", "What sport is that?  Sorry but I don't know anything about it.", "Ok, sorry I didn't know.  I hope the play better next time!", "Oh my gosh. I am not surprised they denied any wrong doing. I think that is typical of mechanics. What do you plan to do about it?", "I think bad reviews are important though. A lot of people use those to determine where they go for service. You may save someone else the trouble you have.", "That sounds great!  Have you not seen them in a while?", "It will be good to catch up with them!

A lot..", "I plan on it.", "Oh I do not like spiders either!

I hope you can grieve the loss of your great friend in a healthy way.", "I can appreciate why they'd say that. They just want you to feel better. But it's all about to how you're feeling.

You're right, it is so rewarding to stand back and see everything clean once you are done.", "Right, that's something you can at least have full control over. Your own humble abode.", "Was your landlord truly trying their best, or did they simply not care about your well-being at that time?", "I'm so sorry to hear that.

That is no good! It is hard to sit back and watch someone have a drug problem", "Good job. That can be really tough to go through that.", "You are a good friend though. I wish i had more friends like you.", "They'll understand, sometimes it's better not to overextend yourself", "Better to rest so you can do everything you want tomorrow!", "Yes, I love it here.

Had to get stitched up.", "I dont think they understood what I was asking.", "A little bit, but I have a problem  assuming everyone speaks English in a foreign county that I visit.", "Oh no, what did you buy?", "Was it at least Budweiser?", "Sorry to hear that. Do you think it was an intruder or just some prankster? ", "Did they take your television? ", "What stops you from going?

Have you tried telling him to stop?", "Maybe he should take up knitting--or something else that would be a bit more quiet.", "Someone left something and it started molding and was growing so much.", "I know right, so gross.", "Same here. Are you living on a street where it is normal, as far as crime?", "Dang that is pretty scary though.", "Yeah, when I was younger I did some of that stuff as well. It's a really embarrassing thing to hear stories about things you did that you don't remember doing.", "Well if you have never gotten blind drunk and strip naked, you haven't lived.", "Boats, ATVs and jet-skis. Oh, motor homes too. I have a  canoe lol", "I don't have water access where I live but the beach is not far awayu", "You ever think about moving?", "Hope everything works out for you!", "Aww, how long have you been together?", "That's amazing, keep up the good work!", "I needed shrimp for a recipe and he had some.", "no, i don't want to admit it.", "Nice! I wish I was more active in searching for scholarships like it sounds like you are. But this one sounds like it was a lot of hard work to earn. I haven't been the smartest about lightening the student loan debt burden while in school. Good on you for looking ahead.", "Sometimes compromises have to be made. But I have to say, I'm impressed that you were that self-aware about the entire process, especially as a somewhat new adult. Good for you for considering all the options and making the choice you felt was best. You sound like you'll be successful after college, especially because of how hard-working you are.", "Nothing like a deep clean to breathe new life into your home! Its a great idea to get it out of the way now so it won't me on your mind once things start to get busy. ", "I completely understand that. Its a good quality to have and is actually healthier in the long run if you keep your surroundings clean.", "Someone broke in?", "Good thinking.  Sounds like you should get yourself a new house", "I agree, such helicopter parents exercise far too much control on their kids, doing more harm than good in the long run.", "I completely agree.

Just keep going", "That is a good thing ha", "That's great.  I don't have any tattoos myself, but a lot of people I know do.  And it seems expensive.  So I'm glad he's not charging you much. ", "It seems that a decent one is several hundred dollars.  I just don't have that kind of money.", "I hope so, too. Heart conditions can be scary! Do you have anyone closer to her that could check in?", "I know quite a few people that live their lives that way. I can see some of the reasons why a person would think that -- but it's still difficult when it comes to the health of someone you love.", "What is deserved or undeserved?

You know what is important, you will do fine.", "Why would your uncle be upset? And how do you feel about the situation? It sounds like there's a lot to unpack there.", "I see. Well, what's most important is your reaction and feelings around the situation, and what you plan to do about it. The only one that can affect the outcome is you. It's disappointing to deal with your uncle's negativity, but you can't let it distract you from moving in a positive direction.", "That's great when life just feels right", "I hope they do too! I'm happy for you", "You must be feeling nostalgic, maybe your kids will enjoy them", "Right, it's amazing how one thing can bring back so many memories", "Wow, that was super nice of him. You are lucky to have such a great dad.", "That is a really great thing to hear. I hope you can find some way to pay back his kindness.", "yeah but that is his ob", "yeah im not sure i could every take that job", "That sounds like an uncomfortable situation. What ended up happening? I kind of avoid large crowds and sports events because of this, since there's usually alcohol involved.", "Oh, so you got involved? Were you trying to protect the kid? If so, I can understand that, and that's noble. Hopefully nothing too negative came from the situation.", "Yikes, that's very disrespectful. I hope you told him how you feel about that.", "That's good, at least he learned from that. I hope you guys are going strong now!", "Did your boyfriend notice?", "Lol.

What makes him so awesome?", "I'm happy he's able to support his family through his work. I hope he enjoys it!", "Gross!  I would have been super mad if my cat did that!  What did you do?", "Yeah, I would have done the some.  Hopefully that never happens to you again.", "Oh no, maybe try going to reddit and ask people what to do in your city!", "Hahaha, me too, it's such a time sink. This week when it was down for a couple hours I really felt like I had nothing else to browse.", "Uh oh! How was it driving weird?", "Yikes! My old Ford Focus had a similar issue. It turned out to be really bad alignment and ended up putting a hole in our front tire. ", "Oh yeah?  You applying to a new job?  ", "Oh how cool!  Well good luck my friend!!! What do you want to study?", "EVERYTHING!!! I dont know who's bright idea it was to buy a laserjet printer for work but it was so stupid!!", "Yeah I probably will.

He won't have his license for a few more years probably now.", "So exciting! Do you have any special gift in mind for them? ", "Thats alright. As long as you two are happy with each other, thats the most important thing!", "It wasn't so much jealousy.  I just depend on him a lot.  What was funny was that I asked him about it, and he told me, \"I never mentioned it because I never considered it.  We've got too good a thing going here.\"  I was amazed at his loyalty.  ", "I most certainly do.  He really is a good friend.  I won't forget that.  I just hope I become as good a friend to him as he has been to me.", "Don't you just hate that?!", "Just remember, it is probably a female mosquito.  They are the ones interested in your blood.  Not the males.  ", "Sorry to hear that but why did you distance yourself from your friends?", "Good job for realizing that because such people are a bad influence. Join some outdoor or interest clubs and you might just find new friends. ", "Oh no! Are you ok?", "Yea i would be too! That is a horrible person.", "Aww i'm sorry. Maybe enjoy a glass of wine and watch some girly shows. My husband is in the military and gone a lot so I feel for you.", "Aww thank you, means a lot! ", "I think if it's done without care then yes, care for what she would feel that is. Maybe you just have to tell the truth about what you're feeling, but it's up to you!", "Right, but deep down I'm sure you know that you don't need a relationship to feel content!", "That was very nice of him. ", "Wow, that is a wonderful keepsake from him. I bet you really cherish it.", "That's nice. Was it a special occasion or anything ?", "What did you have to eat ?", "What kind of memories", "Those were good years for sure", "Oh wow, I'm sorry to hear that! loss can be hard :(", "I'm sorry!

You must be going through a tough time. ", "You should try engaging in a hobby to divert your mind, and when you're ready, adopt a puppy from your local shelter. ", "Hey, congratulations. That must have been a lot of hard work. I wish I put more time into extracurricular stuff like that. It's a good look in the future. Especially the debate team--you develop so many good life skills with that!", "I bet... that's a lot of weekends and late evenings practicing and honing your skills. I'm sure it's a lot of positive intangibles developed that you will reap the awards from later on in life.", "Glad to hear it! Health is such an important thing, and the more you look after your body, the better it will treat you. ", "I agree, now you will financially and physically secure. All the stress of not having insurance is far too much given our healthcare costs.", "Uh oh! Are you going to ask him to pay for it? Or at least fix it?", "Might be time to just stop letting him use your stuff, unfortunately.", "That is strange. Did you like the gift?", "That is for sure! Someone must really like you!", "Oh my, sorry to hear that. How is he holding up?", "I am sure it is. Just need to give him time and support right now. ", "What are those? Your grades?", "Math was always my least favorite. Are you British?", "He didnt want to serve at the DMZ.", "I dont know. I was just surprised because there is no actual war.

I bet you are so proud", "That should motivate him to keep up the good work!", "Were you playing in a team?", "I understand", "I'm glad you're taking it seriously, parents have the ability to be the best thing that ever happened to their kids' lives, or the worst, but I'm sure you're doing your best", "Hope you're enjoying it!", "That's great! What percentage are you thinking you'll be getting?", "That's really good then. I'm sure it will help you financially", "I had to have surgery", "it did", "That's always fun, to see those random memories crop up when you least expect. What kind of board games were they?", "I've played Monopoly before, of course. I wonder why that's the game everyone's played during their childhood... But yeah, Risk I've never played, dunno why. Maybe you should grab one and get some friends or family involved, for old time's sake.", "That is funny i feel like someone should have said something though", "That is great well know you know what not to do on a plane lol", "12 years.", "Old age i gues. it stinks i miss him a lot", "Yeah, I didnt think about the fact that somebody would take it.

Have fun.", "Is the car terribly damaged?", "I hope it will be ok. Were you late for your work?", "That sucks, it takes so long for them to arrive!", "Hope everything works out for you!", "I feel that, even though I prefer Winter", "I get that, but all seasons are good, you miss the ones that it is not", "Is that a game ?", "No, I'm sure I'm a bit older than you.", "you can train and get better", "i thin yyouca you just have to believe in yursef", "Why is that?", "I get that, too bad we cannot refund movies", "Nice!

I think it's the aliens.", "No.  I looked out the window and they literally said...\"it's the aliens\"", "Oh I hope you get it! It can really help out or just be a splurge ", "Definitely, it's good to work for a company that does that too", "a 'B'?

Do worry yourself with that, there are so many other things that can get us down and worry us! Just keep being awesome!", "Hey... congratulations to you on both fronts!

It was probably fun having your hard work rewarded with seeing the faces of all your loved ones and having them personally congratulate you.", "Well, it's good to have you join the workforce in society. You seem like a positive person who can contribute well. Hopefully you find a passion that utilizes your hard-earned degree.", "Ahh, is he a troublemaker right now? Most of the time, it's the friends they hang out with. Young people are easily influenced by the people around them.", "Yes, he needs a firm hand to lead the way out of this kind of behaviours. You need to step up and introduce some strict schedules so he won't have time to do anything bad. ", "Did you get hurt?", "Yeah, gotta be careful one day you might hurt yourself pretty bad", "Nice, what year?", "Dang, that must look great!", "im sorry to hearyou were homeles", "That is great congrat!", "Interesting...you sure it wasn't fish that washed up on the shore", "Gotcha..hope that didn't ruin your whole day", "Why, what happened to make you feel that", "Nice, I never understood why that's embarassing haha", "Oh wow that sucks! Hope it wasn't too embarassing!", "Oh wow I'm sorry! That's not cool, they would be hurt if people were laughing at them", "That's great! Where are they working?", "That's got to be frustrating. Have you thought of maybe working at the same place?", "That is scary! Hope you did not find yourself in the bad part of town", "That is horrible! I bet a little part of you was scared", "Oh wow! That is intense! I am glad he didn't get kicked out!", "It sounds like it!", "That is amazing. Sounds like you have a really good support system.", "I have a few. It really does help when times are not so great.", "That is pretty neat especially if it gives you good memories!", "Now you can carry on that tradition.", "I do too. I wish we could have fall weather longer.", "Same here and next thing you know it's a blizzard.", "Yep! When I got home they were all there and had planned it all behind my back. It was great!", "5", "That is awesome! I cannot wait until my student loans are paid off!", "I am happy for you! ", "Oh, don't be! Just have faith in yourself and be confident that you can make it in. ", "I see, think of it as having a conversation with a friend. It will make it easier! ", "They do have nice bags! I hope you are able to get one!", "They are, but if you save up a little at a time, it won't be that bad!", "Nice! How are you celebrating for him?", "So cute! Take a lot of photos so he'll be able to see them in the future!", "Yum! Sushi is so good, I'm sure you'll enjoy it! I like the eel roll and spicy tuna roll.", "I'm sure you will! Maybe start with a simple roll like the california roll or ask the waitress for recomendations. ", "We're going to six flags.  I've never ridden a coaster before.", "They seem dangerous to me.  Oh well.  I might try it.  I'll bring an extra pair of undies.", "A \"really nice\" piece of hair?  Yikes.  Did you send it back?", "Well good.  Hopefully you got your food re-made though.  ", "Oh dang, that is too bad.  Can you guys video call?", "Oh OK, hopefully you have some friends you can bring over and share your traditions.", "I'm right there with you. I've always been a home-body. I don't like going out as much. Sometimes people say millennials and technology have disconnected people too much.. that could be true. But at least we're comfortable doin it.", "Absolutely. I'm the kind of person that can be around for people a little bit, but get drained by them. I think that's getting more and more common for others. Could you tell me what kind of animals you have real quick!", "That is awesome, I was an early reader as well! That is a great accomplishment!!", "I hope they both keep the love for reading and writing!", "Oh no! I'm so sorry!  Are you able to be up for another one soon?", "Oh great! That's sooner than in my company.  I know you'll get one. Just keep working hard and good luck!", "It happens to the best of us! I know the lady understands!", "Maybe you'll never see her again! ", "Sorry to hear that, I know that you probably feel disappointed but there will be other opportunities! ", "Yes, and you will succeed eventually. ", "Do you have some uncertainty in you life right now?", "That is really tough.  Are you in a career now?", "Do you have any opportunity for an internship of some sort?  The career advisers from your school may be able to help.", "I did that myself, and I can tell you it was well worth it.  I am much happier now than I ever was.  I wish you very good luck on whatever you decide to do!", "As in living alone or single?", "Oh no. Thats terrible. ", "Oh wow, I'm sorry to hear that! Put your leg up and relax this weekend! ", "I hope your insurance does too! Just take care of youself and I hope you feel better soon!", "That sounds really frustrating to deal with. You sound like you're self-aware and anticipating the problem, though. Perhaps you've already started preparing to look elsewhere?", "Well, luckily Google is so helpful these days. There's tons of templates out there. It's kind of annoying to deal with, especially because it's being motivated by your company possibly disappearing.. but it won't take long at all to craft a good one, especially because oftentimes the shorter they are, the better", "Nice. Did you find a good hairdresser?", "That is great.", "I am sorry to hear that! My dog is a part of the family, so I understand. I hope everything is okay.", "It is scary to think about, I hope for the best!", "what did you do?", "that is a cool job", "That's great. Where are you going?", "Sounds like a great trip. I hope you guys have a fun time.", "That is exciting. When is she due?", "Yes it is! Is she having a boy or a girl?", "Awww! Congratulations! I hope everything goes smoothly.", "I totally understand.  Life can sometimes seem overwhelming.  I have learned to stop, take a deep breath, and do one thing at a time.", "It's just a way to calm the body and the mind.  It is SO easy to fall into the trap of anxiety.  But falling there doesn't accomplish a thing.  Take a breath, focus on one small success, then move to the next.  ", "Well, for me, I am honestly angry.  I look at their success and feel it should be me!  ", "You are probably right.  I feel like such a terrible friend for feeling that way.  Nevertheless, it is a little motivation for me to work that much harder.  ", "Woah, hope she doesn't report you! Jk", "I see, hope she is able to understand!", "School Counseling.", "I would be a school counselor, so how to deal with issues in school and also development.", "What game and what kind of award>", "Way to go! That is a great accomplishment!", "Oh wow that is so exciting! I'm sure you are excited to move in.", "Aww that's great! I have two dogs, they become part of the family! Enjoy your new house :)", "You sound very content. What makes you happy?", "Well that is a good reason. You are blessed.", "Oh no, I would have had a heart attack.", "Sell the house!", "Nice, how was it?", "Hope you're all right!", "Are you doing the cheesecake for your family?", "That is great.", "That's really nice! You should show her you appreciate her. Maybe cook her dinner!", "Ahh yes, that's very nice too, good for her! You guys have a happy marriage.", "Ugh that must so inconvenient and uncomfortable! ", "I can relate, I get red face when ever I have to come infront of the class to present. ", "Oh gosh, is he going to take you to the Superbowl at least?", "Just one ticket, that sounds lonely for him.", "Nice! I want to take my daughter when she is older. Did you go to Disneyland or world?", "California is fun to visit as well! Glad you all had fun.", "aww that is great!", "yeah my mom did that for me a few years back", "Oh naughty. Did anyone see you?", "Well it's not a huge deal in the grand scheme of the universe! I am sure it will be fine.", "Yes! We are driving up to see them on Monday.", "It is a 7 hour drive. It takes  a little longer with bathroom breaks though.", "That would definitely be a difficult thing to find out. How did you find out?", "Wow. That is really horrible. I am so sorry that happened to you. ", "Haha.. I feel like that's almost a rite of passage when going to water parks. I've had that happen, too. Hopefully it wasn't too traumatic for you. I almost lost my glasses once, too! Now that was really scary", "That's the spirit. It's good that you don't take yourself too seriously. Heck, my roommate walked in on me doing some \"self-pleasure\" just yesterday.. I used to think that was my worst nightmare, but in the moment I just did my best to laugh it off so we could move forward faster", "I hate when that happens! The same thing happened to me when I moved out of my apartment. They kept my security deposit because they needed to replace carpet.", "Mine hadn't been replaced in 6 years, I found that out after the fact. ", "That's pretty awesome, congrats", "Confidence is key, it's honestly what upper management looks for not necessarily technical skills right off the bat...just like Leo DiCaprio in \"Catch Me if You Can\" haha", "Good on you. You need to be comfortable in your own skin and its not other people's business to tell you how to live. ", "Yes, they should really learn to concentrate on their own life instead of complaining about other people.", "Did you get up to check it out?", "That would have scared me. At least it wasnt an intruder.", "that is exciting@", "yeah same but it can be fun", "That is an amazing talent to have. I would be so scared!", "Me too, that would be terrible.", "I hope you did it. Don't worry too much.", "If you need to you can always take it again. Good luck!", "What happened? Hope you are okay?", "Omg that is so scary, I am so sorry to hear that. ", "Yeah I found some old pictures of when us kids used to go to my grandma's house for xmas", "Yeah reminds me of the good old days.  I miss my grandma.  She passed away about 15 years ago. ", "Oh hey that's awesome!  That is awesome right?", "That is awesome!!!! Congratulations!"]
