He was my favorite character!", "I know how you feel, I'm sorry about that, at least he probably came back pretty quickly.", "Where did you end up going?", "I really hope you get it!", "That was probably for the best anyway. People who drive like that are the worst, though.", "Have you talked to him about it?", "im sorry, i hope you're able to find an even better job immediately", "Wow, that sounds terrifying. You are very lucky to have made it out without any property damage though.", "How many kids do you have?", "Well at least you didn't have a lot of people under foot to slow you down. So I hope the sacrifice of being bored was worth it.", "That is the worst. At least you and your husband got something worked out for your son's first day at school!", "Oh I bet! It's always good to cherish those memories.", "hahah that's kinda funny. Maybe he just missed you!", "Oh, that is really cool! What a great experience, and fun to bond with your dad!", "That's long, I understand the reason behind you being upset", "Thank God you will be able to tell them in person about how much you miss them", "oh no.

What brought you to Haiti, if you don't mind me asking?", "That story could become a movie script.", "Try drinking a lot of water and cutting out soda", "You should find another job. No use being miserable. Or tell her boss!", "Ah, gotcha. A few of my friends teach English to Chinese students online and I think they have taken ESL courses", "I do too.  I am so sorry you are going through this", "I know. I wonder if they still do that show", "I just went on a trip with my mom and sh paid for almost everything", "Ah, gotcha.

It's so cool you had that opportunity.", "Ah, I see. The classic photo trick. I understand why you would be upset about that. That's definitly why it's so important to go see before you buy", "Oh, I'm well thank you.", "Wow really? That's pretty rude and bad in general for an employee to be doing.", "That's neat! I've only seen ducks and chickens. A deer did bounce over my car once, though", "And more to come hopefully!  Don't forget to save for retirement and/or emergency fund :D", "Am doing well thanks and you?", "fine. But, I think you're suppose to do the prompts, so hope it doesn't cause you a rejection.", "That's good to hear! Hope that it continues that way.", "It's highway robbery. Well I can only hope you can pay it quickly to avoid as much of that as possible.", "That's great , sorry for the error and unrelated message previously sent :) but you do have great friend that are dependable", "Its okay, at least now you can look back at it as a funny moment.", "Oh, it has been raining here a lot too. I will keep my fingers crossed that your wi-fi keeps working!", "Oh no, I bet that was stressful. What did you do?", "Oh that's is fun. It's a way to be alone with your thoughts, but still be around others. I love to watch people!", "Well, a great morning leads to a great day", "That is a very scary movie! How are you coping?", "That sounds like very bad treatment, You should sue them", "Maybe. It's none of my business but sometimes when people feel this way, they could be experiencing depression.", "You always have options!", "I used to work with a girl like that. She always talked bad about me but was nice to my face.", "I believe I see it more as that type. No one can truly know.", "Totally. I still love to go have a look around", "I understand.", "Generally just try to ignore it as best as you can. I'm good about just letting things roll off my back.", "That is a relief. Sounds like you made it just in time.", "Well sometimes companies make mistakes. I doubt it's anything you did.", "I think you can really think about all that you have, and show your thanks that you have these things.", "Oh, that sounds like a bummer. Do you think it will change?", "No, I ever did.", "yeah r/legaladvice has a lot of posts like that so its something that stuck to me, Pretty neat to know that landlords cant just scam you", "I get that. I got a bamboo tablet a few years ago, but I feel like working directly on the screen would be even better.", "oh that does sound nice", "True everything is nice in bits. Too much of anything does get tiring.", "I understand. I have to get work around my house done today too, before I can go out.", "I agree. Hope the car will look good again.", "I understand", "Oh I see, Ha! I would have just worn them like that to be more fashionable!", "Oh ! Thank good ness! That was close", "It must be difficult living with a nut allergy. Do you overeat on macadamia nuts regularly?", "That sucks!

It is nice to have good neighbors.", "That's good to know!  You all have a lot to be thankful for!", "I hope it wasn't too much money just in case.", "Really?? It sounds like there was something going on.", "I'm sure they were thinking waste not, want not. haha", "Ah, nothing quite like that feeling. I remember when I was on the school newspaper. Good times.", "Oh no, that sucks. Would you have wanted to go though?", "Does he do that stuff often?", "Oh that's nice of them!", "I think if you keep it up you'll get the recognition you want soon.", "True, you never know these days.", "You are so lucky! My phone would have been done...", "I bought a spin bike but I haven't used it yet", "He can't save them out in the open. What kind were they?", "You are a true friend indeed.

Sometimes people just don't click.", "Oh you can be as bad as you want there, it just matters if you're having fun :)", "I used to move furniture for my old job, so i bet it was a lot of heavy lifting, its so exciting to finally have your own place", "Oh man. That was a difficult subject for me after Physics. Are you a science major?", "You can make new friends. Its just part of the human experience. Everything is temporary", "Dogs are with us for such a short amount of time. Kinda wish they lived as long as us.", "What did they help you with?", "Oh man, Sometimes it's hard to strike that work life balance.", "Are you going to wear a suit?", "Yea. Seems to be more of that lately.", "Do you honk at them?", "Oh I've heard of those contests. Must be exciting to see.", "What happened? Why were they being limited?", "Interesting.

Wish you can buy one soon mate", "That is not too much, I think you made a good choice", "I am sorry to hear that, why did you move there?", "Well is it close to where you live?

Find peace knowing that she is in heaven now", "When i get married i want to be like you , and take care of my loved one", "Me, too--I'm sorrry you had to go through that.  At least it's over now, right?", "Yep, that's the way of the world, especially with Universities to.", "That  sucks.  I'd be very upset.      You have to be careful who you order from online.  Some times if the price is too goot to be true its a fake product.", "I would be so lost without my phone, but I could make it through an evening. The house keys though!", "So, it was your partner who used you card", "I'm not surprised.", "That's good. Time heals all wounds and can be a powerful cure to pain and disdain.", "Everyone is nostalgic one way or another.You are fine", "I'm sure this will be one of those times where you cringe when you think back on it! I'm sure you made those guy's days though", "Some horror movies are so great that they make you consider your own environment.", "That's cool. Taking that experience into the next phase will be pivotal.", "Do you have full cover?", "Did it happen while you were in the store? I hope that your kids did not see anything too disturbing.", "Yeah, we were blissfully unaware of the real world in those days. It must have been nice to reminisce.", "Cherish this time you have, because you never know when it could change!", "Sounds good. I love mom n pop restaurants. So much better than big popular restaurants.", "Well at least you are putting yourself out there. A lot of people give up on finding love.", "Dang, that sucks. I hope you can find a solution for that", "Geniuses don't do chores my friend.", "But a part of her is still here in you.", "I know that feeling. I like to keep the TV on to drown out the silence", "I know right. I would be so furious!", "Yeah, something should be done about it!", "Who cares! I always like to think of satisfying myself first before others!", "What a pain! I bet that cost a fortune. Did they end up repairing all the portions of yard that they had to rip up?", "He was lucky to have you waiting there for him!", "Well, that was nice of them. I hope you take them out to dinner after you pay them back.", "Well, keep at it and you will get where you want to be. It really just comes down to how many calories you take in vs. how many calories you burn per day.", "lol That's how I would of reacted too. One hundred dollars can buy you a lot of stuff.", "Hopefully they remember", "Maybe you could give them a call on the phone and tell them about your feelings?", "Yea, and you can bring some water toys to play with!", "How much total weight did you lose, and how long did it take?", "Cruises are awesome.

I hope she does well as an artist!", "Yeah, I can see that viewpoint as well. She may end up carrying you to bed next time!", "My mom was the same way. It's all part of being a parent. I hope to have kids soon too and I worry about stuff concerning them myself!", "Yes, those memories are what make life so special.", "That's sweet.", "I have 2 dogs myself and I could never imagine hurting them.  I can't believe there are people out there who think that that is ok. its sick.", "That sounds really cool. I always wanted a treehouse but never had a good tree for it.", "Or you could just park behind them so that they would have to knock on your door before you let them out.", "Ooh I live pretty close to it. You have a great husband to give you that treat!", "You are blessed. Make sure to spread the positive energy.", "That's great. Be thankful, some people aren't so lucky.", "try googling it, and read thru the reviews", "You got a figure in mind for your house or are you letting the agent handle that as well?", "Know it alls are the worst.  Hopefully you are in a better spot now, with a manager who cares.", "We can surely hope!", "I sincerely hope you can find him! But I bet your neighbor will understand it was just a mistake and you didn't do it on purpose.", "You might have to file a noise complaint with the police.", "Yeah, I've done that as well.  It can definitely be a hard job, considering dealing with the public, hours during holiday seasons, etc.. But sometimes if the pay is good, it can outweigh some of the negatives.", "wow , i would love to have a cat like yours", "haha that must have been a crazy concert!", "Well, I'm not entirely sure about the banking side but I wonder what she's looking for. Perhaps a small vs big bank culture", "Still, a new color can definitely brighten up a space and make it feel all new!", "Ha!!  Well I've woken up from a dream and been mad at my husband because of something he did in my dream - I guess it can go the other way too!", "Some of it but my grandma did save a lot.  I plan on doing that with my kids", "Gouda is great! Do you like prosciutto too?", "That's great to hear. You have one tough cat.", "True! McDonald's was my first job when I was 14 and I remember being stoked I could now collect ALL the toys even if I didn't play with them!", "I pray they get in touch with you soon and that's is an affirmative on the job!  I know  how nerve-wracking waiting can be though - I hope you get it!", "I hear you. Maybe humor might help? Like okay, so *this* is awkward....can we talk about that email? Heartfelt apologies go a long way, and even if she doesn't respond -- you'll feel better for trying.", "I would have complained.", "Ohh, that's bad. You can always skype your family!", "Me too! You seem just like me!", "That's so cool! I wish you the very best and hope that the blood sweat and tears turns into happiness, joy and fun times!", "Wow, I hope that she was able to work things out. Not the best way to start living somewhere far from home, but I'm sure she figured something out.", "Yeah, and they are paying you good enough. You are a luckiest person!", "same thing i heard too , really long and boring being there against your will", "Aww that's great! What breed?", "Good I'm glad to hear that.  That's a long time.  Hospitals scare me, I can't imagine being there for that long", "Oh my gosh that's horrible. I hope they caught the person who hit her!", "how many cats do have?", "Nice, I have an australian shepherd. He follows me around everywhere.", "Neither did we. He seemed so healthy, and then within weeks he was so sick he couldn't even talk. I miss him every day,", "that sounds like a well deserved plan.", "Life is full of experiences like that, they seem scary from the outside, but once you relax you get swept away", "Sometimes by remembering all the places that you have been in the past two days can help. I will try that!", "The frustration they go through well at least we don't have to take the kids or parents home.", "Could you get a rain check? That is a bummer?", "That's really awesome! She sounds like a great person to work with.", "That's probably what I would do also. It won't kill him to wait another day.", "Hopefully the person learned what they had to do so they don't hold the line up in the future.", "Sounds like your friend broke bro code, that was kind of scummy.", "That's great. It's nice to have people so close to you. It really helps in bad times", "That's awesome, she'll have a great time and learn a lot i'm sure!", "Bills do take up a lot, don't they.", "How did you discover exactly what it was?", "I'm the same way haha. But how was it fun if you have your eyes closed the whole time?!", "You went through a lot of losses.", "Yeah i bet that was really embarrassing, but I'm glad you're okay.", "Amazing! Congratulation! Prayer is always a good thing to do! That is so incredible.  Are you enjoying the job?", "The super nintendo is a classic. What is your favorite game?", "I bet they didn't.  I like to look at experiences as part of our journey and teaches us to have compassion for others in similar situations.  So glad you're alright! Hope you own a helmet!", "Thank goodness. Hurricanes are no joke.", "I bet he is. Don't worry", "Saving money is important", "She's also a hard worker.", "Good to know there is still kind people in the world.", "That was really sweet of him, maybe he just wanted you to know you're loved.", "That was very smart thinking on your part. Have fun on your trip!", "Thats usually how it goes", "hahaha I definitely admire your courage to have done that.", "I am sure you will meet them", "I would have been disappointed, too.", "Oh right, I spent some time in Florida when I was younger and I remember it being so unpredictable. Just gotta keep an umbrella all the time lol.", "Good for her! Moms get a lot done lol", "I bet. I she moving school or a job?", "Awesome. What is your job?", "That is so good congratulations you are lucky what are you going to use it for?", "Oh no! But that happens (it has happened to me several times). At least you had the great workout!", "Is it your dream job? Then you should really be happy.", "I bet, I will get there one day", "Yeah and they really should be better about how they place their racks", "We live and we learn lol", "I have not either", "No idea! I haven't had cable in so long! I would HATE that and they always over charge! Don't they have a rule that theres no service fee if they are late?", "I could do so much with $120. Im jealous lol", "ah, crisis averted! that could have been a lot worse", "That's great. Sundays are supposed to be breezy", "Oh, so it was no big deal? At least you cared enough to stop someone and ask them about it. No harm, no foul.", "That sounds perfect", "Well at least think about the fact that it's a good thing to go to the dentist!", "You should ask the airport people if they have any security footage of the parking lot, maybe they can track down the car.", "It is nice that you enjoyed it.", "Well I can understand your nervousness.  I probably would be on guard as well", "It is like losing a family member isn't it.  Well, just think of all the good times and be thankful.", "Oh yes. But, I found that getting involved in clubs along with a major I liked actually allowed me to spend less time studying and more time learning for fun. It's a subtle, but important diffeence", "I hope where ever you go, you visit someplace amazing!", "You are lucky.", "Hopefully you had a lock on them, you can never be too safe.", "That means that he is always listening and paying attention to you!", "I bet it does wake you up right away. I guess I should try that sometime if I oversleep. lol !", "No I have never dealt with a rude person like that that lives near me", "Sounds fun. Ill be ready. Hope were going to the beach thats closest to us!", "Having positive attitude always succeed. Keep it up.", "Is that a reference to the color of the hair, the shape or something else?", "I would argue most good employers can diagnose incompetence from the first or second conversation. If they can't, maybe they aren't good employers.", "I'm sure it will. At least it gets us to enjoy life more and focus on the moment.", "I think it is merely a coincidence.", "Oh, I see. I thought that some other bad things happening in your personal life are making you cry", "Our thoughts are were everything starts. Mindset is so important.", "That would be nice, but it's never good to dwell on things like that instead of looking toward the future.", "I hate getting pulled over too. Especailly for something silly like being a couple of miles an hour over the speed limit", "Don't be so hard on yourself. We are all humans, we make mistakes.", "That really sucks. How long will it be going on?", "Well, then congratulations!  I wish you the best of luck, and enjoy this time! :)", "Oh man! That is why I watch movies at home. It's just more comfortable.", "right, i feel you but maybe it will be good to get it all out!!", "great, I am very glad to hear she is getting better!", "Well congrats then, I am sure that is not easy", "Oh gosh, hopefully it doesnt happen next time", "It is good to have those and look at once in awhile", "Did you try therapy at all or counseling?", "I am sorry to hear that, I hope things improve for you a ton!", "Ok", "That is awful and very sorry you had to go through that. I work at a cancer hospital so I can't imagine going through that with a loved one.", "Oh okay, I love going through my old stuff too, it is really fun", "I hope you both have tons of fun!", "i'm one of those people. Eat junk food even though i know it's not good for me", "Exactly good luck", "Nice! I loved that show when I was a kid. I never had the lunch box though.", "That's good!  That will make your life much easier!  Congratulations!", "What all is on the agenda for the date?", "Boo.

I hope it was quick and painless.  I hate seeing anything suffer!", "Awesome. Alls well that ends well.", "Where does she plan to go?", "Yeah, definitely.

I hope you're doing okay - I'm sure your dog was very loved and had a wonderful life, so try to take comfort in that.", "I bet that is nice and probably has good benefits!", "I can no longer afford them, long trips cost the most.", "How ironic. I kind of wish I were there to see it.", "I still could not do that, I am very weak human person.", "I still thing living with a relative is the cheapest way to go.", "Yea...the education costs are atrocious and, honestly, not even worth it on my opinion. It's just the piece of paper. The material you learn from them can be learned online for free or nearly so", "What kind of job do you have?", "I hope you would wear a belt next time.", "I'm sorry.  I like my job but its certainly not like hers!", "eww LOL", "What all did they do for you?", "I thought I would take longer, like months!", "Lol, That sounds like a plan.

I would be a bit jealous :(", "That is horrible news, I am so sorry for your loss.", "I hope so too.  What kind of work is it?", "I can understand. I am really sorry", "That is so sad. I hope they recover okay. Hopefully you weren't in trouble for being late either.", "Awesome! I'm not a father yet, but I can only imagine your kids growing up and leaving to live their own lives.", "Yeah, had a similar scuffle with my wife, but being married sometimes you just have to forgive and forget.", "You should always have bug spray on you at all times.", "I'm sure you are fine. I bet it is just a tree branch or something like that. Maybe a neighbor could go look for you.", "Thats amazing, financial stability can be a life changer.", "True, because regretfully I act that way sometimes too.", "I like to do both as well. TV if I'm feeling lazy, reading if I feel more ambitious.", "Oh that sounds awful!

You can also call your friends to hang out if you have close ones", "Maybe she was around, but it wasn't time for the ball yet.", "I hope you guys have a great time. Just the two of you.", "I've never been to a Beyonce concert. Always sold out! I'm glad you got to see her.", "You should definitely be proud of yourself. Pat yourself on the back.", "Wow, I hope you're getting paid for all that extra time!", "I know it sucks, but i think you should have an open conversation to your girl about this", "Interesting. I hope you do find it. I don't know how you brush your hair.", "I am so sorry to hear you're going through this. Hopefully, it's nothing.", "I always wanted that level of discipline. good for you :)", "Yep. Happy and healthy is a blessing", "yes. I wish I could send you a clip of it from the concert. It was awesome. Maybe you could catch def leppard next time.", "Oh, such great nostalgia.", "well hopefully you find a better path in life", "So true. I might become a lakers fan myself at this point", "Yeah, it works wonders for me when I can't sleep.", "I can feel your emotions. Find peace in knowing that Tom is at a better place now", "That's great to hear. It's always good to have a great family support structure when times are hard.", "I applaud your response.", "Ewwwww!  Hope the cat is okay!", "Don't worry everyone is nervous on the first day.", "i am so glad that you did", "so sorry to hear that.. hopefully things work out for you real soon", "Don't be. Just visualize yourself already having the job.", "Was it fun?", "You should. and get new friend", "Any free money is great.", "A new start and a new life, that is exciting! I hope you love it.", "i have been there, it is so lovely. you are going to love it", "Did anyone video it?", "I hope you're holding up then, I would be devastated if my pet died.", "yea i bet they are", "Have eyes for someone else", "it really does suck", "oh my lord!!! how did you sleep that night?", "Okay good.

I tried it once and I'm like you......NO MORE!", "Good to hear, how old was he?", "OH my word. I feel like I should watch them all over", "Does he has any record with heart problems?", "dang that is rough", "I'm so sorry to hear that, may he rest in peace.", "That is really a good way to be. I need to practice this more, myself!", "Indeed. Particularly, when i grab my phone and watch short clips from my favorite TV shows on Youtube", "I'm glad you were able to adjust.  It can be lonely without family around.", "That sucks.. Are you having trouble falling asleep?", "She is the most beautiful girl I have ever seen.", "nasty! did you tell him anything?", "I would have called the cops on her!", "That must have been a very big man.", "that nice, good for you", "oh that makes a lot of sense", "I want some of whatever you had for breakfast. You seem very happy.", "Hopefully that doesn't happen, and you have job security.", "That would make sense, though you could probably have smelt it if it was coffee.", "It definitely sounds that way, gonna upgrade it?", "yea it can be sore and you cant eat anything", "exactly what i do. we were never close growig up. we are now.", "Must be fun but unnerving as well. Whats your favourite horror movie?", "Your best friends?", "I love cookies especially oreo's they are my favorite", "Did you go with your cousins?", "I was too", "Don't worry.

I have actually own a couple red sports cars.", "Thats nice, i wish you the very best for your results!", "You should. He is obviously at the very least flirting with you and at worst harassing you", "That is very true.

I'm jealous lol", "Thats great. I know he appreciates it", "Good luck!", "they live that long ? interesting", "Well congratulations! That must have been nerve-wracking.", "Do it! I bet you deserve it", "Well I am glad it worked out", "Oh no, are you going to talk to him about the dangers of drugs?", "That's so cool!  I'm gonna have to check it out", "Great, you've found an old treasure.", "Just try and get through each day, one at a time. Don't think too far ahead.", "If this were a movie, I'd be yelling at the screen for you to leave the house and not go down there.", "What test?", "I'm sure the memories will be great", "Im sorry about that. Ive gone through that before. Laughter can be good medicine sometimes", "Okay, well I guess I'm happy for you then.", "Oh, so it got pretty serious.  I guess he needs to learn to respect boundaries.", "I bet that was very nostalgic for you.", "So what are you going to do about?  Are you going to start looking for another place to work?", "I wouldn't worry too much about it then.  Don't let it get you down.", "Well, it was worth $500!

It helps with stress.", "Is there anything you can put on them or near them to stop him?", "That is great, I commend you!", "Well Im sure you be fine. Just relax.", "That's great! Keep up the good work!", "maybe he will start warming up to it soon", "That's awesome. I'm glad she did well.", "Oh I just quit a few weeks ago due to a similar situation actually! Never been happier!", "Don't worry then.  You did you part!! I'm sure you will do fine!", "Yes being alone is not very fun.", "You should have a great time, congrats on the new age!", "If your depressed, speak to someone.

Thats insane.", "I am so sorry for your loss. I hope that you find peace in this difficult time.", "Sometimes being a manager is the worst job you can have at a place, you seem to be the one who gets blamed for everything.", "I'll keep my fingers crossed for you that you get that promotion next time!", "That is great! I wish I was lucky like that!", "Ugh noooo! Thats terrible i am so sorry. :(", "Hopefully! that would be so amazing!", "Ah okay, nice for the kiddos then. They grow up fast, so hold onto these moments while you can:)", "Have you talked to her about it? Maybe she doesn't really think about it anymore.", "That was very nice of him. I'm glad you have a nice husband.", "Thats so silly its none of his worry. He needs to hush up. lol", "Well at least you managed to save him!", "That's the worst! Some people, once they get started, they just can't stop themselves. It's like opening a can of Pringles.", "Oh no, that's awkward! Did you get in trouble for it?", "Yes, and when they love you it feels special, because they don't love everyone like dogs do. You've racked up a lot of good karma for saving them!", "Yeah, that's right. I've been pushing 70 hours working a week for as long as I can remember. Hold out, maybe it'll change.", "Im glad it paid off for you, you must be super proud!", "That is tough. That must have been quite the trying time. Did you eventually find work?", "I hope you all have some fun.", "It is the best season, by far! Plus, Halloween!", "Seriously, gone is good.  They do have bacteria on them and lay their eggs on fruit and veggies and the larva burrow into the fruit or veggie so its good you trashed it all. Glad you're free of them!", "It really gets stressful when you get down to the last minute. You are always so worried you are going to forget something.", "haha thats pretty fun", "Oh I see, I can understand your concern. Perhaps he will live longer than most hamsters!", "I hope you go far in your job!  Good luck!", "Well I certainly hope that the dog gets to feeling better. Are you close friends with this canine companion?", "Poor little thing, chicken pox are the worst. On the bright side, you still got to spend your anniversary with your husband, just not, you know, in the way you hoped. Hope you guys get to have a make-up weekend soon!", "Exactly!", "yea i would be to", "Nostalgia is a weird feeling.", "Sound great, I'm happy for you!", "Congratulations!  I wish I could be published.", "It's a good idea to write thing down that you might forget.", "I am so sorry. I hope you get all the help you need.", "Yeah I know what you mean. I can't wait for the rainy season to end.", "Ditto. It's not hard to do, and so many lives would be saved if people would just follow the rules. I'll send good vibes out so nothing bad happens to you in the future!", "Oh I feel you, I used to work in the wedding industry. It's crazy how much it costs even for the most basic wedding.", "Well I say go for it. It is only your birthday once a year. The other 364 days can make up for it.", "That is true. It puts things in context.", "It does! Kids can understand things about the bible that most adults overlook.", "that is unfortunate, im sorry that happened!", "Are you going to get another cat?", "I agree!  Everything that surrounds Christmas makes me smile and feel content.  It makes me thankful for everything good in life!", "That's inspiring to me. I will try to think more like that as well whenever I get stressed in life.", "Have you been a long time runner before that?", "Haha, I can understand the hesitation then.  But was the vacation at least worth the money?", "Oh wow. I'll be honest and say it wouldn't be worth it for me! What's an extra 40K if you're never not at work to enjoy it?", "Maybe she's more athletic than you think! She might be better than you soon. Better watch out!", "oh man those are super nice! all electric is pretty neat", "That's awesome, and I agree, the job market is tough now a days.  High paying or not.", "That's a bad attitude to have. I hope he can straighten up a bit if we wants to keep working there.", "I wish my insurance would give me something like that! It's good to go anyways.", "Good luck, I'm sure you will do fine!", "It's ok to have a cheat day everyone once in a while, but you can't give in. Be strong!", "Oh no. I hope it goes well for you. That's a lot of hard work.", "Was it more than expected?", "LOL", "can you fix it?", "Has it been easy or hard to do that?", "well at least you are attempting to be honest about it.", "Ohh that stinks. I dont blame you though", "Those are definitely the scary types, they don't recognize social cues at all.", "Oh good.  Hopefully she'll try to fix it with physical therapy first.  Some doctors love to do surgery right away when its not necessary.  Recommend that she get a second opinion.  Hope she resolves it!", "Next time bring your lunch in a biohazard bag, maybe they will leave it alone.", "You definitely can't be too careful these days", "ok", "Yeah, I know they definitely suit some people. I actually now technically have one... my roommate wanted to get one, and I felt too bad to say no. And he actually is a pretty nice guy, mostly because he's been affectionate from the start. So, we'll see how it goes! Sorry again about your mat.", "Yeah and I bet the higher paycheck will make the work worth it.", "Oh, well that's something, at least. I can't believe people are such cowards, though.", "Well that is awesome. I bet they won't let you down in the new positions either", "Well that's some sort of motivation lol", "Oh geeze, I didn't know I was talking to a genius.  How long is the program?", "What school is this you are talking about?", "Sounds like you have a plan laid out. It also sounds like you've already accomplished so much.. You should be very proud. I'm with you, I have over $40,000 in student loans. Such a crazy pressure on someone right when they graduate. Good luck!", "You must love him very much, that's good.", "The best thing to do is join clubs and get involved. You generally make friends by association!", "same with me if i ever see someone that could use my help, i will most likely bring it to you", "Well, keep a good attitude. If you like the work and the job, hopefully that will be enough.", "I would suggest moving on time heals all wounds", "What a lovely woman, and you're lovely, too!", "That sounds like a good idea. I hope you solve the problem quickly!", "Well, maybe yours. Mine just want to sit inside and play on their phones all day.", "I AGREE and frankly if your boss does not see this and doesn't give you praise then I would quit as well or contact human resources! This kind of stuff is not acceptable.", "that sounds delicious i love chocolate cake i think that would be my favorite dessert", "That's hard but great of you to do, good luck.", "Nice! Do you have anything in specific you want to buy?", "did you still eat it? or did you throw it away", "Well, I'm happy for you :) It shows that they care", "It depends, if you love her, you could try to work it out.  Or you could cheat on her too", "I'm trying to teach mine tricks myself* I think that's fun to watch!", "That's your decision to make, but I think it would at least put you in control of the situation.", "I understand. Sticking with what you know seems safer.", "true that, you cant be too sure until you use it", "Sounds good. Your supervisor must proud of your work and your displayed high self-esteem", "Call the bank and get it fixed ASAP! That's got to be so annoying for you!", "Yeah I feel like you get lucky once then it's all downhill from there.", "i love when the rain his the soil in the open field , the smell of wet dirt is just refreshing", "sounds like a real good time i hope you enjoy it", "You will be alright buddy", "That is great, well there is still time to go this year!", "That sounds great. A nice long walk in perfect weather. There's hardly anything better.", "I feel you! I know its hard having siblings sometimes! Go buy a toy car and park it on top of his.", "Be sure to do it, otherwise they could keep harassing you", "I never took chemistry. Do you feel prepared for the test?", "nice.  what do you do for a living", "Perhaps there is an all natural remedy you could try", "Nice! I used to live in St. Paul, MN.  Weather's like a tundra which is why I'm down here", "Oh wow! That would be annoying!", "That would be nice but not fun that you don't have the same days off.", "i can imagine, i hope you have a great time this year", "So they don't even have teachers yet? Wow, that's crazy.", "What about online friends?", "i totally understand that. i'm sorry.", "That is good to hear.", "That's so generous of you. It's people like you that make the work week bearable!", "That's awesome. I'm glad it worked out well for you. :)", "Well that was nice. How long were you stuck there", "I have absolutely no idea what Boglins are, but I'm sure they were awesome!", "Great to hear that you made it out ok!", "Well, i am sure you are disappointed, but all you can do now is just get back on the diet again and try to be more dedicated. It's hard, I know!", "Oh hey, I'm a nursing graduate! It'll be difficult at first, but you'll get the hang of it.", "Awwww, I am so sorry. Have you thought about getting a new pup?", "It will be ok in the end.", "Ok glad you did not get injured. I hope your car gets fixed.", "I wish yo the best", "That is cool. Is your mother still alive?", "Good", "you ever ever plan to get another ?", "Amazing! Well done to him.", "Heat wave is getting so terrible theses days. I even watched on CNN that the whole of New South Wales is experiencing a drought, so sad", "People like that should just do shopping online instead of ruining the experience for everyone else!", "Why is that?", "well yea thats true", "Exactly, i am overcome with nostalgia and get tears of joy sometimes.", "That's good... I can't wait for my vacation!", "Maybe someone should train the kid to be stronger... by beating him up!", "i agree with you buddy", "Sounds like the trip went well. I am glad you enjoyed it!", "its just life", "I have never heard of such a breed. Must be so cute!", "glade all was well", "Great! I hope you get the job. I'll be rooting for you!", "No kidding.

Congrats!", "That's fun", "I hope in time you are able to feel better.... and that your heart will be filled with happy memories.", "Sweet! I really like Ducati's they are beautiful bikes.", "That must be really scary to go through.", "Yeah- I understand that. I don't let anyone drive my car, either. I hope everything worked out okay!", "Well, they sound like they are actually just a nice person trying to help you out, that is really nice.", "I bet it was! I love looking at photo albums", "That is good.", "I usually get out after finishing work to feel less lonely.", "I'm sorry it happens to us at times.", "I hope you have fun with that money.", "I wouldn't be either. Are you going to try to talk to your coworker about it?", "They will really appreciate that when they are older and look back on it.", "how did you feel at that time", "Good thinking. I'm sure the parent bunnies appreciated that.", "Oh good, I'm glad the entire garden didn't get ruined.  I would love to plant a garden one day soon since I went vegan plant based about 3 months ago.  Happy tomato eating to you!", "Well at least they cleaned up after. I would have been more annoyed if they didnt.", "That sounds great, I hope you succeed.", "Yum. I wish I had a green thumb.", "Well I'm glad you get to enjoy some nice weather for a change!", "ok im at the south east", "I wish people would take responsibilities for their own actions", "At least it sounds like you recovered everything!", "Sorry, that was an error! Any way over to your conversation.Who did you cut off that made you feel bad?", "I just hope it doesnt rain this weekend.", "Good for you! I bet you will do amazing. Best of luck!", "i get that. i work all day then come home to the same routine everyday.", "Haha, same! Just one more hour for me. Hope you can enjoy it soon!", "That is never a good thing, I hope they land on their feet", "Oh, well that is a nice surprise though!", "Exactly, I would report them, so nasty", "I hope so too, get it checked out!", "I hope you win that one! Good luck!", "I feel that way about my grandma, it is sad that by the time we are born they are so old", "I would hate that", "oh, I am sorry to hear that, why did they move away?", "That is nice to have", "i bet. hope you all have a fantastic time!", "Are you guys in good relations?", "thats good that you have progressed", "Lol- Well poor you. I have always had guys doing the same and it means nothing to me. If I am in a relationship..or heck even when I am not..I don't get interested in random people generally. I have to know who someone is..Remember that- what lasts is WHO someone is...Someone you want to grow old with..Bodies won't last.", "Was it suppose to scare you?", "Well I hope it lasts forever", "That's good. I am sure you will do great on it.", "I'd avoid that taxi driver again if you have the chance.", "Yes, don't let that stop you. Also pay attention to what you eat as well. It's even more important than the exercise portion.", "That's great! It's definitely a good thing when you can be yourself.", "It must've been nasty like puke", "I like that, how long have you felt this way about life?", "it is easier to walk around when its sunny also", "Yes, some people have to stay away form law enforcement jobs.", "That is wonderful.

Did the police get called? I hope you didn't get in trouble.", "Amazing! and Exotic", "Caring for both the young and the old. Any hospital would be lucky to have you on staff!", "Ha! Do you feel bad about it?", "I know that feeling. Something will come through though", "It is Friday, that would be a nice way to start the weekend!", "Have you tried yoga? It can help in the meanwhile till you get a proper vacation.", "But you have recovered now. Right?", "Congratulations! That's brilliant news", "Hard work always pays off! Keep it up.", "Man! That's pretty bad.", "good luck!", "Now you can celebrate this exam result!

Have a good weekend :D", "Well, it must've been something you said.", "Does she play any sports?", "It'll be well worth it when she gets the hang of it, but urgh. Bathroom problems are why I don't think I want a kid anytime soon!", "Well, happy anniversary! What was your present?", "I'm sorry.. Not everyone is bad.  Just a lot of people.", "Do you have anything in mind?", "Just remember to never invite you ex-roomate to your new place, EVER!!!!!!", "I would be upset too.  However, I wouldnt get discouraged though.  There may be another opportunity even better that comes along soon.", "Well, hopefully there will be nothing but great things for him in his future.", "That is good to hear.  What will he be doing?", "It's a huge step, congratulations!", "Guilt can be a terrible thing to live with.", "I hope he can get the help he needs and maybe a job he enjoys more.", "LOL, well, that's good to know. So am I!", "That would be a surprise.  A lot of people are not dedicated enough to change their condition, especially those with diabetes.", "I think so, you're two peas in a pod.", "A walk will definitely help.

I love it", "I'm glad that it all worked out!", "I'm sure he will love that. I bet you will see the joy just shining in his eyes.", "That is hard!

Good Luck!", "I have and it really hard.

I bet you are just over the moon happy!", "Yes some things", "Well, it can save you a bunch of money!  Plus you gain the time that you would normally spend going out somewhere and you can use that time to have more of a break.", "Yikes! Why in the world would somebody do that?", "No! I'm sure you are not as monster-ish as you think!", "Moms are the best", "That is too bad, will you ever camp again?", "Did you take them out for drinks after the meeting?", "i would have loved to do the same", "I hope you can get over that pain.", "That's great. I hope you do! Maybe this time you can get $40. But gamble only in moderation!", "Well forget them! If they don't care about you you don't need to care about them", "well that sounds pretty fun!", "Excellent!", "oh well maybe next time", "wow thats great!", "Some people can't hold their liquor.", "Man that sounds aweful.", "Absolutely", "Would you say you're more of an introvert?", "Oh wow, that does sound horrible", "dang thats awesome!", "Wow!

Did you do something special?", "Do you get a raise?", "Are you interested in mortgage for now?", "If you share the fridge, I'd let her know if it causes an odor or might affect the other food.", "Oh.

It is sometime nice to just rest at home.", "Well, if you promised I would try to go. I'm sure it'll be fine.", "I hope it goes well for you and brings happiness to you both.", "I agree, just remember her for all the good memories.", "What an interesting course! I hope you do really well. Exams can be so scary- they can cause such anxiety.", "I understand. The best thing is to move.", "You got lucky for sure!  I can't imagine how scary that would be", "I usually don't let a little rain stop me unless it's ridiculous!", "you sound too kind. You'd be a great dog mother/father!", "It sounds like you really enjoy it!  Good for you!", "I hope you guys have the best time!", "Sounds like the best course to me :)", "You should just make a plan and do it. It sounds like it is worthwhile.", "Hopefully they get your order correct the next time you order there!", "Did it taste good?", "You must have great co workers. I bet your happy everyday you go to work", "yes , he be rest in peace", "Glad everyone is safe! You were very smart.", "You should adopt a rescue dog. That would be great for the family.", "Did you get a refund at least? I would never visit that restaurant ever again if I were you!", "Not too much longer! I hope she adjusts well and enjoys herself.

Not this time unfortunatly, but it will in the end", "That is great that he was able to show you he is responsible. I bet you're proud.", "Wow, I admire his dedication! And you won't ever have to worry about your vehicle breaking!", "Be careful while negotiating your pay raise. Some managers may find it too intrusive and that may leave bad impression on them", "I definitely remember trying something like that when I was a kid.  I think sometimes kids think they're sneakier than they actually are.", "Man, you are a good friend!  I would have been beyond angry!", "Indeed. Friends should be together in times of need. That is what friends are for", "oh man... It happened to me before, i know how embarrassing it is.", "Well at least he passed - that's great!", "I will do that, i had no idea.", "I'm sure it will be different when it's a parent.", "You will be a great manager! Good luck with everythig", "i hope it won't happen!", "I know what you mean. I've done stuff like that too - you do feel a bit silly, don't you!", "Maybe you can figure out a way to get all three of you guys something!", "Well I'm sorry you are going through this and I hope you can figure it all out.", "I eat steak and shrimp.", "agreed. you really won't be missing out on anything worthwhile.", "How exciting for you! Have fun!", "Well I hope you do well! Good luck.", "That's awesome! I didn't know that place was still in business.", "I hope they get better training so you don't have to argue with them about it", "That doesn't make much sense. Maybe I am missing the context.", "I would've too, but sometimes people need to learn a lesson.", "For real! Are you taking any precautions?", "Okay, that makes more sense then to me.", "I wasn't even aware there was a hurricane.", "Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. People are so inconsiderate!", "I would make a complaint to the principal if I were you!", "Wow that is aweful!", "I bet it was. I've only had one creepy experience - that was in an old house in West Virginia. I'm very careful to avoid those places these days!", "Great! I'm glad that it worked out well for you!", "Brings back all the memories you had as a kid.

People like that make me never want to have a roommate!", "Well, at least they didn't follow you. How is Cuba? My parents are from there but I've never been.", "Aw, that's too bad, hopefully next time they will be safe in the coop!", "nice, i hope that works out for you... good luck", "That's so gross, I would take a hard pass on eating that. I like seafood but that's too much.", "Did yall happen to get it on video?", "Haha brotherly love, I hope him and the lucky gal have a wonderful life together!", "i bet so!", "That can be stressful. I am sure that every thing with go smoothly for you! Just remember that the weekend is only 5 days away!", "Yeah nothing like calling the locksmith and admitting you are not very bright. Haha.", "Just be careful with that. If you feel tired due to stress, it may be the stress talking and not you.", "Wow, that's fantastic.", "What a jerk! That is definitely a problem!", "Well at least you don't have to take it again. Could have been worse.", "Glad you find humor in it! I dropped a bottle of water once, which rolled under the car. I was livid!", "Well, I guess the good news is that he no longer lives with you. But that blows, how hard is it to clean up after yourself before you leave?", "Hopefully the food was at least worth the wait. I would have been annoyed as well.", "Yeah, that's a real headache. I'd want to say they're worth it, but on that day I wouldn't be so sure, haha.", "It's almost a shame how much we depend on them, but I know I'd be lost without mine.", "Is there any kind of noise ordinance in your area?  I know in ours unless they are still running them at 11pm, there is nothing the police will/can do about it unfortunately - but I can imagine how annoying it is.", "Oh I hate ticks and all the bugs.", "You are lucky to have such great friends!", "ouch, that sounds awful", "Oh I see. Beautiful weather is an excellent start to the day!", "Aw, but they'll always be there for you when you visit. You have to do what you want to in life, after all", "How inconsiderate. People should have more common sense than your neighbor.", "me too!", "Well done. You should feel proud for teaching yourself.", "How are you celebrating it?", "That's really great. I am sure you will do well on the test.", "Well that is really lucky you were able to avoid that. Hopefully he didn't hurt anyone else.", "Understandably. My girlfriend is a student and works in retail part-time. She says the same thing.", "I really love that album! We will have to listen to it together sometime.", "I would've been very angry too. I hope the money went towards something useful.", "That really stinks. I bet you felt really lonely and filled my regret.", "Nice! I want to get that game next week. Looks really cool.", "I hope he doesn't let you down.", "That's amazing! Tell him congratulations from a friendly stranger.", "Hopefully he'll get to enjoy his next summer.", "I bet. I would've hid under the table.", "That's great to hear. I wish I had a helpful family.", "Well, at least that's the case. People can only do so much.", "Well sometimes that isn't a bad thing really. You didn't enjoy it at all?", "At least you have those memories. You should go on a vacation soon!", "I've actually haven't played that series. When does it come out?", "Yeah, I am in the same boat. It's a hard knock life out there.", "He must of been sick after.", "Wow, thats insane.  I feel like thats illegal", "Are you going to ground him?", "Why don't you get another job?", "Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. I hoep your family is strong enough to support you through this.", "Had they gone through anything?", "Those are the best times when they still like to play with toy's mine lost interest years ago and I miss it", "That sounds like you guys will spend a lovely time over there good luck", "I'm sorry, but I can't understand what you're saying.", "Oh lord, i am so sorry!

It's the best way to learn.", "May be worth letting your insruance comapny know. Usually they have clauses that you have to tell them as soon as you see it otherwise they won't cover any of it.", "oh that explains it!", "I'm only afraid that the mom is going to let out that embarassment on her child once they get home.", "That would be a memorable lesson to learn. The best lessons are learned that hard way, after all.", "Rest in peace whoever touches that rack.", "That sounds really frustrating. I'm sorry that's happening!", "You did the right thing!  Oh fun!  I'm glad you were safe and had a blast!", "Awesome, hope it goes as planned!", "Awww...that's a bit disappointing, but really cool that you got to see them!", "That would have been awesome if you got it.", "Maybe I could learn from that. I get really nervous when I have to do any public speaking, so maybe if I just prepared for it better it would help.", "It happens sometimes. you may ask them directly to pay back.", "That's awesome!  She will!  The best thing about homeschooling is that they can learn more at their own pace.  I'm not looking forward to division! ha ha", "I've never been hiking, really! I'd like to go some day.", "Perfect!  Now you'll be caught up in no time.  I know you'll be so gratified to finish and be able to look at all of them when he's much older.", "May your many memories of Sam help you to sustain at this difficult time.", "Exactly! You'll go far with that attitude!", "Personally I'm a huge fan of red velvet, but black forest is amazing too!", "Absence makes the heart grow fonder.", "Do you exercise often?", "Hey runts are the best! They need love too. Either way, I'm glad you were paired up with the perfect companion.", "It would be so much fun to go there as a family.", "They are too smart for their own good", "ewwww, so nasty! i almost ate a molded avocado today. good thing i noticed before scooping it", "did you try talking to her about it? Just be straight forward and tell you how you feel", "Its horrible to have to got through things like thaty", "Ooh, will you be managing anyone?", "Ugh! Were you away from home?", "Oh well that's great! Some people would get a little jealous. I'm glad you're proud of her, I'm sure she worked very hard for her success!", "Nice! No kids at home?", "I'm sorry to hear that, I'm pretty terrified of the dentist myself. Ask for gas! Good luck, I'm sure everything will be just fine.", "That's a great skill to have!", "I love that nostalgic feeling.", "Right!? It's weird, you buy them all the toys in the world, but they still go after your stuff.", "I understand. Could you plan to do something when he is late (going out with friends)?", "Hopefully! It is your dream car after all", "That will be nice to catch up.", "I wonder what could have changed? Either way, I'd be pretty pissed off.", "I understand. Layoffs are hard. My brother in law has been through a lot of those at factories!", "It must be difficult, do you think she will come back ever?", "Wow! That's like a paid vacation!", "Congrats to your friend. I hope they share!", "I'm sure she will be fine with some rest and a little bit of time.", "You're very lucky he was nice and didn't steal any of your data.", "Next time they let you in, just steal all your favorite pieces of decor and replace them with brownies.", "I have a 10 year old like that.", "you are very welcome. good luck!", "Yeah, It really sounds like she didn't mean to. Sometimes you can find copies online if you look.", "I think it might actually be harder to watch our kids go through that kind of loss than to actually go through it ourselves.  Our pup was our daughter's dog and she was sick prior to passing, so we knew it was coming.  Still doesn't really help though.  We ended up adopting a pup from the shelter that had lost her human mom - it was meant to me - my daughter lost her pup and this pup had lost her mom.  It's helped, something to think about at least.", "You can always show her the ways", "Im good at that lol", "I am not sure I would do well in that house", "Where did you guys usually go?", "Nice hope you win , ill be looking into this further", "Sounds like a wacky place to work.", "Good things happen to people who put in the effort. It sounds well deserved.", "I hope it's not a crazy person or worse, an alien waiting to abduct you!", "Yeah, that is a scary thing to think about too", "Hopefully he is not doing it out of spite!  Maybe you should hire a dog trainer to see if they can correct his behavior.", "Wow. That is horrible. I would get a camera and try to film them in the act and go to the police. I would be so angry.", "ah well it sounds like i hit the nail on the head", "Sales do sound hard to do", "I am glad then, I hate to see pets in pain", "Hahahaha, it's hard to compare yourself with that, but it really let's you know what's possible if you really want something.", "Do you think your boss will tell him it's you that told on him?", "Wow, so a proper adventure then. Have fun and stay safe!", "well at least its being put to good use", "Heyyy! That's awesome!  I wish you luck! Will it come with a sweet raise too?", "Good. I hope it will help her in career growth.", "ahhh.  I got you!  Well good luck on the relocation!", "Yeah, that is tough.  Once you get to a certain age you have to work pretty hard to meet people.  Maybe you could join a softball league, that's what I did.", "I bet that was a nice surprise", "Wow that is awesome, too rare in these times, count your lucky stars!", "Oh boy, I bet you were nervous.  I would've been too!  Sounds like she's got a great and fun year ahead of her!", "I hope the HOA does something about that - that's just disgusting!", "Did you get up to anything else fun?", "Of course! Dont let fear of not finishing stop you from doing anything!", "Yeah, I would probably just leave the restaurant altogether", "They can still bite, so it's better safe than sorry.  My father-in-law just got bitten by a black snake recently-not poisonous-but still painful.", "I just love when the house is clean, makes you feel good.", "I hope he got in trouble!", "Nursing can be difficult, but if you have determination and a good support system, I'm sure you'll do great!", "I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope another opportunity comes up.", "Mountain biking is great.  Is is really theraputic.  I hope you enjoy your new bike", "Yes! The weapons thing is so important.", "I understand that. Just give it some time and call when you are ready.", "That sounds like a wonderful place. I'm kinda jealous hahaha.", "No. I mean did you yell at the person or anything after they did it?", "it happens!! i hope you will find a better job with a better company!!", "I hope you can get it back somehow!", "I'm sure you know that she is so proud of you!  That is really incredible!  Congratulations!", "Were they your favorites?", "That's crazy! I'd leave it on the counter at the store. Hopefully you aren't out much money.", "They're going to remember that forever", "Yeah, that guy sounds like a jerk. Did your insurance cover the dent?", "Oh, Did something happen to him?", "Me neither, but in the end, I really didn't think about him as a dog, he was just my buddy. I hope fond memories of him get you through this.", "At least they made up for it. If they had not I wouldn't use them again.", "I don't even know what team that is, haha. Football is lost on me.", "I took it to the apple store and it actually got fixed in 5 mins, just needed a hardware reset", "I cannot imagine how hard that is on the family and the soldier.  While I can't bring him home quicker, I do want to say thank you to you,  him and your family for your sacrifice.", "Hopefully you had insurance and somewhere to stay.", "Gosh It's worse than I thought it would be.  What did you do?", "Hopefully next time you will get a better score and study more!", "It paid off. Wish I was smart like that", "Is there anyone you could go and visit and maybe stay the night?", "I hope things are better next time.", "Congrats <3", "Did you eventually get it out? I would have been flipping bonkers!", "Oh your right, I have an almost 3 year old and I wouldn't know how to explain it as well! That is so hard sometimes because you don't know what to say!", "I hope you can laugh a little about it now!", "Wow. I am sure you will remember this for a long time. You are going to have to think of a great surprise for him now.", "That's crazy, and a little heart-breaking too. I'm envious of the bond and routine it sounds like you guys had. I have yet to develop a bond like that with a pet. I hope I do at some point", "I'm so sorry :( At least you have your memories to look back on.", "Someone was watching over her.", "Hmm. That's a bit of a strange story.", "Yeah, that is such a silly thing to get a ticket for.", "That's a nice car, you are going to enjoy it.", "That's defiantly a priority! I hope you brought everything that you need. Forgetting something can be a pain", "I bet she was super excited to get it all down.", "What kind of school was she at before?", "We went there a few years back. Had a great time.", "Oh.  Not so good news then :(  I'm sorry.  I'm sure you'll find something!", "You never know if someone is going to slip and spoil it for you, that's true!", "Yeah, thieves are terrible.  I mean, who would steal a mower?", "yea i can see that, it happens but it sucks", "Oh no, no thank you! lol ahhh i cant even.", "I bet.  It's sometimes surprising how much your life revolves around the other person being in the house.", "thats good, you should", "What would you do to them?", "Like a paranormal type fear or a human with intent to harm type fear?", "yeah some people are just naturaly good at video games", "Well it's certainly nice to have someone around with handy knowledge like that!", "I am sure he thinks it's his world, the rules dont apply to him.  Sorry you have to deal with that people can be so rude", "Oh! that is bad then.  Be careful.", "I understand. I guess you'll always feel that way.", "I'm sorry. I know it sucks to need money and be counting on it, and then you don't get it. I hope he pays you back soon.", "Does this happen often? I'd let my neighbor know about it.", "I bet you had tons of catching up to do!", "Interesting... well then at least that leaves the possibility for something good instead. If you're not sure what it could be, then at least it's not some obvious mistake or negligence on your part. I hope for the best for you", "Just spend what time you can with her, I'd like to say something really profound but aging parents is a situation that just sucks. Sorry you are having to deal with it.", "He sounds very nice!", "It's always great to get back positive feedback!", "Thats hilarious, You finally got it though uhuh?", "Oh I see. Hopefully its just that one time where he couldnt get to his phone to let you know.", "Thats so good, man I have done that a time of two.", "Congratulations. You have done great!", "That  sounds like a really awesome car!", "Who did you go see? And are you still friends with all the same people? I wonder if any of them kept their ticket stubs too.", "oh that is awesome. and you got a fancy pen out of it", "That is great. What was the issue with your ear?", "i wish i could unload that fast", "how in the world did it get in your house? were you able to kill it?", "Well you two have fun tonight.

Did you give him a tip?", "Well, don't let this one situation define you. Use it as a learning experience and move on, and do you best not to repeat it.", "Now that is quite embarrassing! What did your co-workers say?", "Awww, what a great idea!  That's so cute! Where are you guys going?", "It's crazy how the tables turn!", "Oh no, were you okay", "That is absolutely unacceptable. Snitches get stitches, that's what I say. Tell me where they're at and I'll roll up on 'em and tell 'em what for. Just say the word. I've got your back.", "i would def feel that way.its hard when you dont know the person or can trust them", "Nice! Did he sign up to be a waterboy?", "What do you plan on doing?", "That must be traumatizing. Most people wouldn't want to go out alone after that. It's understandable.", "I hope you end up getting it!", "Yeah, my favorite is watching short comedy videos of my favorite drag queens", "oh no thats terrible Im sorry to hear that", "You and I both! No matter who wins, let's promise to split the pot.", "Wow, I've never been on a cruise before.

I am sorry to hear that. Maybe you can go find it and sail it to go kill Moby Dick to make up for the damages.", "Oh fun! I'm so excited for you. Try to learn as much as possible from this job and ask for career development opportunities!", "That is FRIGGIN revolting!!! I would have lost my lunch right then and there!", "Don't get it personally. Good performance will always catch other's attention.

People might have more respect if they were forced to clean up other people's trash as well.", "I suppose so. It's great that you value life so much!", "Close call. I once spilt tea over my laptop and the keys were all sticky for a while", "Was she sick?", "Hopefully you'll have better luck next time!", "Maybe you can find another one or go back to your previous company. Have you double checked with the company to make sure everything is ok?", "Good luck! Whenever you get that promotion we should go celebrate", "I always get sad though when they melt", "Of course! Well, at least you also looked human. We all make mistakes.", "I would hate that as well. I hope he learns to cope with it.", "I completely understand that.  My mother in law used to have really bad anxiety about flying, but she did hypnosis and it really helped.", "Yeah. I feel for you.

Talking smack to each other", "Thats awful! People should be arrested for that", "That makes me feel ill so I'm sure you were sick. I hope somehow you make it up!", "That's annoying, maybe they should provide links for you next time?", "That is great.  Interviews are very intimidating.", "There has o be an easier way.  I have always avoided babysitting because I just don't like other peoples kids that much.", "She's must be a keeper then.", "Congratulations!  Did you have a good time?", "aww that stinks, i hope you were at least able to sell them and make some money", "That makes people look bad. I have severe anxiety and still go to work. I get that things are hard but.... its bad to never come in.", "Thats what best friends are for, after all. I hope things have gotten better for you.", "We even had to put something heavy on top of the lid to keep it from getting in it. Hopefully that will work for now until you figure something out.", "I'm sure, that isn't something you see every day, or would even expect to see ever.  I'm glad you got it documented.", "Yeah, that does sound like a conflicting situation. Well at least you're doing something positive.", "Nope, they only know how to touch screens.", "You learn a lot about someone when you move in with them, so if you feel comfortable in your relationship I think that's actually rather prudent.", "Oh gross.  I hope she won't do that again.", "I hope its good that she moved in with you.  things must be serious", "I'm so happy for you, it sounds like it was a wonderful opportunity!", "I know how you feel. I feel guilty about indulging in ice cream the older I get.", "Oh nice.  Those are fun.  I love playing video games", "Oh, that must have been so precious! We had deer around where I used to live - they're gorgeous creatures.", "I love my brother, too. He's a great guy. How lucky we are!", "That is horrible. It sucks that you have to keep such a close eye on your things in front of family. I would be so mad.", "Thats great! What kind of stuff was in the dreams?", "You should be proud of yourself. Keep pushing it and work and it will all pay off.", "I know that feeling. Sometimes they can really get under your skin.", "Sounds like a plan! Make sure to hydrate properly because unpacking is cumbersome work!", "Thats so awesome! Congrats! I am hoping to get there soon.  I have a lot to be thankful for but I know I need to work on just a little bit before I am fully content.", "nice! hope you enjoy your weekend and make sure to make the most out of it!", "well im glad it did not go in the wrong direction", "Well as they say, Better them than you", "that is good hard work and determination will always pay off", "Thats awesome.  Im glad youre happy.  keep the positive energy flowing", "That sounds like sabotage to me. Is there any way to prove you werent there? I would be furious.", "Man that's a bummer.  I'd visit you but that would be weird.", "That is very very cool.  I would love something like that in mine", "Thats great.  I hope you get a raise too", "Wow that's really compassionate of you", "Thats such fantastic goals to aim for in life! I wish you all the best.", "haha that sounds quite messy, but I hope that it atleast tasted good", "Me too, I try not to worry about money so much. There's more to life than that.", "Hard work is supposed to payoff, right?", "If you get sick you won't be able to work at all so please take care of yourself.", "Wow, that's cruel.", "Just keep it up and you will go far.", "HTML/CSS/Java. I'm excited about a career change.", "oh god yes i know what you mean, any ideas what you wanna do ?", "oh that is scary.  I hope you were ok.  make sure your doors are locked", "good luck! we just had our mini cooper blow its engine yesterday .. $12.5k to replace", "He can have a great impact on your brain and feeling that is for sure", "I would have been really mad as well!  Hopefully he learned not to pull that kind of prank on you again!", "Oh, I see. I think I kind of understand. It at least sounds like you're a really self-aware person, and appreciative of the small things, and that you have decent perspective on things. The emotions might be difficult to deal with, but at least there are some positives there for you to take stock of", "im so sorry.  I hope youre ok", "You deserve one. Did you get it?", "I can imagine, at least you got out of the situation safely", "Oh man, well I hope that it was worth it to take out those loans.", "Sounds like a great idea! That would be very nice of you to give a dog a home", "I know the feeling!  My son is a year old so I remember it well haha.", "That's awesome, bet you look straight out of 1990s.", "What do you miss the most?", "that sounds yummy. i'm glad you had that special treat.", "Those things can really fly on the ground.", "Oh hey! If it works out for you have fun", "Knowing roaches, they'd probably survive it, seeing as they can pretty much survive anything!", "That's great!! Hopefully he will do good in school this year and not have to go to summer school again!", "Well I hope that it goes well for you!", "Just have faith in your abilities and the rest will come by itself", "That sounds nice, having someone prepare a meal for you can be fun.", "oh well that sounds pleasant", "How far did you end up running tonight?", "Oh wow! Congrats! That's great!", "It really is why would someone make you feel like it was for girls only especially being young but you are great now.", "Well, on the other hand you can think of this situation, as if you just paid $500 to a person to never bother you again.", "I'm sorry to hear that, he is a brave man.", "well thats not too bad", "What was that moment for you?", "I would imagine. Just own it and wear it like a badge.", "I cannot even imagine", "I always keep some propolis pills with me just in case.", "OH goodness!  Are you ok?", "They must enjoy the rain.", "Well there is at least one positive. Maybe you could try joining some meet up groups to help you acclimate.", "They are but to just be able to continue throughout another day is a great feeling.", "Yes, he is great no wonder his work is so expensive.", "Good luck on the exam!", "Okay, tell me more about that.", "Maybe he can turn it into a career and make a lot of money!", "I know that feeling all too well.  Too much to do and not enough time to do it all, and certain things you can't do until the week of.  Hopefully you will get it all done and then you guys will have a great time!", "That's so tragic I have 3 dogs myself, do you have flyers up?", "Maybe it doesn't fell very comfortable with having you over and doesn't have any other way of expressing itself", "haha I bet.  That's pretty awesome!", "She is going to be great at that job", "I'd be super embarassed, too!", "Yikes, I would definitely stage an intervention with the rest of your family, let him understand it's not okay", "I never had one. I didnt know they were expensive", "That's awesome. How much do you anticpate the raise to be?", "oh thats cool", "a tough situation but at least you were able to realize and adapt!", "How old is she?", "All you can do is make sure she's not in too much pain as she goes.", "ah that was really disrespectful of her though. That's not someone you'd want to date long term.", "That should bode well for her and her future there though, so it was a good surprise!", "That is good, hopefully you find your soulmate.", "Well, I hope nothing bad happened!", "I have for the past 10 years! It's one of my favorite sports to watch.", "good luck. even though you don't need it", "How come he came home early?", "Perhaps I should find the local shelter in my community and do the same. I have never done that before and I feel like I should be giving back to those less fortunate in some capacity.", "That sounds great, you should make him dinner to surprise him back!", "Why didn't you tell them to move?", "Yea. Seeing each other on a screen definitely can't beat being with each other in person.", "Thats good lol", "I am so sorry for you. Perhaps you can hang with her after your workdays?", "You will have a blast.", "Yikes! I would ask for a refund for sure", "Right, but I'd say once isn't too bad as long you stay on track.", "I've moved almost half a dozen times in my life before, so I completely understand. Those were rough times.", "I guess some people are just really rude, no matter what position you put them in", "I am so glad that it didn't turn out bad for you.", "Well he is the one missing out and  i'm sure your very worthy of attention from some better.", "That's still really good! She did better than 25 other people.", "Very nice! I bet its going to be a good happy weekend.", "Why stop at 50? We ought to get 100! We need to show your friend and evil corporate Taco Bell who is boss and nab us some consoles!", "You are good to allow him to borrow the car.", "Ah ok. If you try once you will be alright next time..", "That sounds like a good plan. Perhaps you should request a formal resume from any potential roommates for your future abode.", "That was very rude of her to do that, some people just have no manners.", "That's good, I hope you do well! How did you prepare?", "I see.I bet you and him are happy to be able to spend a little time together.", "Oh, well that is a fine thing indeed! I would be  jumping up and down!", "Ah I see. Staying focused is hard, especially when your lonely.", "It must have been awful to see that in someone you care about. I'm glad she's not giving up.", "You must get a good sleep now to enjoy the New york later", "I will cross mine too! I hope ya'll win it big.", "I am so glad that you are. Now no more driving when your sleepy.", "I would go with the bigfoot option. You can get a costume on the cheap on ebay nowadays. I've used that tactic countless times and it has never failed!", "Christmas is coming early. You will have to take me for a ride.", "Whats kind of exam is that?", "exam's are always scary. we just need to take the mind out of it", "Have you asked them to stop calling about this topic?", "Oh okay. Well hopefully they give you a chance to breathe and decide what you want to do.", "Well I hope it's good! Your mom sounds like a great person to have a fun surprise for you like that.", "That sounds like fate? Being that both of you lived close to each other.", "I am sure with your guidance she will!", "That is great news! fortunately doctors are there to help us and i'm glad they have helped you!", "You made the right move. They at least have to show up with that giant truck that sucks the tank dry.", "That's ok, it happens to us all. Tomorrow is a new day.", "Now that your girlfriend knows the problem,  the both of you can work on solutions and support together.", "I've played laser tag a few times. I think you will have a great time! It's very high paced and noisy but that's half the fun.", "I'm sad to hear that but human nature is hard to fight. Honestly, if you have any alternative options or plans you may have to fall back on them.", "That's a good bright side to look at.", "It's missing a leg so its probably dead unfortunately.", "I hope you get it! Good luck!", "Wow! congrats, you should totally be proud of yourself.", "You guys sound like you have a solid relationship. It's always great to find those little pieces from the early days.", "Good man, I have a lot of respect for that.", "Well I bet you're going to have a great time. With that haul I don't see how you couldn't!", "Oh man!  Do you have a dog?", "Awesome, I'm glad to hear that. Sometimes it's hard to find contractors with good reputation.", "Well, they are expensive and you didn't really miss much.", "Wish i could run close to 5km, i'd struggle with 100 meters.", "That's awesome. I get nostalgic about old games as well.", "That is a really rough story, You should make him pay for another one.", "Did he go to the doctors for help? anyway i'm glad he is OK.", "Oh heck! That had to be really scary for them! glad you're okay though!", "I get that.  It's weird when I forget the name of someone I knew for years.", "Thank god he is ok.  There are very dangerous diets around, better be guided by his doctor.", "That's awesome.  I'm glad he did so well.", "That's so wonderful to hear.", "I bet. I'm not great at being away from my boyfriend.", "What kind of convention?", "Dogs are probably my favorite pet. Maybe I should take up volunteering for a dog shelter one day.", "damn, him and XXXtentacion we're really good.", "I understand. Our puppy sheds a ton too and he isnt even that hairy of a dog", "Sounds like heaven!", "Aww, I'm sorry. Hope that teacher learned a lesson", "Aw, that was so nice! I'd love to find a cat sitter like that!", "It seems like all those years just flew by, huh. At least now he's getting old enough to start remembering all these great times!", "It never ends does it? I hope you keep your head above water though, it's all you got sometimes!", "Sure. I love working out.", "Dang that sounds bad! I know you might be frightened of going but I think you should go. You'll be better off for it.", "That is awesome! I love festivals, they're always great to unwind and even just walk around talking to people.", "I know, fresh bread is a big temptation to me, and what about sweets and desserts, do you have a weakness for those too?", "Oh that's a good friend. I hope your feeling better now.", "Dominoes, IMO, has better prices and better pizza. I dont like all that oil", "Take her out to dinner! That would be a treat.", "Hopefully they were understanding that it was accidental?", "Its always best to be on time , I hope they understand no one is perfect.", "With whatever you decide in life just know that you are a very skilled and intelligent person! Im sure you will find your path in life eventually with time", "OK,  so what is your plan now?", "Yes it can be really helpful! I went to school 3 hours from my home and it was still hard to meet new people", "So sad...that makes me want to cry, too, just hearing about her reaction.", "I bet it's much different than it was back when you lived there.", "Good luck to you! I wish you all the best <3", "Definitely doesn't excuse what they did.", "You are a stand up person!", "Full of what?", "Hopefully you don't get in trouble but I definitely know the feeling.", "You can never be to sure now a days, they might post your secret to social media.", "I always worry when I have to take tests. Unfortunately, I am horrible with tests. I am glad you aced it!", "Word, you should ask him what the secret is", "Yeah Freud called it Projection, it's too bad people tend to hide their true natures so well.", "You can't help him until he wants to really change. Sometimes all you can do is pray.", "It's good to get to spend time with those you love. I am happy for you.", "That's so cool, you seem very intuitive", "Why were you walking so late at night?", "You don't have me yet <3", "that sounds like an adventurous day", "Someone's gotta put an end to that poor service!", "Come clean and fix it. It will make you feel better.", "I like your confidence! Fighting!", "how does this make you feel like?", "That's exciting. How long have you been learning programming?", "oh did he say anything afterwards? what happend next?", "I can't say I have had any mean dogs as of yet.  My favorite breed is  a pitbull.   THey are so loyal  and sweet although  lots of people claim they are mean and vicious .", "thats awesome i hope you have a good time with her", "Oh! So close. Just to think about that missed opportunity.", "Yup, and I feel there's a part of us that is eternal as well", "It seems most responsible to alert someone to clean it.", "Word, college is tough, wishing you the best", "And why do not you try to teach your brother?", "That is good.  Money is no good if you are not healthy enough to enjoy it.", "Did you tell him how creepy he is lol", "Aww yeah, those are great times that you can never really go back to. Sometimes I also wish I could go back in time...maybe you could call her up again and catch up on the last few years!", "Maybe if we weren't so attached to being creatures of comfort. Some things we just can't let go of, wouldn't exist without some poor shmuck having to do the dirty work. I guess we're all that shmuck to someone, someway or another.", "oh wow that sounds very emotional, I think I would have needed a bucket to catch all my tears.", "May be you are right. But sometimes, you go with your heart not with the law. Murphy's law may not work in every situation.", "That is great that she has such a great support group and loving family members to support her. I hope she gets well soon! :)", "Yes there is! Maybe throw in a cupcake too, I am sure she will forgive you in a heart beat! I know I would. :)", "Awesome to hear that you'll get to live with your loved one soon", "Oh no that must have been a terrible experience, I hope no one got hurt from the shattered glass.", "wow. that's awesome! you'll need  that work ethic in nursing school for sure.", "I'm the same way a lot of the time. It's really a good way to avoid any unnecessary disasters.", "That is great, I would also be surprised if she said no to a man like you!", "If telling yourself that makes you feel better, I found all of that to be much more stressful. To be completely honest with you I think people invented stories about the after life to make them more comfortable with death.", "But we got to make the best of it, pretty soon elon musk will release flying cars and then life will be amazing again.", "There will always be people that are jealous of your success, but it is up to you to be the bigger person and handle it with grace.", "I am sorry to hear that, I would have felt the same way.", "I'm sure they will be great to him and he'll bring them joy as well!", "OH man! Yeah I would of felt the same way!", "That is great, I believe that you will do amazing!", "Oh I see, well good luck to you, I hope you'll solve it soon.", "That is good, sometimes that is all you really need to do, get things done  one step at a time :)", "If it makes you happy then you should do it! Capitalize on that nostalgic feeling while you can.", "Wow, some people are just terrible! I hate when people don't take responsibility for their actions.", "Oh no. What do you think caused him to do that?", "Eww that sounds horrible! Were you able to get a refund at least?", "You've really got to be committed to go into work like that. It's not for everybody, I agree.", "I get it. There is always another meal to start making the change!", "Don't let it worry you too much. Just make sure you organize everything you need to present and remember to speak loudly and clearly! You can do it!", "I definitely recommend getting some mace and a pocket knife. Stay safe out there!", "I am sure the procedure will go excellently.", "That's awesome! Maybe she'll come out of her shell.", "It sounds incredible! Hopefully it helped you conquer your fear!", "You're going to kill it this semester! You're going to be so proud when you're walking down the aisle to get handed your degree.", "It's amazing how many feelings and memories mementos like that can bring back.", "I think it will be fine. I bet the new car runs well.", "Im sure your not though!", "yeah it unfortunate we have to worry about things like this.", "That's unfortunate. I wish we could fly sometimes.", "That is a brilliant idea.  There is nothing better than catching up with old friends.", "The love and care you show him will bring him joy and happiness!", "That sounds like a good decision. Good luck!", "That's awesome! I'm very excited for you this is a good event for you!", "That's bad news. I hope that everyone is healthy and doing well.", "Oh sounds scary!  I would have been scared.", "That's probably a good idea.", "Wow that is a long time! Hopefully you can stay in touch with all of your former coworkers.", "am so sorry about that, did he apologize?", "Please try to be kinder to yourself! You are a great person- with a lot to offer. Always remember to be good to yourself.", "My husband is my most trusted companion.", "How frustrating! Keep your head held high and be strong. One day you'll be able to keep him from taking your money.", "Haha, well I do know the feeling. I guess if it works for you, then don't change anything.", "well im sure you'll get over it. nobody should make fun of our mothers", "it's all gonna be fine and you'll get what u want.", "That really does make it special. I'm glad you have that.", "oh man, that's rough to hear from someone older than you. is she ok?", "Other people deserve to have things, too.", "Awww, well it happens to everyone sometimes. Just try to forget it.", "i love walking in nature. hiking is a great way to exercise and to explore the outdoors", "I know. It is hard to say goodbye to people but he is doing a wonderful thing at least.", "If there is something in particular, try to deal with it head on.", "great day to you too", "You sound very confident! I wish I had your confidence when I was in school.", "That's a great field. My daughter just got a degree in art but she hasn't been able to find a job yet. Good luck tomorrow!", "Don't get too cocky but enjoy your victory you deserve it.", "Please try not to be so hard on yourself! We all make mistakes.", "Oh that's terrible. Did they take care of it?", "Right.", "One day she'll look back and it will mean so much to her! Memories with parents are the best ones.", "Agreed, a good theme park is nice because you know they have high safety standards, but those carnival ones scare the crap out of me.", "I'm so sorry to hear that. Hopefully he has a good team of doctors that figure out what is going on. Are y'all able to visit him?", "I'm so glad you came out of it okay.  I hate driving in bad weather and reckless driving just makes it worse.", "It's totally understandable. Life can get really busy sometimes!", "I'm sorry to hear that. I hope that everything works out for you.", "Oh then yeah, invest in a trainer. I love dogs a lot but an aggressive dog is very dangerous.", "I would definitely make digital copies and upload to a cloud or a disk in case something happens.", "Nice choice!  Getting a B is definitely something to celebrate", "I agree 100%.  Sounds like it's time to start downloading some new tunes to test out!", "I really hope she gets better too, it must be terrible to know you cant have any kids. You're a good man for helping her cope.", "I know right? I wish I was young again sometimes.", "You just have to remember what a good life she had with you!", "That's good! I've always heard that people are closer friends to each other in a small town.", "Is there anything she does specifically for her?", "Oh, okay. Maybe you should ask your teacher for some extra help or find a study buddy. i hope you do better next time.", "That's great! We've been married for almost 10 years and I still feel like a newlywed. It's great when you marry your best friend.", "Oh, well that was a smart thing to do. I would've bailed. lol", "I'm right there with you. It makes you shed a tear sometimes too.", "Yeah, I think that means you have a conscience, which is a good thing. If you didn't feel bad, I'd worry about you!", "Yes, they are. He is my daughter's best friend. She can do whatever she wants and he is unphased.", "My mistake :)", "I don't know what I would do without my dog.  I'm glad you have one that's always there for you!", "Mmmm. that sounds really good! I'm thinking biscuit and sausage gravy, hash brown and eggs...", "I think they will get over it. Most people understood that not everyone is going to remember every little thing.", "Shocking! Has your kid done that before?", "Your welcome! Glad I could help!", "You'll return to self-sufficiency soon, you just can't let yourself fall into a pit of self doubt. Stay confident.", "That's a really tough decision either way. I wish you the best with it and hope everything improves", "Keep up the good work!", "Thanks that is quite the offer. How kind.", "Yeah you might want to look into it then", "Yes, google has a lot of great information for pet care.", "You're welcome. Be careful not to chase stocks too hard, they don't always turn the way you might hope!", "Dogs gonna do dog stuff. That's just how they do.", "Yeah it is better to be safe than sorry", "I'm sorry that happened. You might need to get her obedience training,", "lol maybe yall could find something to bond over", "Yeah we all do but we can only go forward", "You might want to look up what is going on online", "I'm sure it's not so bad. At least you can laugh about it now!", "that is good! I hope you enjoy yourself", "Congrats! I hope it goes well. Are you presenting to a board of directors?", "Man that gets to me when someone does that , like they are better than everyone else.", "I understand what you mean.  I hope you and your family are all able to get together and enjoy each other's company soon.", "well have you practiced interviewing? With that you can feel so much better!", "Keep working hard and I think your efforts will eventually be noticed.", "Well it isn't as if she did it on purpose dogs always have a reason.", "Yeah, I know what you mean it does sound very scary, but they do numb your face and usually they do not pull it out, they fill in the cavity!", "That's good, sometimes it's good to just be lazy inside the house.", "don't worry about it you will get it done and he will be proud of it", "Have you always had a fear of flying?  I haven't ever really feared it, but I don't like it.", "Ohh okay I see, yeah I always get excited when new things happen at work too.", "Did you hide the wrappers?", "I don't think I have ever seen that kind in the store, I'll have to look for it next time I go. I don't care much for the runny yogurt, but I like greek yogurt so long as it's whole fat and sweet.", "No cat or dog?", "I'm sorry that happened to you and I will take your advice.", "Oh wow, it's fortunate that you managed to get out of that situation alive. I'm glad you made it out of that awful situation.", "Did you give him any?", "Ugh, that sounds wonderful, I would do the same if I were stressed I think", "That must take a lot of practice. I can't even juggle safe objects so I'd likely lose an arm if I tried to juggle chainsaws lol", "I think it's the feeling of the beginning of something new.", "Wow that is fantastic, she is so lucky to have you around because you are such a sweet and caring person. :)", "That does sound like a really fun job. I also work freelance and would also like something more stable.", "Oh no that sucks, I am sorry that you had to stay home alone. What did you do to entertain yourself?", "Yes, I am sure that your cat is in a better place. If you ever want to talk to someone about it I am always here to listen. :)", "Ahh. Still, another stone set on the road to payoff. I wish you the best!", "Oh no, I bet you aced this one then.", "Aww man, that sucks, I am guessing that you end up having to do all the dirty work because he has been slacking off.", "Guessing he didn't get anymore food for dinner lol.", "Mmhm. I wish I studied more, paid more attention, and joined more clubs. But I guess that's the thing, you're already as busy as it gets, and unfortunately you can't experience it all.", "Yeah I bet! You will do great, I have high hopes in you! :)", "That sounds really disappointing. Hopefully, you'll be able to see them soon! I'm sure they were excited too.", "Wow they must have had 1 too many drinks if they could not even get to the bathroom. I am sorry you had to see such a disgusting sight", "Right, no one truly knows until they get there, so scary.", "I'm glad you were happy reading the book.", "I imagine it was a big college. what did happen at the end?", "I saw a machine one time that you could win live lobsters. They would cook it for you if you won.", "Man, I hope you two do something fun!", "Thats fair I guess, weird fish freak me out more then spiders through", "Aww man that sucks, One day your hard work will pay off, so don't let it get to you too much. I am sure she is not intentially doing that", "Well done. I hope you dont find anymore, they are scary.", "What prompted his back flip?", "I hope they were pretty understanding.", "Adding mac sauce to a cheeseburger is a game changer", "You got this! I believe in you!", "You should stop being their friend!", "I would just keep to myself.", "Well I think as long as you say sorry, she can forgive.", "Maybe there was something outside or maybe he just wanted attention.   Dogs behavior can be hard to figure out sometimes.   Good Luck!", "I hope you threw out those pants.", "Aww! I wish I had a dog now!", "Okay. I'm not really a fan of it.", "Does it make you feel like you're living in an alternate reality?", "That is a good way. I have a dog that makes me feel safe. Do you have anything like that?", "It depends on your preference. I watch korean dramas.", "When the sun is shining walking and seeing the beautiful sights makes me smile.", "my best friend is my boyfriend. So I share everything with him", "That is so generous of you! have you ever thought of joining a volunteer organization?", "??? is it a cancer of some sort??", "I think it would be fun to help someone build a house.", "well how did it go? did you do well?", "Yes, they do. And lots of care.", "I agree, they are the best.", "Small things like what?", "Well i mean sounds like favortism to me. Siblings always get the better things", "I do not play too much because if I do not win, I feel it is a waste of money.", "do you have a good teacher?", "That is okay, mistakes happen all the time.", "I see, that is such a nice way to remember your past,.", "Well I guess you might want to study harder next time.", "that's why I do it, for a great cardio workout. so what were the results?", "and then what happened", "yeah you are. what show was it?", "That is a good one! it is not always broken though. Sometimes they are out of ice cream mix because the workers eat it all", "Oh that is a bad place to go", "Aww that's so sweet <3", "That is good safety first", "That is cute! is there a meaning behind that name?", "I'm rooting for you! Get your dream person!", "The writing is very clear on the wall. You have been ignored.", "Well I hope you won't have any of those mean teachers! Maybe you'll have some awesome ones?", "you didn't talk to any of them during summer break? is there anyone specific you're looking forward to see?", "Uncertainty is the only certainty!", "Well that is a good way of doing things as long are you getting the job right in my opinion.", "Your hard work will not fail you", "Well, at least you came out without an injury? Or did you.", "Not surprising. How long did it take you before you were able to eat a burger again?", "so I hear....", "I'm glad to hear he has moved on with his life! A huge step forward.", "Oooo you have to be sneaky with your meat habits, my friend", "You are a good example to others.", "Loyal and caring. You've got a winner on your hands!", "what if it all comes crashing down on you!", "How have you managed it? Have you thought about returning to the store and admitting to it?", "Oh wow, well there is always another chance, we all learn on mistakes.", "You need to save your money to be able to afford it.", "Not for naught but, a dog won't ever betray you <3", "maybe this time you can do it somewhere alone?", "Well I hope things turn out better for you", "oh I see. what do you want to do instead?", "That's good. You guys are siblings after all and should try to get along.", "fair enough my friend, would you say your chances are high because of signs of other people winning around you recently?", "Hopefully you don't live too far. I know this is a random chat but, I genuinely hope your father is okay. I don't have a dad so, cherish every moment you get.", "I will have a look at it on my lunch break today! I did snorkelling in the Philippines at it was amazing.  That was on the island of Coron", "Thank goodness. You really dodged a bullet on that one", "well, I don't want to break it to you, but those guys are fictional....", "I can understand that feeling. Well, if it was pretty innocuous there's no harm and keeping confidentialiy", "Sweet! Sounds like a good job. How are the bosses?", "very nice its always good to find a faithful and loving woman", "it's good that you learned from your mistake!", "Aw, that's great to hear about happy marriages! I hope you tell her often how much you appreciate her!  I'm sure you're a great husband too.", "How old was he?", "Totally. I can't imagine losing my job. Luckily the economy is pretty good, so maybe they will find new jobs quickly.", "I would feel emotional too with such a big transition in life. I am sure you will enjoy university though", "that makes sense why you got upset but in the end we're all gonna follow them and you never now you may see them again", "It's true they grow up so fast. This is why we should appreciate every second we have with them.", "Oh wow- Do you have a college degree?", "So what are you planning to do", "I understand that all too well! I'm glad it wasn't too bad though. I've had some pretty embarrassing things happen while hungover.", "i'm glad it made you more aware of what you're doing.", "Keep your head up high, good positive thinking.", "You are such a sweet soul. They say adopt and rescue ,don't buy", "I hope he had a wonderful wedding. He must have been proud of you.", "You must be really proud of yourself. That sounds really fulfilling!", "of course you won't, have an amazing summer!", "Its fair that way", "Oh gosh, all you can do is try to be there for her.  But yes, 14 is so young to be a mother. I'd be very upset too. I'm sorry.", "It's a great thing these companies are doing letting you re-live the good old days when you're older!", "I hate it when that happens! I hope you didn't hurt yourself, and that somebody tried to help?", "Congratulations on a new job", "I can understand that. I think the next company you apply for will be your time to shine!", "Ha, that's good! Mine haven't gotten sick from it either. I just hate to waste food!", "That's cool - I never had the concentration to study that much", "I don't blame you. I've never seen one before, I'd hate to see one.", "Well try to stay out of trouble now you are a bit older!", "that's great, i'm glad she's nice to you.", "I am so happy for you. You should get a nice dinner with your family.", "thats good you told him. Thats a lot to keep inside. Hopefully he wasnt mad", "Oh no, sorry about that. But have you confessed to her", "that's good that you put a lot of effort into it", "That's really embarassing! did any of your friends poke fun at you for it?", "At least you got your moneys worth! Are you going to have it installed?", "Memories are good to be kept in the medulla. Good old days. You really had a good time", "I bet it was really special though! Christmas is such a beautiful time of year. When are you getting married?", "It's good that you're faithful. Too bad your boyfriend couldn't be less flirtatious and respect you more.", "Surf and turf! That's what they called a steak served with seafood. It's very yummy!", "That's always a good feeling.", "oh no, you are a good dog owner though", "Oh that is great! Congratulations on your knew home! That must be so exciting!", "My kids would love something like that", "Bye! Watch out for those monkeys!", "yeah pop that champagne!", "What kinds of fruit do they have there?", "That's awesome. Do you own a horse now?", "True. There has to be a work/school/life balance.", "You should keep an eye on him older people are more prone to getting sick.", "Lol it happens, what's important is that you learned and care enough about your people to internalize the knowledge.", "What were your favorite games?", "Well good riddance. If you never want to see scum again, just loan them $20.", "Well that's good news. I hope you do better on your next test.", "That's good that you are keeping your options open and even better that you challenged yourself to leave comfort and travel.", "Kids can be so mean. Thank God that's all behind us now!", "I'm glad I never had to live with other people. I would not be as patient as you.", "Absolutely. Great job!", "Yeah, and it can be cost effective if you plan wisely!", "Whew! You are lucky! Glad to hear everyone was ok.", "Don't beat yourself up over it, it was a very tragic accident but who could've known. He's in a better place now.", "Yeah I thought of that. well, the kids probably loved it!", "Are they all Yeezys?", "Yeah, that's not too bad at all!  Sounds idyllic!", "Yes I remember the freedom that comes with the first car.", "Yes, that would certainly give them a taste of their own medicine!", "I've tried a few, and I would have to say the one that I liked the most was Weight Watchers. It's pretty easy to stay on, and the food is usually good. The only big problem is that it gets expensive.", "Time to go shoppin lol!", "Glad you are doing better!", "I see, I think you may consider a tylenol or some type of sleep pill for the flight, to ensure that you don't feel uncomfortable or paranoid during travel.", "Amen. Mine was a good man. He taught me a lot of good life lessons.", "I'm glad you have something that helps keep his memory alive. :)", "Well that's a good attitude to have. I don't blame you for being mad. I would be.", "That's awesome!! I love jeeps!  congratulations, that's great news!", "Aww, I'd love to see a video of that.", "Good thing you listened to your gut feeling", "Well that is what they get paid for. Just be sure to tip him well.", "Yeah, I'm glad you didn't do anything you would regret. I hope he is better for you in the future.", "That sounds like a good plan. You definitely don't want that to happen again. Sometimes bad things happen in order for us to learn and avoid it again.", "Wow, that's impressive! I'm glad he had a good time.", "I bet he did, I'm glad he's okay though.", "I'm sure he doesn't expect it but thats a really nice thing he did.", "It would be terrible in the winter.  I cant imagine sleeping outside when its freezing", "Mmmmm, I love greek food! That sounds appetizing! I think I will take my girl there too this week!", "I'm sorry. You could seek out a professional to talk to. Or you could just try meeting some new people.", "oh wow! you did say a ton! I love animals too. wish I lived somewhere I could have more.", "That's pretty impressive.", "Usually, you are the one who notices it the most.", "very cool, wish i could get into something like that. sounds fun", "Maybe also looking into getting a new dog, I know it's hard, but you can get through it! Your friends and family are always there as well.", "Haha, that is true. But we have to make the most of this one.", "you dont still have any feelings at all for her?", "Omg, that would be awesome. I might just have to learn how to do that myself.", "Yay! That sounds like so much fun. Baby showers are a great way to bring everyone together.", "It is, everything has to be balanced just right, or else we feel it.", "That is good, such an embarrassing situation to be in.", "thats not bad. I have a rx 280", "That's good, glad he wasn't having too tough a time.", "That can make it so hard to sleep at night.", "Haha, clearly strawberry. Sounds like you had an enjoyable childhood!", "If it were me, I'd call the animal shelter and report possible abuse since the dog does nothing but bark all day - poor thing just needs attention and the owner isn't taking care of it.", "Agreed!", "I guess it all comes down to karma, if you believe in that stuff...... I do. :)", "It's good to have a partner.", "You must have been very happy when they returned home.", "That's disappointing. I feel sorry for you.", "Yeah, but it is a good thing to hear you did not lose too much. Some people put all the money on the line.", "Well I hope you do. What kind of job is it?", "That's awesome! I'm glad it went through without a hitch!", "Oh, I love that you are so happy for her! You sound like such a supportive and loving partner!", "Puppies are smart believe it or not, use treats and don't yell or punish for their mistakes. A change of tone and placing them outside works really well.", "i agree, the toys now days are made cheaply and of poor quality. everything is about video games.", "It's like christmas! only you already know whats in the boxes. the best part about moving is you can have a fresh start on organization.", "I bet that worked!", "I bet, hope the dog is feeling better though.", "oh man, that is an issue, i hope he grows out of it", "Miami sounds like a great place to go for a vacation.   I wish I was going with you!", "It sounds like a very challenging environment to work in.", "Does she live far away?", "Hopefully you'll able to get it all sorted out soon.  I'm sure when it's done it'll be a beautiful house.", "I've never tried VR, but just imagining that is scaring me away from it.", "That's a long time to hold out hope.  I bet you were shocked.", "I bet so too!  Good luck to you both.", "Nice choice. I guess you have good relationship with your brother.", "wow, that's unfortunate. i would feel embarrassed for the lady", "It is an amazing thing to have a loving mother. Everyone should show more appreciation to their moms.", "good enough you got home safe", "Yes. Nostalgia is unavoidable when we look back on our youth.", "No need to feel ashamed. We all make mistakes and at least you learned your lesson.", "Yes, it really does. I am sure if you get sick, he will remember and do the same for you!", "That's good news at least. I hope you are feeling better now. And don't be hard on yourself, accidents happen.", "You'll get used to it and begin to appreciate your quiet time, haha.", "Do you think he was panhandling you for money or a person who really needed it? Did you give him money?", "I bet It will teach you.", "The people you can meet are super.", "That is really not thing. I wish more people would do such nice thing. I know that made your day.", "That was really nice of your old friends.", "Nice. What brand of shoes were they?", "I'm glad he was able to catch him.", "Aww, that is so sad to hear. He must have made some great movies!", "Awww! Twins seem like a handful but also very exciting at the same time!", "I can imagine that you did want to run and hide. Sometimes husbands get us into all kinds of situations.", "Well that's all that matters. If she was okay with it. I'm sure she was happy watching the episodes with you, even if you had already watched them.", "That's what's most important. I'm glad everything has gone well.", "Oh, that's too bad. I know exactly how you feel. Hopefully your husband will watch your son another night so you can go have some fun.", "It's ok, just try your best to remind yourself how beautiful you are and practice self-care as a habit.", "She sounds like a great companion.", "Exciting! I'm sure you'll do fine.", "Wow, that's no good. I hope they get it worked out soon.", "That would keep me up at night.", "I've been there before too. The important thing to remember is that there is always another chance to make it right tomorrow.", "Yeah, sounds like a pretty smart pup.", "That is awesome. I am proud of him", "i feel ya but sometimes temptation is good gets the heart pumping", "You know they say, imagine them in their underwear...I wonder that really works. I'm not fond of public speaking either.", "I wouldnt get discouraged.  Maybe talk to your boss and see what you can improve on next time.  I'm sure, at least if you have a good boss, they will want you to succeed and guide you in how to do better.", "Yeah, but they are all just a phone call away. Keep your head up, your girlfriend will be there soon!", "It reminds you of how beautiful life is.", "Yeah, some nerve on that guy. He should be grateful to have a job!", "You are so awesome!!! I wish I had  sister like you when I was pregnant.", "I'm glad it worked out in the end!  I wish people would be more careful with their dogs.", "The store might not take it back at this point if it has been to long.", "I'm sorry! What a lovely memory to have of her though. It's good to still have things in your life that remind you of her.", "I understand completely. I have things of my grandfather's that I can never replace.", "That would be awesome to have the whole lake to yourself! My guess is the weather was nice too if you guys got to use the boat most days!", "Have you ever had a positive experience from that cycle?", "Good to read. Always great to find a vet you can trust. Looks like you did.", "Well that's kind of disappointing. It's always a let down when you go out and it isn't is good as you were hoping.", "lol. it kinda is. i moved about 3 hours south of my office a few years ago and since even at the office my work involves connecting to remote data centers it hasn't changed my job any.", "That's good. I'm glad your alright.", "Hopefully you didn't and hopefully the other kids didn't make fun of you", "Oh I bet! My husband wants an older car when we can afford it", "I am so sorry. I am sure you are. I would be devastated if I was in your shoes. Does she have a chip? Maybe someone will get her to a vet office.", "That is a good feeling. Time to celebrate before the grind starts all over!", "That sounds scary! I always avoid going to the dentist until I absolutely have to. I know that's pretty bad!", "Ugh, that's the worst. That happens a lot with my son as well. Hopefully he wasn't too cranky today!", "College is when the tear will start to flow. I love children.", "I saw the weather forecast. We only have a 20% chance of rain so you know how it is here. We'll be good.", "Yes he needs to so you would have to ignore him at nights.", "I can just imagine she sleeps in your bed sometimes. I love dogs, I would like to have a dog someday.", "That was very smart of him, maybe he remembers back to his puppy days.", "That's great news! It sounds like he is enjoying his new freedom, and was ready for it.", "I live out in a rural area where people don't always have control of their dogs.  Sometimes those little ankle-biting dogs will start chasing the car and they make a break for the car and it makes one really fearful that you'll hit them.", "yeah, might wanna go replace it", "Those are the best. Especially the white sand crystal clear water beaches.", "really, i wouldve never thought that. i have a friend who is in Dubai on a teaching assignment", "lol right, they could easily be your neighbors dinner", "I'm sure she can with all the technology and modern medicine now. She's got this!!", "i would like a new life. i totally understand", "wow, a hard lesson", "Yes.  The only company available out here is Century Link and they just crash randomly all the time.", "What interesting stories you must have! I think that would be really neat, but settling down is probably good too.", "yes.  they do like to have lots of  babies", "Yes, my friends are coming with me. :)", "I have never heard of Mr. Robot actually.", "I hope these feelings last for you!", "I don't know that I would be able to give it up.  4 is a lot, but what's one more?", "Everyone gets jealous, It when you act on unfounded stuff that is the issue.", "Yes.  Especially men who want to mansplain things to you.", "That is awesome that he gave it away!  Maybe good karma will let him win again.", "HAHA! You are super lucky you are smart. Lol", "I go to a psychiatrist and take meds, It just fixes what your body doesn't make, or do properly. It helps so much.", "Sometimes you need those times to make your realize how special having a job is. Gives you perspective.", "Im happy to hear that, a sick child is always a scary thing.", "Sounds exciting. Have fun.", "Ha ha, I don't blame you! Hopefully you can get the car you want soon though.", "I 'm glad you was able to pin point the problem and I hope he stays in good health.", "That's embarrasing. But hey, I think the best way to get over moments like those is to just laugh at yourself! Don't beat yourself up for it.", "I understand but try not to be jealous. Good things will come to you to in its own time", "Things like that make me antsy.", "I bet you looked great! Those compliments would've made me feel good too!", "Haha! Well, as we mature, we learn so much more about ourselves.", "Oh my gosh! I'm sorry! haha Thats funny. Atleast you have them a story to always remember.;)", "That's nice of your neighbor! Your boyfriend should've told you that there was no toothpaste earlier. Maybe there would've been time to get some. But at least you didn't go to work with stinky breath, right?", "Hahaha thats funny. I hope you guys are still on good terms. To be honest little holes sounds like an easy fix.", "That's too bad. Well, at least you have something to work towards and plan as a goal for yourself.", "Wow, that must've been a big thing for both of you.", "O ok I hope that everything works out for you", "That's amazing! He probably loves you so much", "I did the same thing today, so you are not alone in your behavior friend!", "Oh, that really stinks. I hope you were able to get another one.", "Oh yea that sounds like you did a good job!", "Yeah i understand, it is good that you took him there though", "sounds wasteful to me. life isnt about material things anyway.", "well maybe you guys should talk", "Ick. Hopefully the smell is fully gone now", "Maybe.  For me I just don't want to cause a stranger to be embarassed lol", "I feel that, I hate being hot. In the winter I can be comfy and I can always just put on a jacket if I get too cold, but in the summer it is not that easy.", "Did you pass the test?", "I think cities are more expensive, like living costs, so I do not want to live there ether personally", "Oh, I understand. Did it bring it to you at all?", "It sounds like you really deserve it!", "at least your ok, thank god for that", "That's pretty great, you must really take the initiative.  Good job", "I think, maybe, yeah! It depends on who's there, and if I felt comfortable with the host. If I felt like I had enough people to kind of rescue me and who I could talk to at the party if I got anxious and couldn't talk to strangers, then that'd be alright. Other than that, I just kind of do like maybe a group of 4, max", "Maybe you could save up and purchase her a new one.", "Yes, we can always count on Him to know the bigger picture and have faith that He's working for our good.  Hope you have a blessed day!", "Those were awesome! My favorite was the coke commercial at Christmas time. So many memories!", "I think I saw someone post a picture of those online. Maybe it was a lunar moth! What a fun experience!", "That's amazing, was it your sisters first baby?", "That sounds so great!   I hope your plants grow beautifully!", "I am so glad!  You know what to do to help your body and mind and that is good self-care.  I try to do that as well as meditate and pray in the morning.  Really refocuses me.  I'm glad you're feeling better!", "Oh yes, last year with huracan Irma we went without power for 5 days.", "That's awesome. Sometimes I wish I could be back in my childhood. Maybe if only for a day. ha ha.", "I would call them. They usually give you some credit for that.", "Good luck! You will do great!", "Yeah, she knew what you meant. She probably forgot in two minutes, while you've thought about it for much longer. The best thing to do there is to just show off your sense of humor and ability to make fun of yourself and not take yourself too seriously, which it sounds like maybe you did.", "You should probably avoid feeding them if you want a clean house.", "Absolutely first. Especially when you don't live close.", "I am glad you had a nice experience! Its difficult to find such a company that cares about its customers!", "I thought it would be normal. Good thing to be cautious.", "That is a good lesson to learn early, I am glad everything turned out okay for you!", "I admire you!  I don't think you'll regret getting this experience", "Haha did they believe it?", "i really enjoy video games as well", "You might try contacting the authorities, though I don't know if it would help.", "did he enjoy the toys>", "That is good! Are you guys close now>", "My mom is one so i know how important you guys are.", "Wow thats awesome! i never win anything like that", "For sure you are born with those types of talents!", "I used to watch the Wonder Years after school. I love watching it until this very day.", "that is good to hear, it was a motivation to succeed, a great character building", "How big was it?", "Yes but death comes to all of us someday. So I think its best we enjoy our life whilst we are blessed with it.", "It is such a blessing to have good friends on whom you can depend.", "That's all you can do, but if you worked hard, I'm sure you will get it!", "Well that's nice. I am glad they were happy memories for you.", "That's odd.  I would've told him so and asked for my money back.", "Oh man, your making it even worse.  I never even thought about that.  Now I want to throw up.", "yeah i can understand that!! id want to get it over with too. the sooner the better", "Maybe you should ask for overtime pay just in case you do get more work!", "Hopefully it isn't a long flight.", "its hard to find good people you can trust with your kids nowadays", "Oh Gosh that is horrible. I am so sorry that happened to you.", "Yeah, I'm not quite a hoarder or a packrat when it comes to those things, but I do get sentimental with some physical objects. If I lost them, I'd feel like it would be an itch I couldn't scratch, because I couldn't replace what I lost. Hopefully you can work past it somehow.", "It's such a wonderful feeling, I should take a shower soon too.", "I hope you can have better self-control in the future.", "how long has it been seen youve seen each other?", "Hahahaa good point. Maybe try hiding your groceries.", "thats great, happy for yo", "must be nice to have someone that loves you", "You can do better next time I believe in you!", "Oh I see.  Very interesting that your faith makes you want to die though.", "once you figure the way it just becomes routine", "That is cool, have you studied any philosophy in school?", "I wish people understood how precious life really is.", "Sometimes I lose my temper like that too.", "ah yes league, love hate relationship with that game but after 4 years it can really still tilt me more and more", "Sorry to hear that, were they understanding about it?", "That sounds quite delicious if I must say.", "Yeah same here.  I remember one time awhile back I took some pictures of when the aliens landed in my backyard.   That was some good times!", "Yes but the market is quite flooded with CS degree holders. It's hard to get something unless you are specialized I think. Unfortunately I don't see society changing any time soon.", "I live every day like it's my last.", "I hope you got your classes.", "I agree that it is as well. In most situations, it can work to one's benefit.", "Why would they want to do that?", "I hope it was worth visiting.", "I would love to come with you to yours. LOL, I just invited myself.", "Are you looking for a new job?", "I can understand. Maybe connect with some like-minded people online?", "He seems like a good friend.", "I am curious for what the future holds.", "If you can and have time, I'd try to get a quick replacement and explain to her. Maybe she'll understand.", "Oh that's easy peasy.  Sometimes I only have to wipe once when I go number 2.", "I think your boss should give you more recognition in that case!", "I agree!", "yeah defiantly, my best advice to you is to learn and focus on your studying and always expand in knowledge that's the one thing we seniors always wish we had done", "really? was it about something very stupid?", "Definitely. I feel the same speaking foreign languages. It's more of a self-conscious thing.", "that sounds like a good time. not the usual country you see people vacation to", "I think you have the perfect outlook. I hope I can strive to maintain something like that as well.", "this is absolutely the worst! he is no man in my eyes!", "that's rough! My husband always did with the kids when he was home.", "don't be, i am sure your fiance will always be right next to you and help you out", "That'd be a good idea, we could all start biking.", "You must be an expert on nutrition then!", "Which country? that sounds fun, are you guys doing anything fun there?", "yes. hopefully all will go well", "I hope he does, being the best man is an honour and you're ready for it.", "oh dang i never really dabbled that deep when i did my small share of programming", "I hope all goes well so you're as happy as possible.", "Yes, it's great when you run into an old friend you haven't saw for a long time.", "That sounds so admirable, I'd love to see you grow to an amazing person.", "oh god i get you! waiting for your food to arrive is real torture.", "that must have startled you", "I don't think I've ever had a delivery guy be that late. I'd be mad.", "It is, I wished they could just use the toilet like we do!", "that does have to feel really good", "I love Colorado. I visit all the time.", "I agree. There is a lot of suffering.  I am glad people like you and I recognize that.", "I understand. Good luck.", "Haha! That's usually the case. : )", "It is always cool to have family and friends close by.", "Why do cities make you feel that way?", "You could grab it when shes done with it and fill it up real quick for her!", "Yeah, that is a hard one to deal with.  Maybe you should give it back so you will not feel bad about yourself.", "Kinda makes you think even more since its such a good deal that people are just like get rid of it - deff look into it!", "Therapy is a good thing. Its is nothing to be ashamed of.", "It's hard to trust anything, even the oatmeal recently was put on the news that its high in cancer causing pest spray.", "Sounds like it went well!", "I just ignore them. At some point, they stop but they understand that it is not working.", "It is. Taking care of sick child is hard. Missing work is also hard. The things we have to do for our children.", "I bet they were lol atleast you can laugh about it now.", "I can certainly understand your feelings, I hope he can somehow fix his habits.", "Oh yeah I remember those old Halo days too during my childhood, such a great game.", "That's cool that you know what you want from life right now and that you don't feel obligated to do things just because of norms.", "Do you kind of feel like there's no where else to go?", "That is great accomplishment! I wish you well on your new path in life!", "Since you didn't hurt yourself I think I will have to laugh. It sounds like it was funny.", "Heck no.  Be envious that they were lucky enough to have their parents hand down all their money to them.", "I'll bet it is! Best of luck with your new truck!", "How big a bird was this. I dont remember anything from the 6th grade.", "haha right! Maybe you should buy a few and see what happens. You cant win if you don't play", "I hate to hear that. It is so hard to lose a pet. I hope you are doing okay through this.", "Well if it is a bigger plane it isnt as bad. Just bring some headphones and listen to some comforting music.", "I am so sorry to hear, I am glad that it didn't cause a lasting effect.", "Keep riding that confidence. It will get you places. It sounds like you deserve it.", "You cannot be too careful these days, i am so sorry that happened to you.", "I hope so too. Thank you so much!", "I would move out of that room. Maybe you need to spray the area.", "That sounds like it was a lot of fun!", "Yeah i would get a pet", "The cat didn't like you, oh dear. I am so sorry that happened. You need to spend more time with the cat.", "Well you could always work out and turn it into muscle", "What kind of dog is he", "At least no one else was injured, but it is sad about the cow.", "It will be okay", "That is a nice job I am sure", "That is good that you gave it back and were able to admit your mistake.

It okay to cry lol", "Our pets are our family...it's not easy to see them suffer..I feel for you. And thank you about our dog.", "That is terrible, you must have been devastated,  I hope he find the help he/she needs.", "He needs to just sing in the shower.

The anticipation must have been killing you!", "Wow!  That is such a great feeling!  I love when good memories come back to me!", "o no im not sure that was the best response", "I bet that was a little embarrassing.", "That's understandable. I wish you the best in staying smoke free!", "I am sure that things will continue to go smooth since you have a positive attitude about it.", "Oh well congrats and good job!", "Yeah I can understand that. I would feel the same.", "Well, you never know if you can do something till you try. I am glad you were able to do so well.", "Awesome, congratulations!

I wonder what he is thinking.", "That sounds great, That is how I like my houses to be too.", "Oh I hadn't even thought of avocado. Well good luck with the diet, I hope it works for you!", "Awe that is great! I am glad there was a happy ending!", "Yup gotta lay down the law", "Oh good. I bet!  I wouldn't have been able to go back to sleep after that!  Do you have to replace the pump?", "That was really nice of you to apologize like that. Some people would have just ignored it. I know that could have been embarrassing.", "Doesn't sound corny. We all need a hobby to relieve stress!", "Awww, well maybe you'll have grandchildren that you can take one day!", "Congratulations! That's great news. Well deserved", "Right, I had to end up calling the homeowners association on them", "That is incredible.

I hope he get it.", "I understand, when it comes to our kids and being worried about them it feels like time stand still", "Were at work today or doing something else?", "Yeah, I can understand that. Sometimes when you're not in a position to enjoy yourself because you're busy being tied down with responsibilities, it's easy to get mad at others. Whatever you can do to spin it positively, I would suggest that. Being negative about it will only make everyone's lives worse.", "Yeah, thank god you are safe.  I don't know what I would have done if that happened to me.", "Thats good. I am amazed by people who think its okay to do that.", "Or that as well ha", "Was she disappointed?", "Is he healthy?"]
