", "They left you all alone? I bet you feel lonely...", "I know that feeling. I like to keep the TV on to drown out the silence", "Whoever ate it all is evil!!!", "I know right. I would be so furious!", "I would do it! Try to be calm about it at first and see how he responds.", "Yeah, something should be done about it!", "I've done that before when I was just annoyed with them. Don't feel bad!", "Who cares! I always like to think of satisfying myself first before others!", "Oh no! That's a smelly situation to be in. What did you end up doing to fix it?", "What a pain! I bet that cost a fortune.

What breed? ", "Oh no! that sounds so scary. was everything ok?", "Good I'm glad to hear that.  That's a long time.

I hope the heaviness lessens one day at a time <3", "surprise gifts are always fun.", "that sounds like a well deserved plan.", "Oh man, I can relate, that feeling of anxiety before you get there really turns around when you get caught up in the moment", "Life is full of experiences like that, they seem scary from the outside, but once you relax you get swept away", "that sounds prettty bad!", "I cannot imagine if something like that happens to me. I would be trying very hard to find it.", "Sometimes by remembering all the places that you have been in the past two days can help. I will try that!", "I agree completely it is an embarrassment to the parents you would think. ", "The frustration they go through well at least we don't have to take the kids or parents home.", "I was going to Walgreen's and they was out and the sale began today. ", "It get's worse no rain check but they insist on giving me customer service number to still receive points towards my card.", "Aw man, I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to make you feel better? ", "Ice cream cake is my favorite! I'm glad you're feeling better haha. You have a really nice co-worker.", "That's really awesome! She sounds like a great person to work with.", "Oh, I know how that goes. My husband loves sweets, but if it is just sitting there and no one is eating it It will get eaten right then. Getting another would depend on how much he likes sweets and needs them. lol", "That's probably what I would do also. It won't kill him to wait another day.", "Exactly! I wasn't in a hurry or anything but it felt so inconsiderate.", "We can only hope.", "Oh man, that must have hurt. Did she know you had feelings for her?", "Sounds like your friend broke bro code, that was kind of scummy.", "Yea I was really thankful and appreciative for it.  He's like a brother to me.", "It really does.  I think when it comes to friends quality is better than quantity.  I like to have friends that feel like family.", "That must of been a proud moment for you as a father.  She's all grown up and out in the real world now", "That's awesome, she'll have a great time and learn a lot i'm sure!", "Oh they are long gone,lol. Bills to pay and all.", "They sure do. The raffle did allow me to get ahead of things for a while though.", "Haha yeah it was pretty funny once I realized what the spooky sound coming from the kitchen was.", "I turned off the TV and my phone and tried to trace the sound to its source. I feel ridiculous about it now in hindsight!", "Fun but scary I couldn't wait for it to end lol had my eyes closed most of the ride. ", "My hands was up and feeling the wind in my face and facing my fears but I kept them closed because I just couldn't look because of the height lol. ", "I am so sorry to hear that. I'm sure she was very happy while she was alive with you guys.", "You went through a lot of losses.", "That sounds painful, I hope you were okay after your fall. ", "Yeah i bet that was really embarrassing, but I'm glad you're okay. ", "Oh boy!

Prayer is always a good thing to do! That is so incredible.  Are you enjoying the job?", "Well I was really looking forward to the Super Nintendo.  It had just come out that year and everyone my age wanted one.", "Yea, they tried to trick me and wrap a box of clothes the same size to make me think I didn't get it.  My favorite game has to be Earthbound.", "You're right, the other people probably hardly noticed. And no, thankfully I was OK! Unless you count the bruise on my ego.", "That's solid advice, thank you. And yes, I own a helmet, but admittedly don't wear it as often as I should. I will now!", "How'd the hurricane go?", "Thank goodness. Hurricanes are no joke.", "Was he okay?", "Well maybe if you do it a little more then he will be fine with it.

I am sure you have got everything.", "That was very smart thinking on your part. Have fun on your trip!", "We all do things we regret when drinking", "Thats usually how it goes", "You definitely took a leap of faith there. How'd it go?", "hahaha I definitely admire your courage to have done that.", "I wish you luck", "I am sure you will meet them", "That's disappointing. What happened?

Sundays are supposed to be breezy", "Hm, that sounds interesting. I'm not really familiar with this kind of situation, since I've never had to rent a car.

I never really studied much so I could have done better on my tests", "Oh yes.

It's a subtle, but important diffeence", "Judging by the :(, I'm assuming you didn't get to join them?", "I would be envious too.  Perhaps next time you can go somewhere and return the feeling :D", "I hope where ever you go, you visit someplace amazing!", "Yeah I definitely like a lot of pizza.

If they can't, maybe they aren't good employers.", "Time does fly really fast. I just turned 30 and it feels like I was just a teenager yesterday!", "I'm sure it will. At least it gets us to enjoy life more and focus on the moment.", "Yeah, it's like a small world.", "I think it is merely a coincidence.", "Indeed they can. Is there any specific moment that you would like to talk about?", "Oh, I see. I thought that some other bad things happening in your personal life are making you cry", "I completely agree. We must have positive thoughts at all times. ", "Our thoughts are were everything starts. Mindset is so important. ", "That's awesome!

Some people, once they get started, they just can't stop themselves. It's like opening a can of Pringles.", "Did it feel good to get it out?", "Oh no, that's awkward! Did you get in trouble for it?", "That's heartbreaking, but you're amazing for doing that. Cats are my favorite and I've rescued many animals. It's a lot of work.", "Yes, and when they love you it feels special, because they don't love everyone like dogs do. You've racked up a lot of good karma for saving them!", "I'm there too. Struggling each day. It really gets old.", "Yeah, that's right. I've been pushing 70 hours working a week for as long as I can remember. Hold out, maybe it'll change.", "You would be so suprised at how much stays all the way in the nooks and crannies of your brain when you take a break!", "Im glad it paid off for you, you must be super proud!", "To be honest, I fell into a pretty deep depression. No one wanted to hire me. It was tough.", "I did, yeah. And strangely enough, the company hired me back a few years later when they were doing better cashflow-wise. ", "Good, how long has it been since you saw them last?", "I hope you all have some fun.", "Oh yes, fall is definitely my favorite season as well! I love fall scents!", "It is the best season, by far! Plus, Halloween!", "Oh man, those things are awful and reproduce like crazy.  We left our house for a week and came back to tons of them everywhere! The best trick is putting a little apple cider vinegar in a jar, a drop of dish soap on top of that and cover it with cling wrap and put holes in it.  They will gravitate toward it and you'll catch a bunch! Just keep changing it every few days.", "Seriously, gone is good.  They do have bacteria on them and lay their eggs on fruit and veggies and the larva burrow into the fruit or veggie so its good you trashed it all. Glad you're free of them!", "That is so exciting! It can be stressful and expensive planning a wedding.", "It really gets stressful when you get down to the last minute. You are always so worried you are going to forget something.", "oh that was nice of them", "haha thats pretty fun", "Oh no, I am sorry to hear that. I hope that he gets to feeling better. How old is he?", "Oh I see, I can understand your concern. Perhaps he will live longer than most hamsters!", "Yes, that's exactly how I felt. I suspected they'd been in trouble for a while so when they asked me to come back and help them out it felt really good.", "Thank you!", "That is quite upsetting. Do you know what ails it?", "Well I certainly hope that the dog gets to feeling better. Are you close friends with this canine companion?", "Well unfortunately the day before we were due to go my little 2 year old daughter woke up covered in spots.  As the day went on more and more appeared and she had a roaring temperature.  We realised she had chickenpox.  She was feeling so miserable and of course all she wanted was her mummy and daddy.  It was a bit depressing and part of me was devastated but our weekend away was not to be.  Sure kids always come first dont they?!", "Very true and thats the way to look at it. I was a bit dispirited but the hotel were great and re-arranged it for us and to be honest I could never have left my baby when she was poorly. The best made plans dont always work out when you have kids, but hey I wouldnt change them for the world.", "Wow thats nice.  What do you drive?", "You have to think of the positives.  Just because they have a new car doesnt mean their life is great.  They could be watching you wishing they were fit and healthy like you are.", "lol and some day you might you buy your own new Tesla, if you feel like it!", "Exactly!", "oh thats nice", "yea i would be to", "Why's that?", "Nostalgia is a weird feeling.", "Nice, what do you have planned?", "Sound great, I'm happy for you!", "It felt amazing to be recognized for my work, and in a publication I respect to boot! ", "Well I certainly wasn't expecting it so who knows, maybe one day you will!", "What are some things you will bring?", "It's a good idea to write thing down that you might forget.", "What is wrong? Are you okay?", "I am so sorry. I hope you get all the help you need.", "We have been getting a lot of rain as well. I have to mow my lawn so much.", "Yeah I know what you mean. I can't wait for the rainy season to end.", "I wish people would pay more attention. I try to do my best to follow the rules of the road both when I'm on my bike and in a car.", "Thank you, I appreciate that!", "Wow, congratulations! Have you guys set a date yet?", "Oh I feel you, I used to work in the wedding industry. It's crazy how much it costs even for the most basic wedding.", "I know exactly how that happens. Sometimes the food is just too good to pass up.", "Well I say go for it. It is only your birthday once a year. The other 364 days can make up for it.", "Glad to hear you are having a good day. Wish every day was like that.", "That is true. It puts things in context.", "That is really awesome! That is so important to be involved in his life like that. ", "It does! Kids can understand things about the bible that most adults overlook. ", "Exactly! It rained the other day and my package was totally ruined.", "Thank you! At least I was able to get it replaced.", "I was really upset at the time but once I had some time I realized it was an honest mistake. She felt really bad about it.", "When I'm ready, I think yes.", "I feel the same way as well!  I get really excited thinking about decorating and giving gifts!", "I agree!  Everything that surrounds Christmas makes me smile and feel content.  It makes me thankful for everything good in life!", "That's a great outlook I think. We often lose focus of that very important fact.", "That's inspiring to me. I will try to think more like that as well whenever I get stressed in life.", "Yes, my first time out in 60 days. I impressed my self.", "Not really. A few years ago I got tired of being fat so one day I just went out and started running. Two months ago I stopped due to hurting my back surfing. I got the all clear yesterday and went back out.", "It's taken me 11 years to get to this point. Last time I let her have at it. She bought us a trip to mexico on my credit card.", "It was fun. Adults only resort, all inclusive, private swimming pool off the room but cost 500 a day.", "Oh wow, an additional 40K is a lot! I'd be willing to put up with quite a bit for a pay increase that large.", "Oh wow. I'll be honest and say it wouldn't be worth it for me! What's an extra 40K if you're never not at work to enjoy it?", "Oh wow, I think it'd take me much longer to not bust my butt! That is impressive!", "Maybe she's more athletic than you think! She might be better than you soon. Better watch out!", "awesome! what kind?", "oh man those are super nice! all electric is pretty neat", "That's good on his part, how do you feel about it?", "That's awesome, and I agree, the job market is tough now a days.  High paying or not.", "Oh that's no good. Any special reason why they were late?", "That's a bad attitude to have. I hope he can straighten up a bit if we wants to keep working there.", "It will be okay. It's always hard making that step, but it's good for your health to do it.", "I wish my insurance would give me something like that! It's good to go anyways.", "Have you studied for it?  Always helps to prepare!", "Good luck, I'm sure you will do fine!", "Hey everyone trips up a little. What you need to remember is that you and your wife made a commitment and you should follow through on that. ", "It's ok to have a cheat day everyone once in a while, but you can't give in. Be strong!", "You only get to do it once?", "Oh no. I hope it goes well for you. That's a lot of hard work.", "Congrats!", "Was it more than expected?", "That has happened to me, but with texts though lol", "Did you apologize?", "LOL", "what's wrong with it?", "can you fix it?", "Not really. I average 10 miles a day walking at work but did that when I was fat as well. I cut out all processed foods and drinks.", "Rough. I used to like Iced tea and now only drink black coffee or water. I miss flavor. Plus it's a lot of work cooking everything.", "did they notice it was missing?", "well at least you are attempting to be honest about it.", "Ohh wow! Are you excited?", "Ohh that stinks. I dont blame you though", "Yeah that's what made it weird, it was kind of like he was trying to hit on me but just awkward. But he was really pushy about it.", "I hope that's all it was and not that he had some bad motive.", "Ouch!  Did she hurt it or is it a degenerative thing? I hope she can find help with physical therapy.", "Oh good.  Hopefully she'll try to fix it with physical therapy first.  Some doctors love to do surgery right away when its not necessary.  Recommend that she get a second opinion.  Hope she resolves it!", "I've never understood that, it's not like they can't afford to eat since they have a job! Do you know which coworker it was?", "Next time bring your lunch in a biohazard bag, maybe they will leave it alone.", "I blocked her and sent her a long text explaining how angry and disappointed I was. I didn't know what else to do.", "You're right. It makes me less likely to trust others in the future.", "how do you know no one goes in if you arent in there?", "ok", "It's funny you say that, I actually like that about cats. They are independent and not too needy, which sort of describes me! I love my cats... the peeing on my bath mat aside.", "Here's hoping your cat grows on you, they have a funny ability to do so.", "Thanks! The work isn't terribly exciting but it felt good not having to negotiate knowing the client wanted me to do work for them.", "That always makes it worth it to be honest!", "What! First of all, are you alright?", "Oh, well that's something, at least. I can't believe people are such cowards, though.", "That's great. Do they know?", "Well that is awesome. I bet they won't let you down in the new positions either", "I have never run a marathon", "You can try your best and if you don't finish there is always the next one", "Well that's some sort of motivation lol", "Astrophysics", "I have another 3-4 years then I'll go into teaching.", "No it's mostly I feel behind on my thesis. When I started they told us keep up or drop out. I should have known, it's one of the hardest schools to get into.", "Cornell University, after this year I transfer to Princeton for my PhD", "I need to get it over. I need to start paying back student loans. It's the last thing I need to do before I can get hired as a Ad Professor. ", "I've been paying on mine and have 75 still to pay. Then I want a PhD so that will be another 50k", "I know he has to spend time with others but I get envious I want every minute spent together I'm spoiled lol.", "I do best feeling ever.", "Aw, it takes time! Making friends isn't always so easy so give it a little bit of time", "The best thing to do is join clubs and get involved. You generally make friends by association!", "that is really nice of you to do, not a lot of people help others like that anymore", "same with me if i ever see someone that could use my help, i will most likely bring it to you", "Ah dang... Sorry that happened to you. It stinks too because a lot of the time that stuff is just decided by who is liked more, or who has better connections, and not actual merit. If you're good, I'm sure you will get recognized at some point.", "Well, keep a good attitude. If you like the work and the job, hopefully that will be enough.", "Thats very sad to hear im sorry that happened to you ", "I would suggest moving on time heals all wounds", "Did she say thank you?", "What a lovely woman, and you're lovely, too!", "That's the worst! What did you do?", "That sounds like a good idea. I hope you solve the problem quickly!", "Yeah, those were better times. Brings back good memories.", "Well, maybe yours. Mine just want to sit inside and play on their phones all day.", "Oh man..I have had those too..and where I am the one getting crap even though I do my job and everyone elses..I HATE sitting around at work...I either want to work or go home. I hope your boss knows your co-worker is lazy?", "I AGREE and frankly if your boss does not see this and doesn't give you praise then I would quit as well or contact human resources! This kind of stuff is not acceptable.", "sounds like you ate a delicious dessert, what did you eat?", "that sounds delicious i love chocolate cake i think that would be my favorite dessert", "O? That's a brave and noble decision.", "That's hard but great of you to do, good luck.", "Where will you be shopping?", "Nice! Do you have anything in specific you want to buy?", "hahah it whas happened to me it the worst thing", "did you still eat it? or did you throw it away", "That's nice of them! People stopped doing that for me once I got older. I miss them", "Well, I'm happy for you :) It shows that they care", "Thats horrible! Im so sorry to hear that.  Why would she do that?", "It depends, if you love her, you could try to work it out.  Or you could cheat on her too", "O yea? I", "I'm trying to teach mine tricks myself* I think that's fun to watch!", "I've cheated on occasion. It's never right but it's easy. At least you're ashamed of it.", "That's your decision to make, but I think it would at least put you in control of the situation.", "That sounds fun. Is it a special occasion?", "I understand. Sticking with what you know seems safer.", "you must be loving it", "true that, you cant be too sure until you use it", "Tough week ahead. Do you think you have met your expectations thus far?", "Sounds good. Your supervisor must proud of your work and your displayed high self-esteem", "I am, it went up 20 dollars. ", "I have to go over the paperwork, it may be because my insurance went up.", "I buy those like twice a year and never win.", "Wow! That's awesome! What did you do with it?", "Hey, why not? It's unexpected money!", "Yeah I feel like you get lucky once then it's all downhill from there.", "In a spare bedroom with her ex, laying on the bed and kissing him.", "Worked out for the best, she was honestly a pain anyways.", "I love the rain.  It makes everything feel fresh.", "I agree.  It hasn't rained here in weeks.  I miss the raing.", "I bet you are. What are you going to do? ", "sounds like a real good time i hope you enjoy it ", "Why is that ", "You will be alright buddy", "What have you done this year if you dont mind me asking?", "That is great, well there is still time to go this year!", "I love it when it's nice out. Are you going to do something outside?", "That sounds great. A nice long walk in perfect weather. There's hardly anything better.", "Are you excited for him or jealous? lol ", "I feel you! I know its hard having siblings sometimes! Go buy a toy car and park it on top of his. ", "Can you report the caller?", "Be sure to do it, otherwise they could keep harassing you", "chemistry", "yes!", "That's great.  Have they always been as supportive as they are now", "nice.  what do you do for a living", "I thought about it but they were coming from the grass around it and I'm worried the dog would get sick if I sprayed the grass", "Hopefully. there were so many I thought I was in a jungle.", "Same here, I'm in Texas.  Where are you located", "Nice! I used to live in St. Paul, MN.  Weather's like a tundra which is why I'm down here", "Were you able to get inside fast?", "Oh wow! That would be annoying!", "How did they get off work midweek?", "That would be nice but not fun that you don't have the same days off.", "where is your favorite place to go?", "i can imagine, i hope you have a great time this year", "They sent out an email saying that he may end up with a substitute teacher until they hire someone. ", "It is! And we are paying for the school, I'm not to happy.", "No, it is difficult to meet people in my area because I like in a farm. I only talk to the animals", "Can you be my online friend?", "that would hurt my feelings. are you alright?", "i totally understand that. i'm sorry.", "That sucks! Did you have a spare on you?", "That is good to hear.", "That's understandable. What kind of project was it? Were you involved?", "That's so generous of you. It's people like you that make the work week bearable!", "It went pretty well! I got great grades and made friends despite the age difference.", "Thank you! In the end I had no reason to worry about it.", "Oh wow. I would have been so scared. more of a stranger than the storm", "Well that was nice. How long were you stuck there", "Did the ads bring up good memories I hope?", "I have absolutely no idea what Boglins are, but I'm sure they were awesome!", "Sounds frightening! Was this off the coast of a beach or something?", "That is one of my greatest fears. Did you have to swim sideways from the current to escape?", "Great to hear that you made it out ok!", "Well, I can understand that. It's very hard to be on a very strict diet, without a break here and now!", "Well, i am sure you are disappointed, but all you can do now is just get back on the diet again and try to be more dedicated. It's hard, I know!", "Yes I am going for nursing I can't wit I am over joyed going to be hard work but I got this.", "That is great to know I can't wait soon will be like you.", "Yes we did my mom loved her so much especially when me and my brither moved out she is hurt and down so bad.", "Thank you and yes but I want to give her time to heal hopefully by Christmas she will be a little better and open to it.", "Yea, a new job is useless pretty stressful.", "It will be ok in the end.", "Yeah it was!

I just hate having to deal with the insurance, but at least I had insurance!", "Sorry to hear that", "Well that's good. You never know what to say in that situation", "I wish yo the best", "It was brilliant.  My mum must have gathered it up over the years.  I spent hours going through it all.  it made me feel so nostalgic.  I think its a great idea though, I might start doing it for my kids.", "No sadly so i didnt even know it was there.  Was definitely a wonderful surprise to find it.", "What was?", "Really? Did you manage to cope?", "And was there?", "Good", "Thanks. I still think about him all the time.", "I had two at the time so I still have one cat now :)", "Really, how did they do it?", "Amazing! Well done to him.", "Well done, at least you will sit in your room excited and relaxed now", "Heat wave is getting so terrible theses days. I even watched on CNN that the whole of New South Wales is experiencing a drought, so sad", "That sounds unfortunate. You must have been so annoyed with him!", "People like that should just do shopping online instead of ruining the experience for everyone else!", "Do you have daughters of your own?", "Why is that?", "yea traffic sucks", "well yea thats true", "Same here. It reminds me of my childhood for some reason.", "Exactly, i am overcome with nostalgia and get tears of joy sometimes. ", "I bet! Did it turn out nice?", "That's good...

Good on you- stand up guy", "Lol- Well poor you. I have always had guys doing the same and it means nothing to me. If I am in a relationship..or heck even when I am not..I don't get interested in random people generally.

Also pay attention to what you eat as well. It's even more important than the exercise portion.", "I don't know whether that's a good or bad thing. Which is it?", "That's great! It's definitely a good thing when you can be yourself.", "What was it I wonder?", "It must've been nasty like puke", "I like that philosophy. Here lately, has it been easier or harder to stay positive?", "I like that, how long have you felt this way about life?", "wow, its good to warm", "it is easier to walk around when its sunny also", "What exactly did he do>", "Yes, some people have to stay away form law enforcement jobs.", "Wow!

I think you should tell her the truth about what really happened.", "That sounds like a great idea!", "Oh no! You have to have a tough mentality when you do that as it can be rough to have people see you fail", "That's good! Practice makes perfect and if everyone stopped when they failed, we would not have as much as we do today", "That's terrible. Did you let others know that you had completed the job?", "I could imagine. Some people stoop low to take credit for what others do.", "what kind of surgery was it?", "Thats awesome! Its great to have friends their for someone.", "No she got me with those eyes but I was very irate with her for a few days and she knew it.", "It is they are loving she didn't mean to I bet lol.", "Congrats to you!

", "You will get it happy thoughts only and if not something better is in store. ", "It sounds like you are a great parent.  Does she appreciate all the help you give?", "She will definitely appreciate it when she gets older too.  I still remember my dad helping me with math homework and cant thank him enough for the help he gave me throughout the years.", "Im sorry about that. How did you find out?", "That stinks. Are you still with her or did you leave her?", "Whoa that is really cool. Did you train him to do that?", "That is amazing. Must be a very smart dog.", "I understand! As we get older, it's hard to do it all everyday!", "It happens, but definitely be honest as you would want someone to be honest with you", "Oh no, are you able to afford the repair for it?", "What a great friend you have. Definitly get him a gift when you are done.", "I'm about half way there. I want to save enough to rent a cottage on one of the lakes up there so I still have a ways to go.", "Thank you. I hope i reach my goal.", "That's really good! Do you think you're ever going to use the card again?", "That is wise. I too am trying to pay off my credit card debts.

And I was so confident that we would!", "We did!  And some of the research work that we did let us experiment more than normal.", "congrats! you must be proud!", "My daughter is only in eigth grade we have a while to go", "That is good to feel that way. You don't want to feel like someone close to you would let you down. Did it work out for you?", "Oh I am sorry. That is sad. Remember that it is not your fault. I would think of the people who have been there for you. ", "Oh gosh, you also scared of bugs?? That's my worst fear", "I would have a heart attack! ", "I have no idea what those are!", "oh ok. I like ravioli is it like that?", "What are pierogies? a type of food?", "Ah nice, I love dumplings, what are in them?", "That's no good, did you throw it out?", "Hope you don't get sick!  That would be a bad start to the weekend.", "Oh, I am so sorry. It has to be the most difficult thing to have to do. I had to do that with my gorgeous lab - I still miss him!", "Indeed they are. And so are many cats - the farm I used to live on has a ginger tom. He's quite the character and used to visit me regularly!", "This fella is called Oliver. He's a big old softie who is ace at catching gophers. He would bring half eaten ones to my door!", "Oh, I shouldn't be ungrateful, lol! At least he kills them before delivering them. A friends cat used to deliver live mice into the bathtub!", "Not yet but I did get a raise!  If the company takes over I will get to be in charge of the helpdesk though!", "Thank you! It's insane up here sometimes but I feel like I could be a good team lead.", "Oh no!  What has you scared?", "It'll be okay I promise.

It was so  laid back and chill.  I also made a ton of great friends there.", "Are you having any specific problem areas?", "Okay. I hope you do well too.", "They haven't made them for quite a few years.  But I met a guy that just picked one up in the last few days!", "We don't have a huge family, just 5.  But my wife does daycare, and our current vehicle only has 5 seats, so she's stuck at home fairly frequently.", "Thanks!  If not, we'll still manage just fine.  It would be nice, though.", "It is a big change. What is scaring you?", "I hate bugs too. You should exterminate before you move in", "Is it really far?", "oh no. im sorry to hear that", "Well, that would be terrifying! Were you afraid that a vampire was there?", "Well, that would be very creepy! They would hear my scream in the next town over!", "You were ready? That's good to hear.", "Aweomse.  Treat yo self.gif", "Are you prepared?", "I bet. Good luck to you", "Yeah, everyone else was just gone.  It was nice for a while, but got a bit lonely.", "It did toward the end of the day for sure!", "That's great. What classes are you taking?", "That's pretty cool... Are you going to go towards hardware or stick with programming?", "You should go all out and get a EE degree to go with it.  You can do microprocessor design.", "Any time. Have a good weekend :D", "Did that happen tonight?", "Well, it must've been something you said.", "Did she have a party?", "Does she have her license yet?", "Well, there's no hurry in driving, is there? What does she do mostly on her phone? Text??", "Does she play any sports?", "That's super frustrating! I've only ever had outside pets so I can't really offer advice, but it's one of those things where your anger is all misplaced because you know you can't really be upset with the dog since it doesn't know any better.", "It'll be well worth it when she gets the hang of it, but urgh. Bathroom problems are why I don't think I want a kid anytime soon!", "You got a present? How lovely! What was the occasion?", "Well, happy anniversary! What was your present?", "I agree.. Did something happen?", "I'm sorry.. Not everyone is bad.  Just a lot of people.", "That was nice", "Do you have anything in mind?", "So, I take you left to live someplace else?", "Just remember to never invite you ex-roomate to your new place, EVER!!!!!!", "Very nice, congrats on making it that far. I actually was in the same situation about a week ago.  How do you feel you match up to the others?", "I would be upset too.  However, I wouldnt get discouraged though.  There may be another opportunity even better that comes along soon.", "That's great, it's good to see people finish what they start. You must be very proud.", "Well, hopefully there will be nothing but great things for him in his future.", "I am so glad to hear that.  Did he find a job?", "That is good to hear.  What will he be doing?", "Oh that's wonderful! How long have you two been dating?", "It's a huge step, congratulations! ", "Sometimes deaths affect us even when we're not really close.", "Guilt can be a terrible thing to live with.", "Is he sick or just being lazy?", "I hope he can get the help he needs and maybe a job he enjoys more.", "Oh, well that's awful on a little person! I never liked it when a teacher did that when a child needed to go to the bathroom!", "LOL, well, that's good to know. So am I!", "Yes. After 3 years of working with her she finally started to take her medication as prescribed as well as watch her carb and sugar intake. I checked her blood sugar today and to my suprise it was normal!", "I agree!. I was so proud of her and her test results surprised me! ", "Thats... uh... strange?", "I think so, you're two peas in a pod.", "Pets are great, but they can be a bit needy for attention at times. It is great, but not when you are busy and trying to get things done.", "A walk will definitely help. He will probably be ready for a nap when you get back, then you can get some work done.", "Oh my god! That's terrible!", "Oh that's so great!", "That's amazing!  Congratulations!  Swimming can be tough", "LOL I bet you use that line all the time!  I love it", "Oh man! I hope no one noticed. ", "I'm glad that it all worked out!", "Oh, I bet you are really torn.", "I'm sure he will love that. I bet you will see the joy just shining in his eyes.", "That's one of the hardest parts of life. What happened??", "That is hard! Relationships are hard work.", "That is great of them, did you do anything to pay them back?", "That is nice of you, glad you have supportive friends!", "Aw poor mouse. I have had a few before..We actually rescued a few from our cat :/ ", "They have live traps to catch and release that are only a couple bucks. Mice really are sweet natured.", "What happened to them?", "Good, sorry you were inconvenienced, hope things get more consistent!", "that sounds like fun. for some reason kids really enjoy cooking.", "that sounds like fun. i want to try to make mozzerella", "Did you study for it at least?", "That is true, well best of luck to you friend!", "That is bad. What did you do after that?", "Did he say sorry?", "What show was it?", "is that the one with Bryce Dallas Howard?", "Oh? What about them?", "That's true. Any memory in particular?", "The hottest it got was 99 degrees. It has been in the mid 80s mostly, but I was expecting cooler weather in New England.", "I don't like it at all, but I can put up with it until fall.", "Did you feel lonely, or were you happy to have some time to yourelf?", "That is tough when you're not used to being alone.

He didn't hurt her did he?", "Oh no!!! Where did you end up going?", "That was so awesome of your mom :)", "Why did they do that?", "That is terrible. Those days, a lot of people do stupid things.", "Children usually do really well, they are versatile. ", "I hope he continues to do well.", "Are you excited or will it be lonely? ", "Yeah that is scary. I am sure she will do great things though!", "I bet it was really quiet and lonely. Did you find some time for yourself though?", "I don't think I would like that quiet either.", "Well that's not good. I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think maybe you were just too nervous during the test?", "Never be too confident! You've got to give life your all at every step.", "I agree. I dont know why they work in the service industry if they don't like to be nice", "Fast food employees are the worst sometimes... it's like we bother them", "How exciting!!!  I bet you are thinking already about  how you want to decorate it and fix up the lawn, etc..", "I can imagine!  It is certainly an exciting time.  I bet you are just over the moon happy!", "Anything that made you happy", "can you share anything", "Are you trying to save money by not eating out at work?", "Well, it can save you a bunch of money!  Plus you gain the time that you would normally spend going out somewhere and you can use that time to have more of a break.", "Oh my! I bet you was so disgusted that you ran out of there. ", "Yikes! Why in the world would somebody do that?", "Whoa! That is really scary! I've felt weird sensations like that before.", "No!

A professional setting is supposed to be ... well, professional.  What steps are being taken to correct that?", "I agree.  I hope it will be.  Team building, communication, and professionalism will all help a company.  I think this is why so many companies fail.  ", "Wow, you do really live far from your parents. Do you go to college or work?", "I see. Well, it seems as people get older they want to go back to places which reminds them of past. Nostalgia probably helps them cope with passing life", "I can see how that would be a downer.  Will you still get to see them?", "At least they aren't gone completely, but I can understand how that would affect your day to day work life.", "i would be really annoyed myself, why so many frequent calls ?", "i know ever since i purchased a new car, i know for a fact i did not read the fine print but insurance companys call me almost every day multiple times a day , its really annoying ", "I know right! my parents love tennis, so I grw up watching it.", "were you ever any good at it?", "Good for you to have such memorable experience to have and remember of.

Done that before!", "Yeah nothing like calling the locksmith and admitting you are not very bright. Haha.", "Did you not want to go out, or did you just not like the movie?", "Just be careful with that. If you feel tired due to stress, it may be the stress talking and not you.", "Great, when will you know your scores?", "Wow, that's fantastic.", "Who doesn't?", "What a jerk!

I hope people helped you to pick them up (and didn't help themselves!).", "Glad you find humor in it! I dropped a bottle of water once, which rolled under the car. I was livid!", "That's extremely frustrating! What were they expecting you to do? It's not your fault your roommate left it trashed.", "Well, I guess the good news is that he no longer lives with you. But that blows, how hard is it to clean up after yourself before you leave?", "That's what I told the hostess. There was no point in calling ahead if we still have to wait 45 minutes for a table.", "The food made it worth the wait, for sure! Any other restaurant I would have walked out!", "Oh god! I haven't had a puppy in a long time, but you forget all the things in your house that are not puppy-proof. They find ways to make messes in the most creative ways.", "Yeah, that's a real headache. I'd want to say they're worth it, but on that day I wouldn't be so sure, haha.", "That is a huge blessing, I don't know about you but my life is pretty much keyed into my phone.", "It's almost a shame how much we depend on them, but I know I'd be lost without mine.", "Do they run them all day long - or at night?", "Is there any kind of noise ordinance in your area?  I know in ours unless they are still running them at 11pm, there is nothing the police will/can do about it unfortunately - but I can imagine how annoying it is.", "I don't blame  you because I hate camping.", "Oh I hate ticks and all the bugs.", "What happened?", "You are lucky to have such great friends!", "It has! The cut was so deep and I was bleeding so much I was scared of passing out from blood loss.", "Moral of the story: don't rip open cans with your hands!", "How come? Have you had awful weather lately?", "Oh I see. Beautiful weather is an excellent start to the day!", "Oh? Big decision. I hope you feel good about it!", "Aw, but they'll always be there for you when you visit. You have to do what you want to in life, after all", "Oh that sucks! What did your neighbor do to get you angry?", "How inconsiderate. People should have more common sense than your neighbor.", "thats awesome, i always loved giving gifts more than receiving them", "me too!", "I hate when I get teachers that are clueless. Makes you wonder how they got the job.", "Well done. You should feel proud for teaching yourself.", "That's always a great start to a day.", "How are you celebrating it?", "Oh wow. What's the exam on?", "That's really great. I am sure you will do well on the test.", "I think the other driver was falling asleep on the road. Out of nowhere, he moved onto the wrong lane directly towards us.", "Agreed. I was so scared we could have been the ones in a casket that night.", "Congratulations! Retail really does suck.", "Understandably. My girlfriend is a student and works in retail part-time. She says the same thing.", "Oh, all the time. What album is that for you?", "I really love that album! We will have to listen to it together sometime.", "That sucks. Did she make a lot of money off of it?", "I would've been very angry too. I hope the money went towards something useful.", "I am sorry to hear that. Why was it a bummer?", "That really stinks. I bet you felt really lonely and filled my regret.", "It is, I'm super happy. Currently playing some Zelda on the Switch, it couldn't get any better than this!", "I highly recommend it. I can't put it down.", "That is disappointing. I wonder why he's like that.", "I hope he doesn't let you down.", "Something good happen to him recently?", "That's amazing! Tell him congratulations from a friendly stranger.", "Oh no, that's not good! He's not the only one that's not great at French. Most of my family spoke French as a second language when I was growing up and I still never picked it up!", "Hopefully he'll get to enjoy his next summer.", "That sucks. Did anyone get hurt?", "I bet. I would've hid under the table.", "That's nice. Why do you say that?", "That's great to hear. I wish I had a helpful family.", "That's really selfish. Have you talked to her about it?", "Well, at least that's the case. People can only do so much.", "I couldn't find anyone that wanted to hangout so I had to spend the whole weekend by myself.", "I was feeling quite social, though, so it was kind of a buzzkill.", "Are the good memories at least?", "At least you have those memories. You should go on a vacation soon!", "The new Spyro Remastered. It really makes feel think back to when I used to play the original with an old friend of mine. ", "It comes out next month!", "That's rough. Why can't you help her?", "Yeah, I am in the same boat. It's a hard knock life out there.", "How long did it take them?", "He must of been sick after.", "That was probably a good plan to buy them ahead of time", "Wow, thats insane.  I feel like thats illegal", "My son got caught cheating on a test. I really thought we raised him better than to do such things but here we are.", "Definitely at least going to have a long talk about why what he did was wrong. There will be some kind of punishment that's for sure.", "Why don't you join them?", "Why don't you get another job?", "That's too bad. What happened? Is everyone OK?", "Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. I hoep your family is strong enough to support you through this.", "Holy cow.  Was anything missing?", "Had they gone through anything?", "It was! He got a lot of cool toys, and ate a bunch of ice cream.", "As he opened gifts, he told people thank you, and told them thanks for coming when they left.  I was pretty proud of our 4 year-old.", "that is awesome i will never forget the first time me and my wife went on vacation, where do you have planned to go?", "That sounds like you guys will spend a lovely time over there good luck", "Why! what is the reason", "Are you were near to your mom", "Oh man! I have been there, I hope you didn't have anything special down there??", "Oh lord, i am so sorry! I have been there, that is hard!", "taht sounds like fun, i wish i had coworkers that nice ahahah. did you enjoy the party?", "ahahaah seems to be they really like you working threre", "Aww, I'm sorry.  Is he going to be ok?", "I do too.  That's one of the saddest things.  I hope you'll be OK too.", "Not really, it still hasn't shown up!  I'm pretty annoyed!", "It's not that big of a deal, but I was really looking forward to finishing the project.", "oh that sucks.. did someone move it out of the way?", "yea you never like to see stuff like that.", "did you try to find its owner?", "well that was nice of someone", "That's annoying, are you going to talk to them about it?", "I hope it all works out in the end.", "Awesome! Can you say what kind of project it is?", "I hope so too! Projects can be stressful!", "My cat hasn't been feeling well this past week, I think there might be something really wrong.", "I know. I'm so worried.", "You're welcome. It's always nerve wrecking when family is sick like that.", "I think there might be something wrong with the platform at the moment.", "Oh man, sounds like most kids. She's gonna hate it at first, but getting to bed early will help with her future.", "Well yea, they're young right now and can't see the consequences yet.", "that is so lucky, they must be so happy they bought that ticket", "i know that is such a bomber you must have been so angry hahaha", "What kind of test is it", "Oh I hope you do well then", "wow i didnt even know they had cruises that go on for that long", "yea i wonder how much something like that costs .. i guess if you have to ask you cant afford it as they say", "that is really nice of him, how much time will you have to wait?", "well i hope everything goes well at the bank and with the transaction", "that is horrible, natural disaster are the worst because you cant do anything against them", "not really, the worst thing that can happen where i live is a thunderstorm", "I bet that was a wonderful day", "I am very happy for you", "that is not good, have you expressed your feelings to your boss?", "well i hope everything goes well for you, you will sure find something fitting for you dont worry", "I just tried to keep an open mind and go with the flow. It was hard to get used to sitting at a desk for 8 hours a day, but I soon got used to it.", "I agree. And if it doesn't work out, you can always move on to something different.", "Oh no, that's bad.   Have you had someone come out and check the hose?", "May be worth letting your insruance comapny know. Usually they have clauses that you have to tell them as soon as you see it otherwise they won't cover any of it.", "It's our Rotty pup! Sorry haha", "Yes!  We had been waiting forever to find just the right breeder and then we found him oh my gosh.  That felt like the longest week of my life!", "Yes! It was awful! Luckily the man behind her spoke up. I could tell she was embarrassed but I was furious at her!", "I agree. I hate seeing kids having to live in that type of situation. some people shouldn't be parents", "OMG that's so gross! ", "That would be a memorable lesson to learn. The best lessons are learned that hard way, after all. ", "I felt gross hahaha I kicked it off of my shoe and stuffed it under a rack. I hope know one saw.", "hahaha hope they wear gloves!", "Oh dear. How do they let the parents know what's going on?", "That sounds really frustrating. I'm sorry that's happening!", "Oh wow.  Terrifying.  All I think of is Johnny Erricson Tada, who broke her neck in that situation. Did you do it?", "You did the right thing!  Oh fun!  I'm glad you were safe and had a blast! ", "Do you feel ready for it?", "Awesome, hope it goes as planned!", "Oh how exciting! Did you take any pictures?", "Awww...that's a bit disappointing, but really cool that you got to see them!", "The market can be competitive if the price is right. They'll sell immediatley.", "That would have been awesome if you got it.", "That's good! That probably means you worked on it until it became something you're proud of.", "Maybe I could learn from that. I get really nervous when I have to do any public speaking, so maybe if I just prepared for it better it would help.", "What did they do to you?", "It happens sometimes. you may ask them directly to pay back.", "I totally get that.  I'm in the same place with my daughter.  I home school and she's learning them too. Give it time and she'll get it soon.  Its so much to memorize at once! ", "That's awesome!  She will!  The best thing about homeschooling is that they can learn more at their own pace.  I'm not looking forward to division! ha ha", "Do you hike very often?", "I've never been hiking, really! I'd like to go some day.", "Oh, such fun!  Do you have all the Stamp It Up scrapbooking things I hear so much about? I bet it can be hard to keep it updated! They grow so fast!", "Perfect!  Now you'll be caught up in no time.  I know you'll be so gratified to finish and be able to look at all of them when he's much older.", "So sorry to hear of Sam's passing.", "May your many memories of Sam help you to sustain at this difficult time.", "That is awesome.  I'm with you on that.  Tough times might pop up now and then but life really is great.  I don't like to take it for granted.", "Exactly! You'll go far with that attitude!  ", "Mmm, now you're making me hungry for cake. What kind of cake was it?", "Personally I'm a huge fan of red velvet, but black forest is amazing too!", "Aww, I know that can be hard, but you can't be too hard on yourself.  Sometimes you don't have a choice.", "Absence makes the heart grow fonder.", "What are some of your best traits?", "Do you exercise often?", "No he was the runt so we got him on the cheap side!  He is sooooo sweet!  I am so happy", "Thank you!  We are so excited!", "I've never been, but it looks like so much fun.", "It would be so much fun to go there as a family.", "Oh yeah I am right there with you, I just don't even go out anymore if I can help it! How old is yours? Mines 2 1/2", "They are too smart for their own good", "what did you see? please don't tell me there was a bug in your bread", "ewwww, so nasty! i almost ate a molded avocado today. good thing i noticed before scooping it", "Ha, that's a really nice way of looking at it but nah I'm pretty sure it's mostly laziness.", "I thought about it but no, it's not worth rocking the boat. If she tries to pull that again and dump even more on us, then I'll probably say something.", "Did you call the police?", "Its horrible to have to got through things like thaty", "That's great! I'm so happy for you!", "Ooh, will you be managing anyone?", "Yes.  And to make it even worse I soaked myself!", "Right outside the office and with no spare clothes!", "I'm definitely proud! It doesn't feel bad at all. I'm so happy about how much drive she has to succeed.", "I'm maybe a little jealous, but I know how hard she works and how smart she has been with her decisions.", "It really is! Now I can go home and just relax for the rest of the evening.", "Nope, just me. So it's nice and quiet.", "Are you afraid of the dentist?", "I'm sorry to hear that, I'm pretty terrified of the dentist myself. Ask for gas! Good luck, I'm sure everything will be just fine.", "Oh nice! That's super brave of you.", "That's a great skill to have!", "That must have been a nice feeling. ", "I love that nostalgic feeling. ", "Haha, sounds like my pupper, is she still young?", "Right!? It's weird, you buy them all the toys in the world, but they still go after your stuff.", "He owns his own business working on cars. If something goes wrong, he is forced to stay to fix the issue.", "That's a good idea! Maybe I can have a boardgame night or something!", "Aww man that sucks for you ", "Hopefully! It is your dream car after all", "That should be fun. Any big planes?", "That will be nice to catch up.", "Not at all, that's what is so weird! She was really polite, quiet, and neat.", "I am! But whatever, nothing we can do but have the city come pick it up I guess.", "Oh no! That is terrible!", "I understand. Layoffs are hard. My brother in law has been through a lot of those at factories!", "How do you feel these days?", "It must be difficult, do you think she will come back ever?", "Well that's the cool thing... the week my unemployment ran out I got a job offer. At my former company, no less. So everything worked out!", "Haha that's an awesome way to think about it!", "Wow, that's incredible. What's their secret? ", "Congrats to your friend. I hope they share!", "That's unfortunate, hope you don't get it as well!", "I'm sure she will be fine with some rest and a little bit of time. ", "I was! The guy was really nice and refused the cash I tried to give him as a reward.", "Very! Lucky for me it was a cheap phone, I think if I had the newest iPhone or something I would have never seen it again.", "Did you bring them a pan of ludefisk first? What did they say?", "Next time they let you in, just steal all your favorite pieces of decor and replace them with brownies.", "Yeah, they are cute like that. How old is she ?", "I have a 10 year old like that.", "that's amazing. watching your children succeed is so rewarding", "that is awesome. i hope she has very much success in her gymnastic endevours.", "you are very welcome. good luck!", "I don't think she realized what they were. I was pretty irritated as they can't be replaced but what can you do?", "Good suggestion! Really I wanted to keep all the signatures and notes from my friends but oh well. I will see them next month for our reunion anyway!", "It was sudden. He was completely fine when we went to bed. No issues at all. Its been hard for our daughter", "I completely agree. I broke down just watching her cry at the spot where we buried him. I'm not sure if I want to get another dog yet. We have chickens so she's began to show them more attention now.", "I hope so. She has done well with tablets so I'm hoping she'll do the same with a phone", "This is true! I also put an app on her phone to block things she's not old enough to use", "Were they okay?", "At least you're not getting sued", "Im good at that lol", "This is my 3rd time and I'm still scared", "Have you ever went. When you looking down from 15,000 feet you get scared.", "Sometimes. I try to avoid that attic during any time of the day! There's also a weird door about knee-height. When you open it up, it's just big enough to fit a storage tub.", "It is really creepy! ", "Definitely, brought me right back to the road trips we took when I was younger.", "Everywhere! Sometimes we just hopped in the car and went like two or three hours from home just to do something for the day.", "whats the competition on ?", "Nice hope you win , ill be looking into this further ", "I wonder how that was noted on your report.", "Sounds like a wacky place to work.", "That is awesome. Congratulations. Im sure you earned every penny.", "Good things happen to people who put in the effort. It sounds well deserved.", "Oh no! Do you think it's a wild animal?", "I hope it's not a crazy person or worse, an alien waiting to abduct you!", "Its so hard to monitor that stuff now", "Yeah, that is a scary thing to think about too", "No! He's about 2 years old now. Sometimes I think he does it out a spite when he's not getting enough attention!", "That's not a bad idea!", "So check this out, I ordered a planter for my porch. That's how I know he did it, the exact planter I ordered and never got appeared on HIS porch a few days after my package went missing!", "Yeah, I'm pretty livid. I think I will report him to our HOA and see what they say.", "haha. I live about 1 hour south of Barrow the most northern place in the USA and about 12 hours north of any actual city. ", "It's the most beautiful place you can move just no one here. Me and the animals. ", "What kind of job was it", "Sales do sound hard to do", "Is he going to be okay", "I am glad then, I hate to see pets in pain", "That is quite an accomplishment.  Someone like that is really inspiring.", "Hahahaha, it's hard to compare yourself with that, but it really let's you know what's possible if you really want something.", "Why? Were they not working?", "He should have been honest from the start. It's on him not you.", "Do you think your boss will tell him it's you that told on him?", "That's so cool! Do you do a lot of climbing?", "Wow, so a proper adventure then. Have fun and stay safe!", "yea funny how that happens", "well at least its being put to good use", "Hey congrats!  Is it in the same field?", "Heyyy! That's awesome!  I wish you luck! Will it come with a sweet raise too?", "Congratulation. What is he planning to do next?", "Good. I hope it will help her in career growth.", "That's cool!  Maybe you'll get along great!", "lol why do you have to steer clear?", "ahhh.  I got you!  Well good luck on the relocation!", "That is a bad realization to come to.  Where did they all go?", "Yeah, that is tough.  Once you get to a certain age you have to work pretty hard to meet people.  Maybe you could join a softball league, that's what I did.", "It can be hard these days, money is tight", "I bet that was a nice surprise", "Did you get it all straightened out?", "Wow that is awesome, too rare in these times, count your lucky stars!", "Oh wonderful!  I'm glad it went so well!  Did she already know some friends there or was it a new school for her?", "Oh boy, I bet you were nervous.  I would've been too!  Sounds like she's got a great and fun year ahead of her!", "That is just gross!  Have you spoken to her about it?", "I hope the HOA does something about that - that's just disgusting!", "Very. It was nice and chill and low pressure, just how I like it.", "Not doing anything WAS my idea of fun!", "That sounds awesome, i bet you feel proud! Its nice to do things for kids who are in need.", "Of course! Dont let fear of not finishing stop you from doing anything!", "Oh gross, I would lose my appetite", "Yeah, I would probably just leave the restaurant altogether", "When I looked it up on line it was one of the garden snakes but I'm still frightened by them all lol even the harmless ones. ", "I will stay clear of them all not taking any chances. ", "Very bad and when my family has the house out of place I become so furious I just like things clean and in order.", "Yes and so relaxed and peaceful. ", "I totally did. And let the CEO know about his behavior.", "Unfortunately no, the CEO thinks he can do no wrong. Eventually he'll figure out what a jerk he is.", "I'm going for nursing and I have dreaded going back for 6 years now but my support system pushed me to follow my dream I'm thankful to have them.", "It is but I know the hard work will pay off in the end.", "I didn't get it.", "Me, too.  Then I found out someone else less qualified got it.", "That sounds like fun!  Are you big into biking?", "Mountain biking is great.  Is is really theraputic.  I hope you enjoy your new bike", "That's horrible. What can people do to change things?", "Yes! The weapons thing is so important. ", "Oh my gosh! That is horrible! I am so sorry to hear that.", "I understand that. Just give it some time and call when you are ready.", "It is and that's why I was nervous but the staff was so kind and open. ", "Lol don't be let's just hope I can still say this in 3 months. ", "That's awful! What did you do?", "No. I mean did you yell at the person or anything after they did it?", "Woah that's really bad!! Is it due to cost cutting? They let you off.", "it happens!! i hope you will find a better job with a better company!!", "Oh no, that's the worst.", "I hope you can get it back somehow!", "Finance, basically, but it was a little broader than that. I wish my mom were still around, she would have been so happy.", "Thank you!", "That is so romantic.  They weren't for any occasion?", "Were they your favorites?", "Oh yuck. Did you get a chance to return it to the store?", "That's crazy! I'd leave it on the counter at the store. Hopefully you aren't out much money.", "Wow that must have been amazing!", "They're going to remember that forever", "Dang, that sucks. Did you ever catch the culprit?", "Yeah, that guy sounds like a jerk. Did your insurance cover the dent?", "Oh wow! My dog Jr died of old age too.", "Oh, Did something happen to him?", "I am sorry to hear that. Mine died of old age as well last month.", "Me neither, but in the end, I really didn't think about him as a dog, he was just my buddy. I hope fond memories of him get you through this.", "That can be so aggravating. Did the company make it up to you for being so late?", "At least they made up for it. If they had not I wouldn't use them again.", "I know the feeling. What team is he rooting for? ", "I don't even know what team that is, haha. Football is lost on me. ", "Oh that's good, last time my computer broke was a day before I left the country", "I took it to the apple store and it actually got fixed in 5 mins, just needed a hardware reset", "Oh my goodness, is he with the armed forces?", "I cannot imagine how hard that is on the family and the soldier.  While I can't bring him home quicker, I do want to say thank you to you,  him and your family for your sacrifice.", "That is horrible, did anyone get hurt?", "Hopefully you had insurance and somewhere to stay.", "That is scary.  What was it?", "Gosh It's worse than I thought it would be.  What did you do?", "exam mark is low in school", "ok thank you", "He must be very smart", "It paid off. Wish I was smart like that", "Oh no. How old are you?", "Is there anyone you could go and visit and maybe stay the night?", "I'm sorry to hear that.", "I hope things are better next time.", "That's great to hear that some really care and put effort in to their relationships!", "Lol! Oh geez- so many take years to get it ugh! But at least he finally has! I hope he is very romantic too!", "Congrats <3", "Not yours? That is so weird, usually they  are on their way OUT not IN! Lol", "Did you eventually get it out? I would have been flipping bonkers! ", "That sounds terrifying! Im glad you have a basement though, it can be so dangerous if you have no underground place to shelter in!", "Oh your right, I have an almost 3 year old and I wouldn't know how to explain it as well! That is so hard sometimes because you don't know what to say!", "Oh my goodness, are you alright? I bet you created a mess!", "I hope you can laugh a little about it now!", "It is! I'm really excited for it! It's tonight, so it was also a big surprise! ", "I know! I wasn't really planning to do much this year hahaha", "I'm sorry to hear about that. It sounds like, to me, that he lived a long life with you though, and that you were able to spend a lot of time with him. I'm worried for my girlfriend and what she'll do when that happens to her and her dog", "That's crazy, and a little heart-breaking too. I'm envious of the bond and routine it sounds like you guys had. I have yet to develop a bond like that with a pet. I hope I do at some point", "That's so sad...Did you have a lot of good memories in that house?", "I'm so sorry :( At least you have your memories to look back on.", "That was really nice of him. I know that she had to be relieved.", "Someone was watching over her.", "How long had you been married ?", "Hmm. That's a bit of a strange story.", "I hate to hear that. I hate tickets. There are so many other things I would rather spend my money on.", "Yeah, that is such a silly thing to get a ticket for.", "Cool, what are you getting?", "That's a nice car, you are going to enjoy it.", "Neat! We took our daughter and her cousin camping about 2 weeks ago! Did ya'll build a fire?", "That's defiantly a priority! I hope you brought everything that you need. Forgetting something can be a pain", "Yes in multiplication! I'm glad she's finally grasped them. Now we just need to work on 6-12 hahaha", "She was!", "She is in 5th grade.", "We have been homeschooling. I'm having to go back to work now, so she's not too happy about it. I think she will be just fine that. She's well socialized ", "Where did you go ?", "We went there a few years back. Had a great time.", "Awesome news!  What was the response?", "Oh.  Not so good news then :(  I'm sorry.  I'm sure you'll find something!", "That's awesome, I bet you were overjoyed with it!", "You never know if someone is going to slip and spoil it for you, that's true!", "Oh no!  Do you have any way of finding out who did it?", "Yeah, thieves are terrible.  I mean, who would steal a mower?", "what did you do?", "yea i can see that, it happens but it sucks", "well atleast you watch them with him! i dont like them either. ", "Oh no, no thank you! lol ahhh i cant even. ", "That'll be tough.  Do you have anything you can do to keep busy?", "I bet.  It's sometimes surprising how much your life revolves around the other person being in the house.", "spray water over there", "thats good, you should", "I might give that a try. But whoever did it had probably better hope that I don't find out who they are!", "Well nothing too serious, but I'd definitely have a word or two with them!", "I get so worried about something happening to me.", "More of a human with intent to harm type fear.", "is it really hard? or you just have not have that much time to paly", "yeah some people are just naturaly good at video games", "That's pretty impressive, does he have any training or just all self taught?", "Well it's certainly nice to have someone around with handy knowledge like that!", "That is frustrating!  We have a couple down the street that raises hunting dogs.  So annoying all day!", "I am sure he thinks it's his world, the rules dont apply to him.  Sorry you have to deal with that people can be so rude", "Well you must be happy about it.", "Oh! that is bad then.  Be careful.", "I hope you hear good news.", "I understand. I guess you'll always feel that way.", "It was nice of you to buy him food, but I'm thinking he didn't pay you back.", "I'm sorry. I know it sucks to need money and be counting on it, and then you don't get it. I hope he pays you back soon.", "Ugh! I use to have the same problem with my neighbors dog who would poop in my driveway! At least it was my tires and not my feet that got the unpleasant surprise.", "Does this happen often? I'd let my neighbor know about it.", "That's great! You must have been so surprised and pleased to hear from them.", "I bet you had tons of catching up to do!", "The way you wrote that makes it seem like you're anticipating something bad... Do you mind if I ask what you're expecting to happen?", "Interesting... well then at least that leaves the possibility for something good instead. If you're not sure what it could be, then at least it's not some obvious mistake or negligence on your part. I hope for the best for you", "That is unfortunate, my own mother was ill for several years, she is getting older as well. Do you get to see her often?", "Just spend what time you can with her, I'd like to say something really profound but aging parents is a situation that just sucks. Sorry you are having to deal with it.", "That was great of him!", "He sounds very nice!", "Oh really what was the assignment", "It's always great to get back positive feedback!", "I was watching the front door like a hawk, and constantly checking for online tracking updates.  I kept worrying that someone would steal it of my porch if I didn't get it right away.", "Oh yeah.  As soon as I heard the knock I flung the door open and snatched it in a hurry.", "Im sure they had a good excuse.", "Oh I see. Hopefully its just that one time where he couldnt get to his phone to let you know.", "Oh crap! how long untill you realized?", "Thats so good, man I have done that a time of two.", "I am sure you will as well. Confidence is great!", "Congratulations. You have done great!", "That's really cool. What kind of car?", "That  sounds like a really awesome car!", "The edges are a little frayed but I can still make out everything on it.  I keep it in a zippered compartment to preserve it.  Maybe I'll frame it someday.", "Yeah, it's a nice little souvenir to remind me of good times.  It was a great concert and experience for all of us.", "We went to see Incubus, it was our favorite band going through high school.

Is your son afraid or is he use to it?", "I would hate that as well. I hope he learns to cope with it.", "That is a lot of extra money to spen, but it is completely understandable it you are that nervous about it.  Have you ever looked into calming medications, or meditation to help your nerves?", "I completely understand that.  My mother in law used to have really bad anxiety about flying, but she did hypnosis and it really helped. ", "Wow. That's intense. Did your home get any damage?", "Yeah. I feel for you. It hurts to lose things like that.", "That is awesome.  Happy Birthday!  What kind is it?", "Is that a gaming computer?", "Sorry to hear about that.

If you don't mind me asking, of course...", "Oh I see.. Well that's a pretty positive talent then, huh? Maybe you should encourage him to keep doing it. Maybe he misses it. You could get him a present for his birthday or Christmas that was related to drawing tools/pencils and all that.", "how is that working out for you", "practice makes perfect", "omg i would be upset too... how many times have you called them to fix it?

All my best friends were there and I got some pretty sweet gifts!", "I definitely think so!", "That's a shame! It was a festival called Pooza Fest. Many punk-rock and acoustic shows!", "I did, thanks for asking. I went with my older brother and a few of his friends. It was a blast!", "I won them by sharing and liking a facebook page! Unfortunately, none of my friends could go and so I ended up staying home instead.", "They were tied to my name, so I couldn't even sell them. Oh well!", "That is crazy!

I was anxious and scared to share, but I'm glad I did; they were really supportive and it's helped me a lot.", "They have, ever since I started taking meds and speaking to my doctor and social worker.

It's really frustrating but I think I'll just get whatever I can at this point.", "Thanks for the suggestions, I'm going to give them a shot!", "That is awe inspiring, very patriotic.  Did you get pictures?", "I'm sure, that isn't something you see every day, or would even expect to see ever.  I'm glad you got it documented.", "Well, that's great.

I hope she won't do that again.", "Moving is the worst.  All those boxes.  ugh. i hope i dont have to do it for awhile", "I hope its good that she moved in with you.  things must be serious", "That sounds pretty amazing, what convention was it?", "I'm so happy for you, it sounds like it was a wonderful opportunity!", "That is always so much fun.

That's a horrible prank!  I would be crying!  What did you do when your friend gave it back?", "I would have been really mad as well!  Hopefully he learned not to pull that kind of prank on you again!", "I'm sorry to hear that. Do you mind if I ask what happened today to make it so weird?", "Oh, I see. I think I kind of understand. It at least sounds like you're a really self-aware person, and appreciative of the small things, and that you have decent perspective on things. The emotions might be difficult to deal with, but at least there are some positives there for you to take stock of", "Crashed the car, totalled it too.", "I am, but I have to pay out to fix the car!", "My boss said there might be the possibility of a raise this month.", "That's why I'm waiting on it, but I believe that he might have given me it!", "I hate it when that happens! Were they driving fast at the time, it could have been quite dangerous.", "I can imagine, at least you got out of the situation safely", "That's awesome.

Do you anticipate to releax or do things to catch up?", "Very nice! I bet its going to be a good happy weekend. ", "I know, man just got together and buy like 50 boxes and cross our fingers.  And another thing was he got it on his first try both times.", "Haha, that's the spirit!  Win us some systems, sell them off and use the money to buy more boxes.", "We have been practicing together in my car , so I feel I can let him. ", "Yeah. I feel he wont let me down. ", "I dont know. I hate heights, so im very nervous about it", "I dont think I will ever not be scared of heights. The thought of it makes me have the chills!", "That sounds revolting! Have you said anything to him about it?", "That sounds like a good plan. Perhaps you should request a formal resume from any potential roommates for your future abode.", "well the library is very small so limited seats so I had to sit there and listen to it. I was so frusterated", "Yah I agree. I could understand if it was not so quiet and an open place. I can still hear it in my ear now!", "I never have. I think all this time I been practicing will pay off.", "I joined cross fit and did alot of cardio work outs.I think this helped me for it.", "What a nice surprise! Did something happen or did he miss you!?", "I see.I bet you and him are happy to be able to spend a little time together. ", "I'm sorry to hear. Why is that?", "Oh, well that is a fine thing indeed! I would be  jumping up and down!", "Sounds pretty lonely. Did you meet or make some friends while out of town?", "Ah I see. Staying focused is hard, especially when your lonely.", "Yeah she is. She is going to retake some classes she made a B in. The look on her face after she found out was pricelss.", "yeah thats what i said. Its like the world ended when she found out, but she is doing better now.", "Yeah I cant wait. I never been, so I cant sleep thinking about it.", "Yeah Im going to try, but its so exciting and my nerves are everywhere!", "For the powerball. We are all crossing our fingers!", "WE hope we do to!", "Yes it was. My phone rang and thats what woke me up. Im so lucky to be here today. ", "Yeah im very thankful I didnt crash last night. ", "That really sucks. Maybe you should try egging their door? Or just break in and pretend you're bigfoot while they're trying to sleep.", "I would go with the bigfoot option. You can get a costume on the cheap on ebay nowadays. I've used that tactic countless times and it has never failed!", "That is some exciting news. Do you already know what kind of vehicle you want?", "Christmas is coming early. You will have to take me for a ride.", "Thanks! It will be a breeze. ", "Statistics exam. I aced this class for sure. There's no doubt in my mind. ", "Don't be. i think you will ace it.", "exam's are always scary. we just need to take the mind out of it", "Why not block the calls?", "Have you asked them to stop calling about this topic?", "Have you spoken to him?", "Maybe you should buy some earplugs.", "I love tennis. Will you watch the US Open?", "It is a great tournament, you should watch.", "So are they telling you good news?", "Oh okay. Well hopefully they give you a chance to breathe and decide what you want to do.", "Ooh how nice! Do you have any guesses as to what she may be making you?", "Well I hope it's good! Your mom sounds like a great person to have a fun surprise for you like that.", "You are so lucky to find someone special online. That can turn out so badly sometimes for some people. ", "That sounds like fate? Being that both of you lived close to each other.", "Wow, watching kids grow up is hard. How has she been with the cell phone?", "That's great parenting! You have to trust that your children will make the right choices.", "I am sure with your guidance she will!", "You should go, Otherwise the condition could get worse.", "That is great news! fortunately doctors are there to help us and i'm glad they have helped you!", "Oh my goodness that sounds so bad! Did they charge you for the visit?", "You made the right move. They at least have to show up with that giant truck that sucks the tank dry.", "If I had a bag of M&M's right now I would eat them for sure!", "maybe save the other half for later. lol.", "That's ok, it happens to us all. Tomorrow is a new day.", "How did she reacted to the admission to self harm? ", "Now that your girlfriend knows the problem,  the both of you can work on solutions and support together.", "Is that like a laser tag place? That sounds like a lot of fun! What do you think?", "I've played laser tag a few times. I think you will have a great time! It's very high paced and noisy but that's half the fun.", "Oh that sounds worrisome, do you think you will pass?", "I'm sad to hear that but human nature is hard to fight. Honestly, if you have any alternative options or plans you may have to fall back on them.", "That sounds intensive! How did it go?", "I bet that was so defeating! I'm sorry to hear that. I wish there was better quality control with some of these companies that deal in parts.", "That's a good bright side to look at.", "Did you save it or kill it?", "It's missing a leg so its probably dead unfortunately.", "ooh, I bet you can't wait to finish!", "I hope you get it! Good luck!", "How did they go? Did you pass?", "Wow! congrats, you should totally be proud of yourself.", "That's very sweet! I bet it brought up a lot of feelings inside you.", "You guys sound like you have a solid relationship. It's always great to find those little pieces from the early days.", "Did you get her number?", "Good man, I have a lot of respect for that.", "That sounds like quite the checklist. I'm glad you brought the beer you might need it haha!", "Well I bet you're going to have a great time. With that haul I don't see how you couldn't!", "I should have, but last time my girlfriend did that the police ignored it. I was so angry.", "I do, and I couldn't fathom how someone could do that. I wanted to hop off the bus and yell at the guy.", "How come? And was it a pain to replace it?", "I hope he did a good job!", "Awesome, I'm glad to hear that. Sometimes it's hard to find contractors with good reputation.", "I think my parents found them expensive, otherwise I can't think of any other good reason. To be honest, I kind of envied my friends.", "In that case, I feel much better haha.", "Unimaginably hard. But once I got into it I couldn't stop. I'm feeling pretty certain that I'll hit my 5km goal in no time.", "I used to be that guy too. If I can do it, you can do it.", "That's cool. Man, those tiny disks were easy to lose. what game?", "That's awesome. I get nostalgic about old games as well. ", "That sounds horrible, Did you wash it or throw it away?", "That is a really rough story, You should make him pay for another one.", "Thankfully he is. He's doing much better, but the thought still shakes me scared to this day.", "Yeah he did. He's on meds and he sees a therapist every week!", "Oh no! Was it a fun night? ", "Oh heck! That had to be really scary for them! glad you're okay though! ", "Aww, that sounds interesting!  Are you in touch with many people from high school?", "I get that.  It's weird when I forget the name of someone I knew for years.", "Poor thing!  Is he felling better now?  I hope he quit that diet.", "Thank god he is ok.  There are very dangerous diets around, better be guided by his doctor.", "Were you nervous?", "That's awesome.  I'm glad he did so well.", "That's lovely! I love waking up to awesome texts.", "That's so wonderful to hear.", "How did that make you feel?", "I bet. I'm not great at being away from my boyfriend.", "Just talking to more people in general. For example, at a convention I was volunteering at. ", "It's called Otakuthon. It celebrates Japanese culture, anime and videogames. I was with MSI and I was just so surprised with my improvement.", "That's such a sweet thing to do.", "Dogs are probably my favorite pet. Maybe I should take up volunteering for a dog shelter one day.", "November of 2017. Almost a year ago. ", "Never really listened to XXX but Peep's music really resonated with me.", "I love puppies! But they definitely are a lot of work in terms of their hair.", "I understand. Our puppy sheds a ton too and he isnt even that hairy of a dog", "Oh my, that sounds like an absolute blast!", "Did you stay for long? That would be a great vacation. ", "What a great time! Is the cottage on a lake?", "Sounds like heaven!", "Oh no! Did you get in trouble?", "Aww, I'm sorry. Hope that teacher learned a lesson ", "It's wonderful peace of mind to find someone you can trust with your fur babies! Did you have a nice trip?", "Aw, that was so nice! I'd love to find a cat sitter like that!", "How did it go? What'd you get him for a gift?", "It seems like all those years just flew by, huh. At least now he's getting old enough to start remembering all these great times!", "Are you feeling zapped from the week?", "I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you don't have to work through the weekend!", "It never ends does it? I hope you keep your head above water though, it's all you got sometimes!", "I feel that pain. Do you not have the motivation or just dont know what to do?", "I get that. Well if I could give any advice it would be make sure you have proper form over anything. Dont worry about heavy weight if your form is garbage.", "Sure. I love working out. ", "How much pain are you on a scale of 1-10?", "Dang that sounds bad! I know you might be frightened of going but I think you should go. You'll be better off for it.", "That was nice of them! I bet you felt really cool hanging with them. How did it go?", "That is awesome! I love festivals, they're always great to unwind and even just walk around talking to people.", "Oh no! You must've felt ashamed. did you return it?", "Hopefully they were understanding that it was accidental?", "Well I will find out tomorrow. I know better than that is what she told me, especially on Fridays, when we are the busiest. ", "I agree. I feel so bad and embarrassed about it. Even the doctor scolded me. ", "I agree. I guess I will weigh my options, its just im getting old and watn to start a family too, so I dont know.", "Thank you for that! You just made my day!", "Yeah. I want to stay true to my beliefs, but she made some very valid points. ", "I will do research about her theories and then make really think about sticking to my beliefs. ", "Wow that sounds scary. Did you make good friends?", "Yes it can be really helpful! I went to school 3 hours from my home and it was still hard to meet new people", "Oh, that must have been a hard thing to do. I'd hate to be the one to deliver such a bad news...", "So sad...that makes me want to cry, too, just hearing about her reaction.", "I get to visit about once a year. I always wish that I knew who lived there now so I could see the inside of the house.", "A little, but mostly I love seeing all the things that are the same.", "Oh no :( Can you tell me? It's okay if it's too private.", "Oh my gosh I'm so sorry that really sucks. :( Can you talk to the professor and try to make it up or find out what you did wrong?", "Good luck to you! I wish you all the best <3", "Oh no why would they do such a thing", "Definitely doesn't excuse what they did.", "That's not cool. I bet it felt awkward.", "You are a stand up person!", "Well, my family was here, too.  Toddlers don't make life quiet, but they make me feel fulfilled.", "Full of meaning.", "It definitely was, so I ended up skipping it.", "I regretted skipping the meeting a little bit, but probably not as much as if I'd gone to it.", "Oh really, were you supposed to tell them?", "You can never be to sure now a days, they might post your secret to social media.", "Did you ace your test?", "I always worry when I have to take tests. Unfortunately, I am horrible with tests. I am glad you aced it!", "Nice, what a legend and a gentleman", "Word, you should ask him what the secret is", "That kind of cold disregard for someone you're supposed to love is totally alien to me, the guilt would destroy me.", "Yeah Freud called it Projection, it's too bad people tend to hide their true natures so well.", "It's awful! I know so many families are dealing with similar situation. Sometimes we don't know how to help someone close to us. Heart breaking...", "You can't help him until he wants to really change. Sometimes all you can do is pray.", "Did she feel bad and apologize after she realized what you had done?", "It's good to get to spend time with those you love. I am happy for you.", "That's inspiring, has that worked for you in the past in the same way?", "That's so cool, you seem very intuitive", "That sounds frightening. Did you get home safely?", "Why were you walking so late at night?", "Nice, what are some things you realized?", "You don't have me yet <3", "oh god, how did you . have the courage to even go outside?", "that sounds like an adventurous day ", "Wow, how could they do that?", "Someone's gotta put an end to that poor service!", "You should. No matter what you can't lie to your Mom. It will always come back on you.", "Come clean and fix it. It will make you feel better.", "Nice! Do you have any superpowers?", "I like your confidence! Fighting!", "oh nice, what kind of memories?", "how does this make you feel like?", "That's awesome! You're going to be rolling in the dough with those skills", "That's exciting. How long have you been learning programming?", "an interesting one, what does this make you feel ?", "oh did he say anything afterwards? what happend next?", "That is so kind of you, I also a have a soft heart for animals.  I happen to be a dog person, but I do have a cat that was my ex boyfriends.  ", "I can't say I have had any mean dogs as of yet.  My favorite breed is  a pitbull.   THey are so loyal  and sweet although  lots of people claim they are mean and vicious .", "where are you going!", "thats awesome i hope you have a good time with her", "Wow, that must've been disappointing.", "Oh! So close. Just to think about that missed opportunity.", "Yeah, it's like time passes but the smells and everything stays the same", "Yup, and I feel there's a part of us that is eternal as well", "I think I would leave if I saw something like that.", "Did you tell someone about it so they could take care of it?", "It seems most responsible to alert someone to clean it.", "I feel that way sometimes when I check my bank account, how's school going?", "Word, college is tough, wishing you the best", "no i was the one who was upset with him", "PROGRAMMING!", "Good for you!  I hope it does not stress you out, though.", "That is good.  Money is no good if you are not healthy enough to enjoy it.", "Dang, how fast did you run away?", "Did you tell him how creepy he is lol", "Well more of my old best friend. I have not seen her i a long time.We went through alot together. It was nostalgic to me. ", "I agree! We have alot of things to catch up on. ", "It's not fair, eh. Having to suppress those feelings day in and day out is significantly harder than the mundane work itself. At least it's comforting know that most everyone feels the same? ", "Maybe if we weren't so attached to being creatures of comfort. Some things we just can't let go of, wouldn't exist without some poor shmuck having to do the dirty work. I guess we're all that shmuck to someone, someway or another.", "Oh wow, what ovie was it and how did it make you feel? ", "oh wow that sounds very emotional, I think I would have needed a bucket to catch all my tears. ", "I liked my friend very much and believed that he can not talk negatively about me", "May be you are right. But sometimes, you go with your heart not with the law. Murphy's law may not work in every situation.", "Oh no, I am sorry to hear that. How is she doing and how are you holding up? ", "That is great that she has such a great support group and loving family members to support her. I hope she gets well soon! :)", "Oh no, maybe buy her a new cake to make it up to her!", "Yes there is! Maybe throw in a cupcake too, I am sure she will forgive you in a heart beat! I know I would. :) ", "I am so happy for you! Why have you been apart for the past two weeks?", "Awesome to hear that you'll get to live with your loved one soon", "Oh no what happened, are you alright? ", "Oh no that must have been a terrible experience, I hope no one got hurt from the shattered glass.", "I actually gave more effort this semester, so I will continue to do goo and hope to get into nursing school next year.", "I agree. Im planning and hopping things go well.", "It sounds like you're quite the organized person!", "I'm the same way a lot of the time. It's really a good way to avoid any unnecessary disasters.", "That is so exciting! Best of luck to you man! I doubt she would reject such a great guy like you. :) ", "That is great, I would also be surprised if she said no to a man like you! ", "no, i don't believe that, whether you are having a bad day or not if you look at everything clearly you will see there is a next stage, just like birth death is a process", "Not necessarily,  while it's true you have your traditional christian or Muslim that preach the afterlife as some miracle and hell, scaring people into not being themselves, but death isn't a scary phase, and i don't care about whether i am going to die, as that is just the ego trying to cling on and survive, i've passed that point, but after looking clearly you'll see there is more than just this dimension and that is just a simple fact, science tells us this too, it's not about feeling good or feeling comfortable with death, it's about growing ", "Yeah, 70s were incredible, the dancing the cars, the women had style and the music was incredible.", "But we got to make the best of it, pretty soon elon musk will release flying cars and then life will be amazing again.", "Congratulations on your success! I bet you worked incredible hard to achieve your goals.", "There will always be people that are jealous of your success, but it is up to you to be the bigger person and handle it with grace.", "No I didnt purchase insurance. When i saw it my blood was boiling!", "yeah. Im so upset i cant even think right nowl", "I agree, but im praying they will take care of him. hes just a puppy.", "Yeah thats all i can ask for.", "OH no! Are you the jealous type?", "OH man! Yeah I would of felt the same way!", "oh no do you feel ready for it? ", "That is great, I believe that you will do amazing! ", "Oh that sounds really annoying. maybe you can look it up online or get someone to help?", "Oh I see, well good luck to you, I hope you'll solve it soon.", "That is great, what has been going on in your life recently?", "That is good, sometimes that is all you really need to do, get things done  one step at a time :) ", "They looked really exciting! Does it make you want to play it again?", "If it makes you happy then you should do it! Capitalize on that nostalgic feeling while you can.", "That is always frustrating. What happened?", "Wow, some people are just terrible! I hate when people don't take responsibility for their actions.", "He got caught cheating by his teacher on a test the other day.", "Probably because he did not study enough so was unprepared.", "I bought a sandwich and after a few bite I noticed that there was a bunch of mold.", "I was!", "it really was its just so scary but I had to believe the experience and caring nature of the midwives would get my through it and it did.  I really admire anyone in that career, its not just a job but a vocation.", "Indeed.  The really do work with life and death everyday.", "I know how hard diets are to stick to. What foods are you avoiding?", "Don't be too hard on yourself, it's hard to quit something immediately. Just keep trying, I believe in you!", "I get it. There is always another meal to start making the change!", "Why not? What happens tomorrow?", "Don't let it worry you too much. Just make sure you organize everything you need to present and remember to speak loudly and clearly! You can do it!", "That sounds creepy! Is there any chance someone could start escorting you to your car? There is strength in numbers!", "I definitely recommend getting some mace and a pocket knife. Stay safe out there!", "I hope that all goes well. I am sure he will be good as new after!", "I am sure the procedure will go excellently.", "I agree! I was amazed with her performance. She did really well.", "I hope so. She is very talented. Who would have known. ", "Well the day came and off we travelled.  We arrived at the place only to find all our friends and family there to cheer us on.  Up we went in the plane and of course while the lovely instructors tried to reassure me the whole time, i tried desperately to keep my breakfast down!  However after the nerves and initial panic when we jumped out, it was actually one of the most amazing experiences of my life!", "It certainly did.  I would definitely recommend it.  My husband though is another story.  He has a fear of the sea and underwater so you can just guess what I will be buying him for his next big birthday haha.", "Yeah and its the last one before I graduate! I can be more thankful for his generosity. ", "Thanks for the kind words. I cant be more happy and excited to be done!", "Yes!  I laughed and sometimes cried a bit reading through those, especially from some old friends that are no longer with here.  It even brought up some great memories of prom and our school leaving party.", "Indeed.  It definitely made my clear out day much more enjoyable.", "I agree! She will take care of it. I have faith she will bring it back the way she got it! lol", "Yeah it does. I never let anybody drive my car, but I felt I could let her since she is responsible. ", "Im sure that is tough.  You must really miss him.", "Do you get nervous being on your own?", "Oh that sounds even tougher.  It is a long time but I hope it flies by for you and your hubby is back home again.", "Im sure your not though! ", "Well yes.  While i was in my daze, absolutely horrified, my level headed husband did all the practical things like contact the police and insurance company etc.", "Thankfully the insurance company sorted my out with a courtesy car for now but still cant believe there are people out there that do such terrible things!", "true but in time I finally did see that its not the end of the world, its just a car that can be replaced but that initial overwhelming feeling was awful.", "Me too! I get so frusterated because there are no back roads to my house so I have to go through this for the next 2 weeks. ", "Me too, so i wouldn't have to deal with wasted time!", "Yes it was. I cant wait for our reunion so we can catch up on more!", "Yes the things we remember and ponder about are the greatest!", "I didnt think I was but he has won my heart.  No one claimed him, even after posters being put around so yes he has officially become part of the family.  To be honest I was glad no owner came forward, I would never have wanted to give him up in the end he has just stolen my heart!", "Just as he does to us.", "Oh wow, that must've been a hard situation. Especially later when you were more in control again.", "That sounds like a good decision. Good luck!", "What's happening this weekend? I hope you have some good things planned.", "That's awesome! I'm very excited for you this is a good event for you!", "That's interesting. Are you okay?", "That's bad news. I hope that everyone is healthy and doing well.", "Why what happened?", "Oh sounds scary!  I would have been scared.", "oh yes she has, it was a while ago now but at the time the guilt was awful.  Needless to say I learnt my lesson and never borrowed her clothes again!", "Yes just a pity I had to learn the hard way.", "Im going back to school full time. I was there for more than 10 years. I will miss everyone. ", "Yeah just thinking about it makes me want to tear up. ", "I was gonna explode. Im so fed up with him. Im so done.", "He doesnt know I know, but he will soon when i throw his stuff out", "Aww- I'm sorry that happened. Why were you embarrassed?", "It's always difficult when you feel self-conscious - but I've learned that people rarely judge you as hard as you judge yourself. ", "Please try to be kinder to yourself! You are a great person- with a lot to offer. Always remember to be good to yourself.", "Your trustful person?", "Oh, How much did you like him", "That's horrible! I'm a parent and I could never take money from my child. Did you confront him?", "How frustrating! Keep your head held high and be strong. One day you'll be able to keep him from taking your money.", "That's really nice, however, to keep the marriage fresh and strong, I think it's important for you to have outside friends.", "Haha, well I do know the feeling. I guess if it works for you, then don't change anything.", "what did you do???", "well im sure you'll get over it. nobody should make fun of our mothers", "stay hopeful! , they'll release it sooner or later", "it's all gonna be fine and you'll get what u want.", "That is so sweet. It is wonderful to have things that bring back these beautiful memories. ", "That really does make it special. I'm glad you have that. ", "....what feelings? what are you talking about", "oh man, that's rough to hear from someone older than you. is she ok?", "That doesn't sound very good, but jealousy is a hard thing to deal with", "Other people deserve to have things, too.", "Oh no! When that happens you have to get up and yell, \"Safe!\"", "Awww, well it happens to everyone sometimes. Just try to forget it. ", "eh not really. what about you", "and what does that mean practically? what will you do differently?", "i love walking in nature. hiking is a great way to exercise and to explore the outdoors", "Oh it's always sad when someone you care about leaves. Can you at least keep in contact with him?", "I know. It is hard to say goodbye to people but he is doing a wonderful thing at least. ", "Everything is going to be okay. Try to relax. ", "If there is something in particular, try to deal with it head on. ", "that is great.. may i know what you have learnt", "it is challenging i guess.. best wishes that you developed skill over it", "great day to you too", "How hard have you been studying? Exams are extreme amounts of mental crunch time!", "You sound very confident! I wish I had your confidence when I was in school.", "art design", "thank you! i have a freelaning job at art already but i just want the qualifcation for more, maybe your daughter can do the same thing", "Good for you. Being prepared is always better than the alternative.", "Don't get too cocky but enjoy your victory you deserve it.", "Oh no! You must feel really bad. Are you able to fix the problem?", "Please try not to be so hard on yourself! We all make mistakes.", "Why do you need to go to the doctor?", "Oh that's terrible. Did they take care of it?", "That sounds very uncomfortable. Were you honest with them about your change of plans?", "Right. ", "Oh I bet that was amazing! I have a memory of going to a waterfall with my parents when I was young and it's a nice thing to think back on. Does your daughter remember it?", "One day she'll look back and it will mean so much to her! Memories with parents are the best ones.", "I totally understand, I hate carnival rides too, they always feel so rickety. Do you have a particular one you fear the most?", "Agreed, a good theme park is nice because you know they have high safety standards, but those carnival ones scare the crap out of me.", "Oh my goodness! That sounds awful! Was this recently?", "I'm so sorry to hear that. Hopefully he has a good team of doctors that figure out what is going on. Are y'all able to visit him?", "That's so scary!  You must have strong intuition", "I'm so glad you came out of it okay.  I hate driving in bad weather and reckless driving just makes it worse.", "It was nice of you to at least think of it. I'm sure she wasn't that upset.", "It's totally understandable. Life can get really busy sometimes!", "Oh, that's not good. Did you get a warranty for the phone?", "I'm sorry to hear that. I hope that everything works out for you.", "Did the other dog provoke him? I wouldn't stress it too much, its just natural behavior for them, take him to training school.", "Oh then yeah, invest in a trainer. I love dogs a lot but an aggressive dog is very dangerous.", "Oh I'm so sorry but I bet that was very special of you to find.", "I would definitely make digital copies and upload to a cloud or a disk in case something happens.", "That's awesome!  Congratulations!", "Nice choice!  Getting a B is definitely something to celebrate", "That's exciting!  There's nothing like listening to your favorite music with great headphones", "I agree 100%.  Sounds like it's time to start downloading some new tunes to test out!", "Oh thats heartbreaking, do you guys already have children?", "I really hope she gets better too, it must be terrible to know you cant have any kids. You're a good man for helping her cope.", "Young love, it's such a bittersweet quest.", "I know right? I wish I was young again sometimes.", "It's always difficult losing a pet.  I'm sure you had a flood of positive memories and sadness than they're gone", "You just have to remember what a good life she had with you!", "It's my first time living in a small town. I love the fresh air. I have also met some great people.", "Either that, or people are just nosier and love getting into each other's business! Just kidding. I think the slower pace of life just makes people nicer.", "That's a blessing.  I know a lot of people didn't have a mom like that.", "Is there anything she does specifically for her?", "I'm sorry. I know how that feels. Did you study really hard?", "Oh, okay. Maybe you should ask your teacher for some extra help or find a study buddy. i hope you do better next time.", "That's sweet! I have a great husband too! How long have you been married?", "That's great! We've been married for almost 10 years and I still feel like a newlywed. It's great when you marry your best friend.", "No, I just trusted him. But I wrote all his details in my phone just in case. ", "Yeah but the car was on the highway and I could not get out. Thankfully everything was alright. Never again though!", "I usually love the trips down memory lane, but the sad side of it are the ones who are no longer around. I'm sorry.", "I'm right there with you. It makes you shed a tear sometimes too.", "Oh. I know lying is sometimes beneficial in some situations. Hopefully you did this to protect someone's feelings", "Yeah, I think that means you have a conscience, which is a good thing. If you didn't feel bad, I'd worry about you!", "That would make a funny video! We have a super friendly, playful cat too.", "Yes, they are. He is my daughter's best friend.

", "Oh man heart breaker. Thats good yall are friends though. You never know maybe one day yall will be married", "you dont still have any feelings at all for her?", "Ooh, I've always wanted to learn how to do that. You must be so excited!", "Omg, that would be awesome. I might just have to learn how to do that myself.", "Ooo! That's exciting! Congrats on your baby! I hope your guests enjoy their time. ", "Yay! That sounds like so much fun. Baby showers are a great way to bring everyone together.", "Usually it will let you know if something is wrong. Part of how we are designed! ", "It is, everything has to be balanced just right, or else we feel it.", "Oh no, how did you make things right with the manager. I am sure he is just wanting to get paid. ", "That is a tough spot to be in, maybe you could of washed dishes for him. Or give him your phone for collateral. ", "That is good, such an embarrassing situation to be in.", "Oh man I want that too! did you get it?", "Do you use your computer?", "How much do they go for?", "thats not bad. I have a rx 280 ", "Moving, is always such a pain. Did it go smoothly at least?", "That's good, glad he wasn't having too tough a time.", "Oh man, I can't stand barking dogs. I wish owners would do something to shut them up. ", "That can make it so hard to sleep at night. ", "Aw man, childhood is full of good memories! I love the smell of strawberries. ", "Haha, clearly strawberry. Sounds like you had an enjoyable childhood! ", "Your neighbor doesn't do anything about his dogs?", "If it were me, I'd call the animal shelter and report possible abuse since the dog does nothing but bark all day - poor thing just needs attention and the owner isn't taking care of it.", "Really depends on the person I think. You can't have good people without bad people.", "Agreed!", "You are very lucky my friend. There are so many children out there that cannot say the same, sadly. But so happy for you!", "I guess it all comes down to karma, if you believe in that stuff...... I do. :)", "what did you end up doing?", "It's good to have a partner. ", "I have a son, it's definitely nice to have some peace and quiet.", "You must have been very happy when they returned home.", "Did you get it?", "That's disappointing. I feel sorry for you. ", "That sounds like a bummer. Hopefully, you did not lose too much.", "Yeah, but it is a good thing to hear you did not lose too much. Some people put all the money on the line.", "Hey, that's awesome! I hope you get it. When do you hear?", "Well I hope you do. What kind of job is it?", "You must have been relieved you were able to help. Did all go as plan?", "That's awesome! I'm glad it went through without a hitch!", "Oh, that's terrific! What a great feeling that is, to be appreciated and valued!", "Oh, I love that you are so happy for her! You sound like such a supportive and loving partner!", "I also have two older puppies, training takes time and care and love.", "Puppies are smart believe it or not, use treats and don't yell or punish for their mistakes. A change of tone and placing them outside works really well.", "i remember the lite brite toy. it was a nice toy to have.", "i agree, the toys now days are made cheaply and of poor quality. everything is about video games. ", "Moving can be stressful for sure, hopefully you had some help?", "It's like christmas! only you already know whats in the boxes. the best part about moving is you can have a fresh start on organization. ", "That's not good!  What did you do to try to get him to listen again?", "I bet that worked!", "Oh man, i'm about to eat dinner over here! lol that's pretty gross. My cat pukes up stuff all the time so i can kind of relate.", "I bet, hope the dog is feeling better though.", "interesting, what was the issue?", "oh man, that is an issue, i hope he grows out of it", "I bet you cant wait.  WHere are going for your vacation?", "Miami sounds like a great place to go for a vacation.   I wish I was going with you!", "That sucks! What were they upset about?", "It sounds like a very challenging environment to work in.", "That's exciting! When will she be moving in?", "Does she live far away?", "That sounds very frustrating.", "Hopefully you'll able to get it all sorted out soon.  I'm sure when it's done it'll be a beautiful house.", "What happened?", "I've never tried VR, but just imagining that is scaring me away from it.", "Congrats!  How exciting for you.", "That's a long time to hold out hope.  I bet you were shocked.", "It always takes time. Hang in there It will all work out.", "I bet so too!  Good luck to you both.", "What subject did you choose?", "Nice choice. I guess you have good relationship with your brother.", "why was the officer yelling at her?", "wow, that's unfortunate. i would feel embarrassed for the lady", "That's so wonderful. I love being cared for when I am ill.", "It is an amazing thing to have a loving mother. Everyone should show more appreciation to their moms.", "Sorry about that, you could have taken a taxi", "good enough you got home safe", "Did you have a good childhood? You must miss a lot of things.", "Yes. Nostalgia is unavoidable when we look back on our youth.", "That's unfortunate. But at least you learned from the experience, right?", "No need to feel ashamed. We all make mistakes and at least you learned your lesson.", "That's nice that you helped him. I'm sure he appreciated it!", "Yes, it really does. I am sure if you get sick, he will remember and do the same for you!", "Wow! Were you hurt? Was anyone else hurt?", "That's good news at least. I hope you are feeling better now. And don't be hard on yourself, accidents happen.", "Yes - this is m child's first year and it was pretty difficult for me to let someone take care of him instead of me. You know how it is! Parent life.", "Yes!  I'm already enjoying it!  How are you doing?", "Well, I was parked pretty close and a guy came up to ask me for gas money!  There was a gas station a small walk away though!", "I didn't have any cash on me.  He got out of a vehicle that had two other guys in it...staring at me!", "I wanted to run and hide.  I haven't' worn a dress since.  ", "Oh it did.  I learned my lesson.", "I go to church every Sunday I love it.", "The people you can meet are super.", "That", "That is really not thing. I wish more people would do such nice thing. I know that made your day.", "So you don't like to be alone. I am so sorry that affects you. So what would you do? ", "Yes, usually when one relocates it's hard to make new friends, but eventually it will happen.", "That was really nice of your old friends.", "Happy birthday. What was your favorite gift?", "Nice. What brand of shoes were they?", "That's terrible. Were you able to identify the kid?", "I'm glad he was able to catch him.", "It was just sad. I love Paul Walker and his movies. I still remember hearing about him passing away in the same way he became famous. In a fast car.", "Oh he did!  I think the one about candy cane and the truck driver was my favorite. I can't remember the name.", "Are they twins?!", "Awww! Twins seem like a handful but also very exciting at the same time!", "Oh, I'm sorry. What happened?", "I can imagine that you did want to run and hide. Sometimes husbands get us into all kinds of situations.", "I've been in that situation before. Did she find out about it? ", "Well that's all that matters. If she was okay with it. I'm sure she was happy watching the episodes with you, even if you had already watched them. ", "That sounds like a bit of work. Are you adjusting to your place now?", "That's what's most important. I'm glad everything has gone well.", "Oh, I'm sorry. Why didn't you get to go with him?", "Oh, that's too bad. I know exactly how you feel. Hopefully your husband will watch your son another night so you can go have some fun. ", "Was it a lot of fun?", "That's great, but you don't have to wear a fancy dress to be beautiful. I'm sure you're gorgeous no matter what you wear!", "It's ok, just try your best to remind yourself how beautiful you are and practice self-care as a habit.", "What a great feeling! You must love your dog.", "She sounds like a great companion.", "Yes. I have all my binders ready with paper and a calendar to keep track of stuff.  I'm nervous but ready!", "I hope so!  It's very different from undergraduate", "He keeps screwing up my prescription!  I've needed it for a week now but they keep sending it to the wrong place or use the wrong name", "Me too.  ", "I can't play those kinds of games. Too spooky for me.", "That would keep me up at night.", "Oh my gosh that's insane. Well, I'm sure you'll be able to control your impulses in the future. ", "I've been there before too. The important thing to remember is that there is always another chance to make it right tomorrow. ", "Aww, sounds like he is teaching the puppy. That's so sweet.", "Yeah, sounds like a pretty smart pup.", "I do understand, I have a son myself. You just need to be patient and continue trying.", "That is awesome. I am proud of him ", "gotta risk it for the biscuit", " i feel ya but sometimes temptation is good gets the heart pumping", "It can be nerve wrecking. I'm sure you will do fine, though! Have confidence!", "You know they say, imagine them in their underwear...I wonder that really works. I'm not fond of public speaking either.", "Yes, I feel like I worked really hard and I put in so many hours. I guess it was not good enough. :(", "Thank you for your great advice my friend!", "Nice! Enjoy it! I like living alone. It is so peaceful! I get lonely somtimes but for the most part it is great!", "Yeah, but they are all just a phone call away. Keep your head up, your girlfriend will be there soon!", "Oh I know, mine too! I love how all the colors change with the setting sun.", "It reminds you of how beautiful life is.", "Wow, that's rude! He won't last long...", "Yeah, some nerve on that guy. He should be grateful to have a job!", "Oh wow! Congrats!! How exciting!! How far along is she?", "LOL Right!!! It's way too hot to be pregnant right now!", "You are so awesome!!! I wish I had  sister like you when I was pregnant.", "I've been in that situation before!  It can be scary", "I'm glad it worked out in the end!  I wish people would be more careful with their dogs.", "Oh, no. Did you take it back or keep it", "The store might not take it back at this point if it has been to long. ", "That sounds beautiful! What emotions did they bring out of you?", "I'm sorry! What a lovely memory to have of her though. It's good to still have things in your life that remind you of her.", "Oh no! That's so sad. I'm so sorry, I know you must feel like crap.", "I understand completely. I have things of my grandfather's that I can never replace.", "Sweet! Where did you go?", "That would be awesome to have the whole lake to yourself! My guess is the weather was nice too if you guys got to use the boat most days!", "I've had similar experiences.  What do you end up doing?", "Have you ever had a positive experience from that cycle?", "oh no! hope all is well with your dog.", "Good to read. Always great to find a vet you can trust. Looks like you did. ", "BBQ sounds so good right now! How was it?", "Well that's kind of disappointing. It's always a let down when you go out and it isn't is good as you were hoping.", "i completely agree. though, i'm remote so i am never sitting in the same room as others so i can distract myself ;)", "lol. it kinda is. i moved about 3 hours south of my office a few years ago and since even at the office my work involves connecting to remote data centers it hasn't changed my job any. ", "That's terrible! What did you do?", "That's good. I'm glad your alright.", "Oh no! That's so sad. You must've been so upset. ", "Hopefully you didn't and hopefully the other kids didn't make fun of you", "What kind of car was it?", "Oh I bet! My husband wants an older car when we can afford it", "OH NO! I would be devastated. Did he pass, or missing?", "I am so sorry. I am sure you are. I would be devastated if I was in your shoes. Does she have a chip? Maybe someone will get her to a vet office.", "Good job! How do you think you did on it?", "That is a good feeling. Time to celebrate before the grind starts all over!", "Yeah I like going straight to the point too", "I like when I get places earlier than expected", "I understand that completely! Did you have to get any work done?", "That sounds scary! I always avoid going to the dentist until I absolutely have to. I know that's pretty bad!", "Oh no! I hate when that happens. Was he afraid or just didn't want to sleep?", "Ugh, that's the worst. That happens a lot with my son as well. Hopefully he wasn't too cranky today!", "That is wonderful! You must be happy, shows that he is getting bigger, soon it will be college ", "College is when the tear will start to flow. I love children.", "That will be fun. What a great way to relax and unwind", "I saw the weather forecast. We only have a 20% chance of rain so you know how it is here. We'll be good.", "That must be hard to do, he wants to be beside you. He is going to miss you.", "Yes he needs to so you would have to ignore him at nights.", "That is so sweet. What is her name?", "I can just imagine she sleeps in your bed sometimes. I love dogs, I would like to have a dog someday.", "That is very cute, the little one probably couldn't hold its bladder as long. ", "That was very smart of him, maybe he remembers back to his puppy days.", "That's good. How is it going?", "That's great news! It sounds like he is enjoying his new freedom, and was ready for it. ", "I'm glad you didn't hit the dog!  Did he jump out at you suddenly?", "I live out in a rural area where people don't always have control of their dogs.  Sometimes those little ankle-biting dogs will start chasing the car and they make a break for the car and it makes one really fearful that you'll hit them.", "lol, guess you were pretty hungry", "yeah, might wanna go replace it", "That sounds amazing. What's your favorite beach to go to?", "Those are the best. Especially the white sand crystal clear water beaches.", "i sure it was beautiful", "really, i wouldve never thought that. i have a friend who is in Dubai on a teaching assignment", "yuck, how gross!!", "lol right, they could easily be your neighbors dinner", "Oh my gosh, I am so sorry for your family.", "I'm sure she can with all the technology and modern medicine now. She's got this!!", "why do you live so far from family", "i would like a new life. i totally understand", "what? that scary", "wow, a hard lesson", "I understand!  I live in the country and have the same problem.", "Yes.  The only company available out here is Century Link and they just crash randomly all the time.", "That is very cool. What took you all around the world? What was your favourite place?", "What interesting stories you must have! I think that would be really neat, but settling down is probably good too. ", "That is so sad.  I hate it when pets die.", "yes.  they do like to have lots of  babies", "WOW im so jealous! You lucky dog.", "I have heard the same. Are you going with anyone else?", "I want to be your friend!", "Congrats! Did you do it because of football season?", "Cool! Whats your favoirite? I like the office.", "I have never heard of Mr. Robot actually.", "Same here! I am glad you are doing well! :)", "I hope these feelings last for you!", "I am not sure yet. I already have 4 dogs. I want to because he is so cute!", "Yeah, lol true!", "Well I'm sure he will be, most guys are. I'd never get to  do anything if my girlfriend didn't trust me.", "Everyone gets jealous, It when you act on unfounded stuff that is the issue.", "Yes sometimes people do stick their noses in where they do not belong", "Yes.  Especially men who want to mansplain things to you.", "Wow!  How much did he win?", "That is awesome that he gave it away!  Maybe good karma will let him win again.", "Good choice. You could have broken down and never made it to school.", "HAHA! You are super lucky you are smart. Lol", "Everyone handles stress differently. My anxiety gets so High I sometimes cancel my plans.", "I go to a psychiatrist and take meds, It just fixes what your body doesn't make, or do properly. It helps so much. ", "Oh no! It will be ok. It seems everyone in life has to go through that at least once. Everyone gets through it!", "Sometimes you need those times to make your realize how special having a job is. Gives you perspective.", "I hope everything is fine, How did it turn out?", "Im happy to hear that, a sick child is always a scary thing.", "Neat. Where are you going?", "Sounds exciting. Have fun.", "Oh wow, are you feeling super envious?", "Ha ha, I don't blame you! Hopefully you can get the car you want soon though.", "I 'm glad to here it will be fine , but what was wrong with it?", "I 'm glad you was able to pin point the problem and I hope he stays in good health.", "Wow, that's so mean of them to laugh at you! At least someone pointed it out eventually, right? ", "That's embarrasing. But hey, I think the best way to get over moments like those is to just laugh at yourself! Don't beat yourself up for it. ", "Wonderful I bet she is really content if everything is perfect. Love to hear that someone is doing well.", "I understand but try not to be jealous. Good things will come to you to in its own time", "The waiting must be very difficult and nerve wracking.", "Things like that make me antsy.", "A new haircut can do wonders! I always feel like a million bucks after.", "I bet you looked great! Those compliments would've made me feel good too!", "Oh? What specifically were you talking to her about?", "Haha! Well, as we mature, we learn so much more about ourselves.", "Haha you are a good father. I hope you can make it through it!", "Oh my gosh! I'm sorry! haha Thats funny. Atleast you have them a story to always remember.;)", "Oh no! So what did you do?!", "That's nice of your neighbor! Your boyfriend should've told you that there was no toothpaste earlier. Maybe there would've been time to get some. But at least you didn't go to work with stinky breath, right?", "Haha everyone has to do that once. Can you tell me a great story about the party?", "Hahaha thats funny. I hope you guys are still on good terms. To be honest little holes sounds like an easy fix.", "Wow, cool. Maybe you can ask to tag along?", "That's too bad. Well, at least you have something to work towards and plan as a goal for yourself.", "That's amazing! How old is she?", "Wow, that must've been a big thing for both of you.", "I am sorry I do not know what nclex is but I wish you good luck", "O ok I hope that everything works out for you ", "Wow! Did you try to get it out?", "That's amazing! He probably loves you so much", "Do you feel nice and refreshed though?", "I did the same thing today, so you are not alone in your behavior friend!", "Oh no! Did it break?", "Oh, that really stinks. I hope you were able to get another one.", "Did you do some neat doctor stuff on it?", "Oh yea that sounds like you did a good job!", "That is good, how long did it take before you go him to this point?", "Yeah i understand, it is good that you took him there though", "Wow they must be doing well. Why dont you try to get one?", "sounds wasteful to me. life isnt about material things anyway. ", "It really hurt my feelings. I wish he would've handled it better. I'm more disappointed in him lashing out rather than what he said.", "I told him I was disappointed in his actions, but I still love him. We all make mistakes.", "Ugh my neighbors do that sometimes. It's the worst! I think some things should not be allowed to be cooked unless you live alone.", "Ick. Hopefully the smell is fully gone now", "Oh that is the worst feeling! I hate using the restroom in public as is. ", "Maybe.  For me I just don't want to cause a stranger to be embarassed lol", "I am with you, i like it a lot more than summer personally", "I feel that, I hate being hot. In the winter I can be comfy and I can always just put on a jacket if I get too cold, but in the summer it is not that easy.", "I was very nervous. I did not know if I would pass or not.", "Did you pass the test?", "Yeah, and it seems so hard to make money these days, at least for me. Maybe I should move to the city where there are more opportunities.", "Yeah, you are right my friend. :)", "I'm assuming that he/she didn't return it in time. I'm sorry.", "Oh, I understand. Did it bring it to you at all?", "That is amazing!  I'm really happy for you!", "It sounds like you really deserve it!", "that does sound terrifying , are you feeling better ?", "at least your ok, thank god for that", "Nice, for what position", "That's pretty great, you must really take the initiative.  Good job", "You're much braver than me. I would never host a dinner party.. don't feel like I'm good at planning, and don't feel like I'm interesting enough to talk to a bunch of different people.", "I think, maybe, yeah! It depends on who's there, and if I felt comfortable with the host. If I felt like I had enough people to kind of \"rescue me\" and who I could talk to at the party if I got anxious and couldn't talk to strangers, then that'd be alright. Other than that, I just kind of do like maybe a group of 4, max", "Yes, she didn't even get mad. I still felt so guilty about it though. ", "Honestly that is such a wonderful idea!", "I am right there with you!  God is good and wow, He's been with me through so much hardship.  I'm so happy you feel the same way.", "Yes, we can always count on Him to know the bigger picture and have faith that He's working for our good.  Hope you have a blessed day!", "They really have changed. I know exactly how you feel and love thinking back to the time.", "Those were awesome! My favorite was the coke commercial at Christmas time. So many memories!", "Oh fun!  How big was it about?  Did it have neat markings on it?", "I think I saw someone post a picture of those online. Maybe it was a lunar moth! What a fun experience!", "What is your nieces name?", "That's amazing, was it your sisters first baby?", "Yes! I just went to the local nursery and they had so many plants to choose from. I made sure to only choose the ones that had some kind of fragrant smell. I am dreaming of all the flower arrangements I will make next year.", "Thanks!! :)", "That sounds like the perfect remedy for feeling down. Getting out in the sun and outside the house/bed is so good.  I'm sorry you're struggling with depression.  I understand.", "I am so glad!  You know what to do to help your body and mind and that is good self-care.  I try to do that as well as meditate and pray in the morning.  Really refocuses me.  I'm glad you're feeling better!", "I imagine, are you prepared for it?", "Oh yes, last year with huracan Irma we went without power for 5 days.", "Aw, did it bring back a lot of good memories for you?", "That's awesome. Sometimes I wish I could be back in my childhood. Maybe if only for a day. ha ha.", "I am sure it'll be ok. Usually if you stay in contact with them and don't blow them off for a long time it will be OK.", "I would call them. They usually give you some credit for that.", "That's good. I assume you have studied hard and are prepared?", "Good luck! You will do great!", "Haha, I'm sorry but I had a little laugh at that. It reminded me of the time I did that to my teacher in school. I was embarrassed, but it made me feel better to find out that it seems like it's a common thing that happens, since they're female authority figures that you can easily mix up.", "Yeah, she knew what you meant. She probably forgot in two minutes, while you've thought about it for much longer. The best thing to do there is to just show off your sense of humor and ability to make fun of yourself and not take yourself too seriously, which it sounds like maybe you did.", "Well they are actually my pet pigeons. They are the beautiful white ones with a fan tail. But they sometimes like to come inside to see if they can munch on anything.", "No better I just put some screen on my windows, lol.", "I sure wish it wasn't. I live far from my family and they can't even make time for me to go to them. So I feel for you, it is very sad.", "Absolutely first. Especially when you don't live close.", "I bet it wasn't Comcast! They wouldn't even give you a cup of water for free.", "I am glad you had a nice experience! Its difficult to find such a company that cares about its customers!", "Oh, wow! That is crazy, have you talked to the vet?", "I thought it would be normal. Good thing to be cautious. ", "Well it is a good thing you unplugged everything!", "That is a good lesson to learn early, I am glad everything turned out okay for you!", "That sounds amazing!  But terrifying too lol", "I admire you!  I don't think you'll regret getting this experience", "Yes, they demanded to know where we got the money to buy all that candy. We lied and said it was from a birthday party at school. Haha", "Yes, heehee......", "nice, what system do you play on?", "i really enjoy video games as well", "That's the worst! Have you tried talking to your neighbor?", "You might try contacting the authorities, though I don't know if it would help. ", "It really was! It brought back so many wonderful and touching memories.", "He really did. It made me happy.", "He mostly speaks French, and although I understand it perfectly I have trouble speaking. In the end it went well, and he was super easy-going and made me feel like family.", "We are! Every time I come over, we drink a lot of different beers together. It's how we bond!", "Good job! Do you feel pretty prepared?", "WOWZA! Congrats! Is it a job you can build a career out of.", "Oh thats good! Thanks for teaching. :)", "My mom is one so i know how important you guys are.", "Man.. i need some of that luck!", "Wow thats awesome! i never win anything like that", "I agree! I wish I was able to make things", "For sure you are born with those types of talents!", "That is cool! I love flash backs from the past especially when it comes to television. I sometimes watch old shows on youtube that I used to watch as a kid. Love it!", "I used to watch the Wonder Years after school. I love watching it until this very day. ", "that must have been embarrassing, I hope you weren't to traumatized", "that is good to hear, it was a motivation to succeed, a great character building ", "Aw man that sucks. It must have been a crazy storm.", "How big was it?", "Yes you are right but it is hard to not think about it when there is so much death going on around the world and we have to hear about it through the media.", "You are right my friend! Thanks!", "That is a good test of friendship.  Did he keep his word?", "It is such a blessing to have good friends on whom you can depend.  ", "Nice! I hope you get it, I'll cross my fingers for you also! Do you think you got a good chance?", "That's all you can do, but if you worked hard, I'm sure you will get it!", "Oh cool. Were there any good picture in there?", "Well that's nice. I am glad they were happy memories for you. ", "Oh boy.  I've gotten quite a few of those before.  New hairstylist?", "That's odd.  I would've told him so and asked for my money back. ", "first i did not know what it was, than i realized it was a fly, i was about to throw up", "i know, flies are filthy creatures  and plus they produce maggots, yuck", "5", "is there anything that you can do to help prepare yourself?", "yeah i can understand that!! id want to get it over with too. the sooner the better", "Oh my, I hope that doesn't mean more workload for you.", "Maybe you should ask for overtime pay just in case you do get more work!", "Yeah, flying can be scary.", "Hopefully it isn't a long flight.", "thats awesome that you trust her", "its hard to find good people you can trust with your kids nowadays", "Oh no! Thats horrible. Were you driving?", "Oh Gosh that is horrible. I am so sorry that happened to you.", "That's the worst! Because now you'll be freaking out trying to think of the things you may not even remember whether or not could have been there. That must be an anxious feeling. ", "Yeah, I'm not quite a hoarder or a packrat when it comes to those things, but I do get sentimental with some physical objects. If I lost them, I'd feel like it would be an itch I couldn't scratch, because I couldn't replace what I lost. Hopefully you can work past it somehow.", "Oh man, thats the best feeling in the world. Getting out of a shower especially if its into clean freshly laundered sheets.", "It's such a wonderful feeling, I should take a shower soon too.", "How did you you go over your budget?", "I hope you can have better self-control in the future.", "awww. that is good news!", "how long has it been seen youve seen each other?", "Oh gosg. Do you have some greedy roommates or something?", "Hahahaa good point. Maybe try hiding your groceries.", "yea i have", "thats great, happy for yo", "literally me right now actually", "must be nice to have someone that loves you", "What is going on with your work?", "You can do better next time I believe in you!", "Ouch.  Why? ", "Oh I see.  Very interesting that your faith makes you want to die though.", "its not so bad, it can be intimidating but you just need to figure out the campus layout and classes but its very smooth from there", "once you figure the way it just becomes routine", "no, i just came up with this philosophy while facing an existential dilemma ", "No, i study it in my free time", "Yes, I feel that every day.", "I wish people understood how precious life really is.", "Why did you throw your laptop?", "Sometimes I lose my temper like that too.", "wow thats vivid, what game was this?", "ah yes league, love hate relationship with that game but after 4 years it can really still tilt me more and more", "Oh no, I hope it wasn't an important meeting.", "Sorry to hear that, were they understanding about it?", "I'm sorry your wife is sick.  What kind of soup is it?", "That sounds quite delicious if I must say.", "Yeah.  reminds me of the good old days!  ", "Yeah same here.  I remember one time awhile back I took some pictures of when the aliens landed in my backyard.   That was some good times!", "Yikes, that's a tough one and I can definitely feel your pain on the job market. I think either network your way to a higher pay job (depends on connections) or possibly go back to school to a doctorate or certain specialist degrees.", "Yes but the market is quite flooded with CS degree holders. It's hard to get something unless you are specialized I think.

Just bring some headphones and listen to some comforting music.", "You have to be more careful next time, maybe you need a calendar to remind you.", "I am so sorry to hear, I am glad that it didn't cause a lasting effect.", "That is a fantastic feeling. I hope you get it.", "Keep riding that confidence. It will get you places. It sounds like you deserve it.", "That must have been a bit scary, You should have called the police.", "You cannot be too careful these days, i am so sorry that happened to you.", "Okay! Now that is interested, I would love to see them.", "Oh really? I will be checking it out. I would love to have some.", "Free? That makes it even better, I will be getting me some posters.", "I hope so too. Thank you so much!", "I am afraid of spiders. I would run and scream.

And thank you about our dog.", "Oh no,  what happened?", "That is terrible, you must have been devastated,  I hope he find the help he/she needs.", "Oh dear, but are you allowed to sing at work? That must be so annoying.", "He needs to just sing in the shower. Tell him to quit singing.", "Haha no way, I thought that only happens in cartoons!", "I'm sorry but I probably would have, too. Hopefully you didn't get hurt though!", "That is unfortunate, is he doing any chemotherapy ?", "Well I hope everything works out for him!", "What were you waiting for!", "Nice!  The anticipation must have been killing you!", "Oh it worked fine, but when I pulled my laundry out it surprised me how the smell of that soap reminded me of my life all those years ago when I used it regularly. Isn't it weird how scents can do that?", "Right? I didn't expect that could happen with laundry soap!", "o no what did you do?", "o no im not sure that was the best response", "Oh No! Did you get hurt?", "I bet that was a little embarrassing. ", "Don't be embarrassed. You know that you had a problem and you are better now for it", "That's understandable.

I'm happy for her but part of me was also a little envious, I hate to admit.", "Well good, I don't feel so bad about it then. I thought I was being a bad friend!", "That was probably not a good idea, how did it go for you?", "Well, you never know if you can do something till you try. I am glad you were able to do so well.", "That can be kind of scary. How did it go?", "Awesome, congratulations! It just goes to show how great things can happen when you're prepared.", "Good job.

Possibly the early 2000's at the earliest! Crazy, I didn't know that they still exist either!", "I loved that too!", "That is wonderful to hear, good for you. There's way too much craziness in the world making people unhappy. It's nice to hear someone is doing well and happy.", "Distancing yourself from the negative things sounds like a totally healthy way to insulate yourself from that stuff.", "Aw, that must have brought up a lot of nostalgia for you. ", "Did you share it with anyone else?", "Nice, a step up is always such a relief. Do you feel confident you'll get the job?", "Well I hope you get it. Good luck!", "That's great.

I am sure you did better than you think.", "That is a good attitude. Better luck next time!", "I was doing the same thing!  Hard work but so satisfying when you see the results!  Who is coming to stay?", "I completely agree.  Mine can get trashed in 10 minutes flat from the kids.  ha ha. Oh, how fun!  I hope you have a wonderful time!  Yeah, you'll probably be cleaning all over again by the end of it but its worth it.", "That sounds pretty disturbing.  Have you called the cops?", "I bet.  I wonder what he is thinking.", "I certainly hope so,  Why do you want to move?", "That sounds great, That is how I like my houses to be too.", "Hmm, don't you need fat and protein in your diet also?", "Oh I hadn't even thought of avocado. Well good luck with the diet, I hope it works for you!", "Oh wow! That is a brave thing to do! Your letter must have been a little intense if you are worried how they will take it. How did it work out?", "Awe that is great! I am glad there was a happy ending!", "Oh man I'd be mad too...you should wait outside with a paintball gun ", "Yup gotta lay down the law", "It turned out to be the sump pump, I guess it was old. But yes, it scared the daylights out of me!", "I did, yeah. It was actually still in working condition but I couldn't stand the sound and I'm a light sleeper. No more scary noises at 3am!", "Oops. I hate when that happens. Did they say anything to you?", "That was really nice of you to apologize like that. Some people would have just ignored it. I know that could have been embarrassing.", "that sounds exciting! Do you bike a lot?", "Doesn't sound corny. We all need a hobby to relieve stress!", "How come you can't take them anymore?", "Awww, well maybe you'll have grandchildren that you can take one day!", "That's intense. I hope you did well!", "Congratulations! That's great news. Well deserved", "I totally understand. The same thing happened to me last week. I thought I was going to lose it!", "Right, I had to end up calling the homeowners association on them", "Right? I wasn't even mad about it, I was astounded by his ingenuity.", "Well he also taught himself how to use a toilet so who knows!", "That is great! Hopefully he continues to be", "Lol i'm sure you have to put up with him as well so its even", "Oh no. That's so sad. Was she sick for long?", "I'm sorry. At least she had a good long life.", "That is awful! Did you have insurance to cover everything?", "Yeah that is horrible. I am sorry that happened to you. ", "Oh no! I hope you didn't get into too much trouble by doing so!", "To be fair, everybody makes mistakes and it's bound to happen even to the best of us!", "I just came back from it! I'm actually still a little intoxicated. I must say it was a lot of fun, we celebrated my birthday and I felt very loved and happy.", "Thank you so very much! I appreciate the sentiment.", "She was a little sad and surprised, but we had been talking about threesomes for a long time now so she understood. Regardless, I felt very ashamed the next day.", "She already has. We both think of these type of things so all is good.", "That sounds like some nice relaxing quality time", "Have you ever passed out together watching tv?", "How old is your baby?", "And how long have you been married?", "that is exciting! will it be your first house?", "that is no good! hopefully yall will find a better one", "It was good, he (the dog) seemed really happy when I got back. He said that he let my dog out a bunch and even took him to the park!", "Absolutely. He has proved himself to be trustworthy when it comes to important stuff.", "Oh no, what did you do?", "Don't worry, from what you said it doesn't sound like you almost ruined it. It wasn't something on purpose at least.", "Yeah I had a few hints. My expectations were somewhat true; my brother's friend celebrated not only my birthday party, but two other birthdays today. It was wonderful!", "It really was. I was so happy!", "Haha caught red handed!", "Yeah, I wonder what their bathrooms are like if that's their service", "Lmao. It's actually my junior year of mech engineering.", "Thanks lol. I wish I could type this well at 6 years old.", "Did he try to get another diploma in this profession area?", "That is a good news. I hope he get it.", "Surgery on my kids always scares me but I have heard that it is best to have them taken out while they are young", "I understand, when it comes to our kids and being worried about them it feels like time stand still", "Oh for sure. I hate having to cook and do dishes after a long hard day", "Were at work today or doing something else?", "Interesting. How do you feel about it? Do you find it fun and interesting, or wish she were more responsible with her money?", "Yeah, I can understand that. Sometimes when you're not in a position to enjoy yourself because you're busy being tied down with responsibilities, it's easy to get mad at others. Whatever you can do to spin it positively, I would suggest that. Being negative about it will only make everyone's lives worse.", "Oh my gosh!  That had to be super scary!", "Yeah, thank god you are safe.  I don't know what I would have done if that happened to me.", "He was talking about my other friend who is a bit annoying sometimes. While I may agree I just don't like talking behind someones back.", "Yeah I feel like not everyone is as moral as me. But that's pretentious which is ironically amoral.", "Sounds like your co workers respect you then", "Or that as well ha", "Did you ever get caught?", "Was she disappointed?", "It was actually only a week--but he wasn't showing signs of being physically ready was the problem. Thankfully, I'd already had my bags packed for weeks so we went to the hospital ready!", "In the end, yes--growing too big is actually his problem now!", "whatwas the exam for?", "tha is really cool what was your grade", "What are they arguing about?", "That's so ridiculous!"]
