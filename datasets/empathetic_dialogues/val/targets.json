What happened that made you look bad?", "Oof yea that seems like it might take a few years or 10 before you can laugh at it but at least its over.", "That's awesome! My experience was quite opposite as I sat waiting in the dentist chair for a 2 1/2 hour procedure!", "Yes! I'm actually glad it's over :) So, how long did it take you to fix the computer problem?", "Yeah, that is pretty annoying to have happen.", "Good man! That is your money and they just wanna snatch from you.", "It sounds like you're happy for her, which is commendable given you didn't get hired. Were you very disappointed?", "That's always tough.

Does he have to travel a lot for work?", "Maybe one day if you have the time, you can pay him a surprise visit.", "That is good. Where you running late", "That sucks. I hate when I am running late I always feel behind", "I don't think you should feel bad, you didn't know!", "I'm sure he will be okay. Maybe you can make it up to him.", "Sounds like a good idea.", "Aw. Children will make us do things we NEVER thought we would (or could) do!", "That is SO exciting! Congratulations!

It takes determation to succeed", "So if not by studying ,what else?", "That must have hurt a lot.Did you go to the hospital?", "You are very accident prone.You should get an insurance right away.", "That is so true.

If I were your cat I'd be embarrassed too! Lol", "That is a hilarious intro, thank you for that! So were you worried that your girlfriend found someone else humorous?

Until the end of your story.. then I laughed so hard I cried. But that is so relatable. I've been terrified of my own shadow more than once.", "That's hilarious, But I also feel bad for you. Perhaps there is a way to calm yourself down after you watch a scary movie?", "Haha hey I would sneak into my parents bed even as a teenager when I was scared, especially during storms.", "I'm supposed to wait for you to start. :)", "You haven't said anything yet other than asking why I hadn't responded.

So Im in the same boat.", "That is so annoying.Who he thinks he is???", "I would be scared of a guy like that.", "Aww... sorry to hear that. I haven't personally seen the show.

Maybe it will help", "Are you trying to go out and meet some ladies", "That is the first step. What you have to do next is be at your best behavior always", "Do you work in the tech industry? You could always take a class.", "There's ton's online, and knowing more about computers can really help any profession.", "I am sure it is something disgusting. Do you have someone do it around you", "You can just let him know you are not comfortable with it", "yes the patient is very ill", "oh that is really a bad news i heared", "What is it that you would like to share with me?

My power just went out awhile ago.", "Yes it makes me pretty upset to be honest.", "My brother used to have a yo-yo! He did a trick called Around the world and also one called The cradle. Know those?", "Oh yeah! I remember that! I wasn't good at doing any of them. I mostly just watched him. Good memories.", "Oh man I would have terrified I hate being up so high. He sounds really brave!", "Did he go on anymore after that?", "Well he's young, so you can't really fault him.", "That's good.

You must have taught him well.", "Oh man, that's so nerve-wracking. Do you think you guys will be a good fit?", "Then it sounds like at least he has some perspective and ability to know not to overreact. I guess you could say you lucked out, but that may be me speaking too prematurely", "I hope you make it. Thats a big birthday.", "That not good. Maybe she will understand if you just can't make it.", "Wow... That would be one of my worst fears. How did they even manage to do that?", "Wow! Any way they can get out? Did they call someone?", "I know it is hard to start letting go, but it gets easier with time.  Don't worry, you are not alone.", "Yeah, they always seem to come back!  You just have to love them from afar for  a while.", "That's really sweet. We don't have gas station attendants here. But that's nice that they're that helpful.", "Ohh, that makes sense. Yeah, then that's really nice of them! And really sweet of her to offer a tip. I guess there's good in the world after all.", "I would absolutely be scared too. Good news or bad, I would be a worried wreck beforehand. Have you gotten it checked out yet?", "I'm so glad to hear it was good news, though!", "Thats great of you.

What did you end up naming your son?", "I am greatly looking towards starting a family with my wife as well. George is such a nice name.", "I have - but not for anything that severe. Are you suffering any side effects of the stroke?", "Yup - I know that feeling. And it's always so hard falling asleep in those uncomfortable beds with an IV in your arm.", "That really sucks man. Are you planning on looking for a new one?", "Well, as long as you're doing something you enjoy, that's all that really matters.", "Have you figured out what's the problem?", "Sounds like maybe one of the legs on the table is bent?", "Yes? thats so cute, but you have to be carefull not to say bad words in fron of them", "OMG, well it is a bad thing but now you can be more polite in front of them, and also when you are not with them!", "Are you keeping it as a souvenir?", "Nice, I do that sometimes with movie tickets if it's a great movie that I enjoed a lot.", "I've been camping a few times - the proximity to others makes me feel stuffy too.

How long did you guys stay?", "Oh no, What happened?", "Oh yea? Where are you guys? In the mountains? Camping?", "Lakes are awesome. A body of water around here is pretty far. How long are you guys staying?", "Did you get anything extra, like a bonus or a trip.", "Great. What business is it?", "I can tell where this is going.", "That has never happened to me. Thank god!", "Well does that make you anxious?", "Oh, that would be rough. I've been through that too.", "Are you happy for him?", "But if is a great opportunity for him, you should be happy.", "That's very nice of the friend. What sort of problem was it?", "Bah, those newfangled computers. It's nice to have a tech saavy friend.", "Why do you think they do that?", "That's not fair and probably very frustrating for you. You need to say something to them.", "Oh man, I can't even imagine. I lived in Kansas for a while and we had a storm that did a lot of damage. Took out the power all day and stuff. Nature can be so devastating sometimes.", "Jeeeze, yea, it's totally understandable to be afraid. Has it been good there otherwise?", "It's awesome to hear that! I guess no place can ever be perfect though. Here's hoping we both can live long, happy, and fulfilling lives!", "That must be so disappointing. Is there something else you can do to have fun?", "Sounds like you really like the water. So what do you do now?", "Wow! I've never been anywhere near there.", "I've been to the ocean a few times but I've never even seen a surfer. We had a small boogie board.", "I live in Tennessee", "Wow. I must have a boring life then, because I have only seen tug boats and barges on the Mississippi.", "Oh no! How come?", "Oh well maybe she has a lot of problems internally. You never know how someone's home life is like.", "Aw well it's likely bipolar- I know a phew. They have a hard time even on meds.", "I would save some and maybe get something you need/want?", "For sure! Any extra money is always good!", "Had she done that to you before?", "What a shame!", "Congratulations!", "Oh man! I wish work stress would make me lose weight lol. I gain! Are you looking for a new job?", "Oh I don't deal with that well. I hope you get a new boss!", "Wow, what brand", "That is a nice car", "Yeah all the time. I get so jealous", "Wow, that is hard to do. Congratulations my dude!", "That sounds awesome!  Is Elbert a fourteener?", "Hahaha.  Well, I hope you don't get sick.

I bet that was a relief.", "Wow, that should have been amazing", "Me too, I love chocolate", "I've always been too scared to do a backflip. I always worry I'm going to break my neck or something. Did it take him a long time to get it right?And did he get hurt?", "Oh, that makes sense. And I'm glad to hear that. I always worry about that sort of thing. You ever think about trying to do it netx?", "Are you sick?", "That sucks, I will pray for you.", "Oh my, that must've been an embarrassing situation!", "That's ok, you did the right thing. It probably happens to lots of people.", "Yes, what about it?", "That was nice of him.", "Tell me all about it.", "I try to always go for extra sleep.", "Wow! 30th is a big milestone birthday! I can imagine that everyone was excited to get to share that with you.", "Did you feel old after?", "That had to be relief. So now you won't have to deal with that frustration again.", "Those keyboard shortcuts can be lifesavers.", "Thats good. Everyone isnt so fortunate.", "Its goof to have support when it does change.", "Exactly", "We would all be better people then", "oh wow.

Why was that?", "Do you normally feel like that when you fly?", "I can understand that, flying is scary.", "I'm glad you didn't get hurt.", "Hey, do you have anything on your mind?", "I agree, incompetent customer support is one of the worst things when dealing with such problems.", "oh I am so sorry for your loss.", "I bet. You gave him a good long life, that was the best you could do.", "I am sorry it was so stressful", "Just hope for the best", "ugh thats the worst right.. everyone should have holidays off.", "I say skip work next time :p go for it", "i just love that, my son knows ASL", "i wish schools would teach kids asl", "she wants to spend time with you", "that was nice of her", "its a beautiful place", "in that case i agree then", "Where are you going on vacation?", "That is close for me, but it is a fun time!", "i admire that", "no its not", "I see, have you tried yoga and meditation?", "Keep a positive mindset and your anxieties will be relieved!", "Oh my, you must have very surprised!", "It must have been an enjoyable day.

Maybe your son should give it a try.", "Twitch is just a place where people stream themselves playing video games.  I guess a lot of people really love watching good players.

You are very lucky to have made it out without any property damage though.", "Thats amazing, you must be a good person", "How many kids do you have?", "Sometimes i like to not have other people asking things of me.

The months off for summer is nice though.", "Why would you do that?", "So, why didn't you just pay for them your self?", "Sorry to hear that.. Why were you alone?", "I hear you.. Socialize, get new friends.. You will start adapting", "Oh dear lord.. Was he sick or something?", "haha.. Sorry, i couldn't help but picturize it.", "Oh no, what happened?", "Holy.. What did they want?", "I see.. Any specific reason for that?", "It is really good to have that level of discipline", "Same here.  It helps make cooking go smoother.", "Agreed.  No sense wasting time while cooking by looking for odds and ends.", "i bet you did.. Felt nostalgic huh?", "that is really innocent and sweet of you my friend", "Aww.. Did you used to go as a family to the beach?", "Such a sweet story.. So happy just to hear that from you", "WOW!! She is my absolute favorite!", "So true.  I was so jealous of brad pitt over the years", "Aw.. sorry about that my friend. Have you made any friends?", "So true.. family is everything!", "Oh no, what did he do?", "Aww, you got to admit that is so cute as well", "That is really sweet my friend. It is nice to see old friends", "Aw, i am missing my high school now that you said it", "Haha. Do you love sports cars that much?", "Such passion for cars. Wish you can buy one soon mate", "How much better did it pay?", "That is not too much, I think you made a good choice", "Sorry to hear that my friend. Why did you move?", "I see.. Dont worry, you will own your new city soon enough", "I am sorry to hear that, why did you move there?", "I am sorry to hear that, why did you move there?", "Did you end up buying anything?", "Well is it close to where you live? That would be cool to go back often", "that is a good tactic actually, it boosts your confidence", "Very true. We should believe in ourselves for others to do that", "Oh my god, sorry to hear that my friend.. Were you guys close?", "How sad.. Find peace knowing that she is in heaven now", "what did she get sick off , im sorry to hear that your a great to your wife", "When i get married i want to be like you , and take care of my loved one", "That sounds tough.  How do you think you did?", "Me, too--I'm sorrry you had to go through that.  At least it's over now, right?", "Maybe they know a friend who knows a friend.", "Yep, that's the way of the world, especially with Universities to.", "A duplicate? Like a fake?", "That  sucks.  I'd be very upset.      You have to be careful who you order from online.  Some times if the price is too goot to be true its a fake product.", "Oh no that is so frustrating! What did you do?", "Ah yes, a glass of wine might help to make that feel better. Still, what a pain. Lousy end to a lousy day.", "I would be so lost without my phone, but I could make it through an evening. The house keys though!", "Was it some fraudulent transaction posted on your account?", "So, it was your partner who used you card", "Oh no! Was anyone hurt?", "That's pretty scary.  Did the boar survive the ordeal?", "Are you willing to go on another safari?", "I'm not surprised.", "That's very intense. I am sorry you had to experience that.", "That's good. Time heals all wounds and can be a powerful cure to pain and disdain.", "You are telling me you are a hoarder?", "Everyone is nostalgic one way or another.You are fine", "Oh my goodness! Thats terrible. Did anyone see? My face would be bright red.", "I'm sure this will be one of those times where you cringe when you think back on it! I'm sure you made those guy's days though", "That's crazy! I'm glad there was nothing there.", "Some horror movies are so great that they make you consider your own environment.", "That's great. I bet it was wonderful experience.", "That's cool. Taking that experience into the next phase will be pivotal.", "I am sorry to hear that.Did you get hurt.", "Do you have full cover?", "Where did this happen?! Were there any other people with you?", "Did it happen while you were in the store? I hope that your kids did not see anything too disturbing.", "Oh that is pretty cool. What did you think?", "Yeah, we were blissfully unaware of the real world in those days. It must have been nice to reminisce.", "That has got to feel good!  You must feel very happy and relaxed!", "Cherish this time you have, because you never know when it could change!", "What restaurant is it for?", "Sounds good. I love mom n pop restaurants. So much better than big popular restaurants.", "That sounds really interesting. Were there any good matches?", "Well at least you are putting yourself out there. A lot of people give up on finding love.", "Oh no, I hate cavities. Are you brushing your teeth eVeryday?", "Dang, that sucks. I hope you can find a solution for that", "Wow, you must be proud! He might cure cancer next!", "Geniuses don't do chores my friend.", "I'm so sorry to hear about your mom. It's good that you're at peace with it, though.", "But a part of her is still here in you.", "They left you all alone? I bet you feel lonely...", "I know that feeling. I like to keep the TV on to drown out the silence", "Whoever ate it all is evil!!!", "I know right. I would be so furious!", "I would do it! Try to be calm about it at first and see how he responds.", "Yeah, something should be done about it!", "I've done that before when I was just annoyed with them. Don't feel bad!", "Who cares! I always like to think of satisfying myself first before others!", "Oh no! That's a smelly situation to be in. What did you end up doing to fix it?", "What a pain! I bet that cost a fortune. Did they end up repairing all the portions of yard that they had to rip up?", "That must have been a great reunion! Who was happier, him or you?", "He was lucky to have you waiting there for him!", "Ugh, I hate when unexpected expenses arise.", "Well, that was nice of them. I hope you take them out to dinner after you pay them back.", "Wow, great for her! I am confused as to how you ended up GAINING though!", "Well, keep at it and you will get where you want to be. It really just comes down to how many calories you take in vs. how many calories you burn per day.", "Please tell me you won a lot of money.", "lol That's how I would of reacted too. One hundred dollars can buy you a lot of stuff.", "OH NO! That's infuriating. Did the stain come out?", "Hopefully they remember", "Did you brush it right out?", "Maybe you could give them a call on the phone and tell them about your feelings?", "You could go to the party. And then learn how to swim!", "Yea, and you can bring some water toys to play with!", "Awesome! I bet you felt proud at what you accomplished. Did you have this goal in mind for a while?", "How much total weight did you lose, and how long did it take?", "Thats awesome.  I wish I could go.  Where are you going?", "Cruises are awesome.  You get to eat as much food as you want.  You'll probably put on like 10 pounds", "Aww man, I hope you brought your raincoat.", "That's good, you don't want to get soaked and catch a cold.", "That's amazing. You must have been so surprised and happy!", "Did you get a video of it?", "Gee, he must have been really hungry! That's a lot of eggs!", "Wow.. that's unbelievable. I wonder how his cholesterol is.", "Oh dang, that really sucks. I can't believe TSA would go that far, it must've been super embarrassing.", "Dude, you should definitely report it someone or the company because you could probably get something out of it.", "Oh yeah, what was it called? I really love roller coasters!", "I saw that one on TV. It looks absolutely nuts. I hope to visit Cedar Point one day!", "Oh, I hope you get some good news. I am sure it would help you getting aid for college.", "All you can do is be patient and see what happens. I am sure everything will work out for you.", "That's awesome. I hope it works out for your friend and their fiancee. Are you excited to be there?", "Well I am sure they appreciate you being a part of their big day. Enjoy the after party!", "Wow, that sounds fun. What type of artwork did you see?", "Gee, she must have her hands full! I hope she does well as an artist!", "Did you feel very emasculated by this?", "Yeah, I can see that viewpoint as well. She may end up carrying you to bed next time!", "I'm glad he returned home safe and sound. Did he have fun on the camping trip?", "My mom was the same way. It's all part of being a parent. I hope to have kids soon too and I worry about stuff concerning them myself!", "Oh wow, I bet the emotions of that came back to you.", "Yes, those memories are what make life so special.", "So, not a surprise, but still nice to get?", "That's sweet.", "Wow, thats very admirable of you.  People who abuse animals are the worst kind of people.", "I have 2 dogs myself and I could never imagine hurting them.  I can't believe there are people out there who think that that is ok. its sick.", "Yeah those were the days. When we had no worries in the world.", "That sounds really cool. I always wanted a treehouse but never had a good tree for it.", "Oh yeah, why is that?", "I would have them towed!", "Oh so you have to have a sign up to legally tow them?", "Or you could just park behind them so that they would have to knock on your door before you let them out.", "That's awesome. Which Disney park did you go to?", "Ooh I live pretty close to it. You have a great husband to give you that treat!", "That's good that you found happiness. That's what were all in the pursuit of right?", "You are blessed. Make sure to spread the positive energy.", "that's great that you can trust her.  how old?", "That's great. Be thankful, some people aren't so lucky.", "what did you almost buy?", "It's hard to find good quality at walmart", "I would try target.  good quality stuff there.", "try googling it, and read thru the reviews", "Finding a buyer can be tough.  You have a good agent?", "Does it have a good location?  You know the only rule of real estate, right?  Location, Location, Location.", "Sounds good.  Definitely should target a family buyer then", "You got a figure in mind for your house or are you letting the agent handle that as well?", "Thats never good when you have a bad manager.  What made them so bad?", "Know it alls are the worst.  Hopefully you are in a better spot now, with a manager who cares.", "Oh no! What's wrong with your dad?", "Aw, I'm so sorry to hear that. It's not easy to watch our parents age.", "We can surely hope!", "That must have made you feel terrible. Were you able to find the dog?", "I sincerely hope you can find him! But I bet your neighbor will understand it was just a mistake and you didn't do it on purpose.", "Doesn't he understand that people have to go to work in the morning?", "You might have to file a noise complaint with the police.", "What is causing you to question whether it's the right thing for you or not?", "Yeah, I've done that as well.  It can definitely be a hard job, considering dealing with the public, hours during holiday seasons, etc.. But sometimes if the pay is good, it can outweigh some of the negatives.", "lol that remind me of a movie i saw with robert deniro , thats absolutly bizzare by the way but cool at the same time", "wow , i would love to have a cat like yours", "Aww thats too bad that no one else could go.  What concert was it?", "haha that must have been a crazy concert!", "Sometimes that depends on the industry. If she works in ones that have high turnover it's not a big of a deal as, say, an administrative job", "Well, I'm not entirely sure about the banking side but I wonder what she's looking for. Perhaps a small vs big bank culture", "OOO I love doing that, but not so much the upheaval in the midst of it.  What room are you going to be working on?", "Still, a new color can definitely brighten up a space and make it feel all new!", "That's awesome!  I wish I could wake up that way every morning.  Did something specific make you feel that way?", "Ha!!  Well I've woken up from a dream and been mad at my husband because of something he did in my dream - I guess it can go the other way too!", "I've done that before... I enjoyed it too! I love looking back at old pictures and stuff", "Some of it but my grandma did save a lot.  I plan on doing that with my kids", "I love cheese too! What kind of cheese was it?", "Gouda is great! Do you like prosciutto too?", "Aww poor baby, hopefully shes doing fine now.", "That's great to hear. You have one tough cat.", "Ha, I used to do that too. But I was almost always disappointed by the toy once I actually got it.", "True! McDonald's was my first job when I was 14 and I remember being stoked I could now collect ALL the toys even if I didn't play with them!", "Did they tell you when you may hear back from them?", "I pray they get in touch with you soon and that's is an affirmative on the job!  I know  how nerve-wracking waiting can be though - I hope you get it!", "Arghhhhhhhhh! I soooo feel for you and have been there. Have y'all had the chance to talk about it? (Or do you even want to?)", "I hear you. Maybe humor might help? Like okay, so *this* is awkward....can we talk about that email? Heartfelt apologies go a long way, and even if she doesn't respond -- you'll feel better for trying.", "Are you sure they didnt bring the wrong bill?", "I would have complained.", "Ohh, I feel sorry for you", "Ohh, that's bad. You can always skype your family!", "Yes, I feel you. Cleaning sucks, but after all that hard work, the results are amazing!", "Me too! You seem just like me!", "That sounds very exciting! What kind of planning did you put into such an achievement?", "That's so cool! I wish you the very best and hope that the blood sweat and tears turns into happiness, joy and fun times!", "Are there any other family members out there that could help her?", "Wow, I hope that she was able to work things out. Not the best way to start living somewhere far from home, but I'm sure she figured something out.", "That's great! I am happy for you!", "Yeah, and they are paying you good enough. You are a luckiest person!", "i honestly have never gone to jury duty , but im sure it was still a pain to put it on your schedule", "same thing i heard too , really long and boring being there against your will", "I am so sorry to hear that. I have been devastated by the loss of pets in the past, so I can understand what you're going through. I'm sure she was very loved and had a great life with you and your family.", "Aww that's great! What breed?", "Oh no! that sounds so scary. was everything ok?", "Good I'm glad to hear that.  That's a long time.  Hospitals scare me, I can't imagine being there for that long", "I'm so sorry to hear that! Hopefully he or she wasn't in too much pain at the end.", "Oh my gosh that's horrible. I hope they caught the person who hit her!", "oh man, that's gross! at least it was vomit and not something else.", "how many cats do have?", "Aw, I am so sorry. How long did you have your dog for?", "They say dogs are mans best friend.", "What kind of dog was he?", "Nice, I have an australian shepherd. He follows me around everywhere.", "Oh no. That's terrible. I lost my dad five years ago, I know how terrible that feels.", "Neither did we. He seemed so healthy, and then within weeks he was so sick he couldn't even talk. I miss him every day,", "surprise gifts are always fun.", "that sounds like a well deserved plan.", "Oh man, I can relate, that feeling of anxiety before you get there really turns around when you get caught up in the moment", "Life is full of experiences like that, they seem scary from the outside, but once you relax you get swept away", "that sounds prettty bad!", "I cannot imagine if something like that happens to me. I would be trying very hard to find it.", "Sometimes by remembering all the places that you have been in the past two days can help. I will try that!", "I agree completely it is an embarrassment to the parents you would think.", "The frustration they go through well at least we don't have to take the kids or parents home.", "What store were you at?", "Could you get a rain check? That is a bummer?", "Aw man, I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to make you feel better?", "Ice cream cake is my favorite! I'm glad you're feeling better haha. You have a really nice co-worker.", "That's really awesome! She sounds like a great person to work with.", "Oh, I know how that goes. My husband loves sweets, but if it is just sitting there and no one is eating it It will get eaten right then. Getting another would depend on how much he likes sweets and needs them. lol", "That's probably what I would do also. It won't kill him to wait another day.", "Oh I hate when that happens. we go to self checkout to avoid things like slow lines.", "Hopefully the person learned what they had to do so they don't hold the line up in the future.", "Oh man, that must have hurt. Did she know you had feelings for her?", "Sounds like your friend broke bro code, that was kind of scummy.", "Wow! What a nice friend. I wish my friends did that", "That's great. It's nice to have people so close to you. It really helps in bad times", "That must of been a proud moment for you as a father.  She's all grown up and out in the real world now", "That's awesome, she'll have a great time and learn a lot i'm sure!", "Wow! What are you gonna do with the winnings?", "Bills do take up a lot, don't they.", "Oh my gosh! thats funny.  was that the only thing that made you think it was haunted?", "How did you discover exactly what it was?", "Roller coasters are scary for me. How was it for you?", "I'm the same way haha. But how was it fun if you have your eyes closed the whole time?!", "I am so sorry to hear that. I'm sure she was very happy while she was alive with you guys.", "You went through a lot of losses.", "That sounds painful, I hope you were okay after your fall.", "Yeah i bet that was really embarrassing, but I'm glad you're okay.", "Oh boy!  That's always a nail biter waiting to hear back and it seems like they love to take the full amount of time before they let you know. Did you get it?!!", "Amazing! Congratulation! Prayer is always a good thing to do! That is so incredible.  Are you enjoying the job?", "I remember those times. Did you get what you wanted?", "The super nintendo is a classic. What is your favorite game?", "Oh no! I'm so sorry!  I would feel the same way but you just have to think...who cares what others think!  If they can't have compassion for an accident then something is wrong with them.  Did you get hurt?", "I bet they didn't.  I like to look at experiences as part of our journey and teaches us to have compassion for others in similar situations.  So glad you're alright! Hope you own a helmet!", "How'd the hurricane go?", "Thank goodness. Hurricanes are no joke.", "Was he okay?", "Well maybe if you do it a little more then he will be fine with it. I would be afraid just because he is afraid.", "Maybe so. It's good he has a good home now.", "I bet he is. Don't worry", "That is a great idea", "Saving money is important", "That's amazing! You must be so proud.", "She's also a hard worker.", "That was very sweet they don't have to actually do that.", "Good to know there is still kind people in the world.", "That's awesome! Who were they from?", "That was really sweet of him, maybe he just wanted you to know you're loved.", "You can never be too prepared! I am sure you have got everything.", "That was very smart thinking on your part. Have fun on your trip!", "We all do things we regret when drinking", "Thats usually how it goes", "You definitely took a leap of faith there. How'd it go?", "hahaha I definitely admire your courage to have done that.", "I wish you luck", "I am sure you will meet them", "That's disappointing. What happened? Did he just not do anything?", "I would have been disappointed, too.", "Oh no that is a total bummer. It's especially common in the summer months.", "Oh right, I spent some time in Florida when I was younger and I remember it being so unpredictable. Just gotta keep an umbrella all the time lol.", "Cool. Was it interesting?", "Good for her! Moms get a lot done lol", "ARe you happy or sad?", "I bet. I she moving school or a job?", "Oh cool that's great! What were you doing that they recognised?", "Awesome. What is your job?", "Wow was it a scam or was it legit?", "That is so good congratulations you are lucky what are you going to use it for?", "Oh no, what happened?", "Oh no! But that happens (it has happened to me several times). At least you had the great workout!", "That's great. Are you excited?", "Is it your dream job? Then you should really be happy.", "Was it real?", "That's awesome. What are you going to buy?", "Australia. I hope to go there some day", "I bet, I will get there one day", "I've done the same thing before. I'm sure you weren't a bother", "Yeah and they really should be better about how they place their racks", "That has happend to me too.", "You can always sell them if you buy discs. Cant do anything with a download though", "We live and we learn lol", "I used to love that band", "I have not either", "Probably at 4 or 5! lol", "No idea! I haven't had cable in so long! I would HATE that and they always over charge! Don't they have a rule that theres no service fee if they are late?", "Was it real because I get those every day lol", "I could do so much with $120. Im jealous lol", "oh no! what happened?", "ah, crisis averted! that could have been a lot worse", "Was it good? I hate when your favorite place disappoints.", "That's great. Sundays are supposed to be breezy", "Hm, that sounds interesting. I'm not really familiar with this kind of situation, since I've never had to rent a car. What exactly happened, or what did that mean?", "Oh, so it was no big deal? At least you cared enough to stop someone and ask them about it. No harm, no foul.", "I bet that was a nice feeling", "That sounds perfect", "The dentist makes me a bit nervous", "Well at least think about the fact that it's a good thing to go to the dentist!", "That is awful, did the person who hit it leave a note or a call back number?", "You should ask the airport people if they have any security footage of the parking lot, maybe they can track down the car.", "What kind of food was there?", "It is nice that you enjoyed it.", "Oh man.  That would of startled me too.  What did you do after?", "Well I can understand your nervousness.  I probably would be on guard as well", "Oh that is tough.  It is hard when our pets pass away.", "It is like losing a family member isn't it.  Well, just think of all the good times and be thankful.", "That's great! I never really studied much so I could have done better on my tests", "Oh yes. But, I found that getting involved in clubs along with a major I liked actually allowed me to spend less time studying and more time learning for fun. It's a subtle, but important diffeence", "Judging by the :(, I'm assuming you didn't get to join them?", "I would be envious too.  Perhaps next time you can go somewhere and return the feeling :D", "I hope where ever you go, you visit someplace amazing!", "That is nice. Do you like a lot pizza?", "You are lucky.", "Were you worried about something? What was keeping you up?", "Hopefully you had a lock on them, you can never be too safe.", "Dang really! Sounds like you have a boyfriend that likes to shower you with presents.", "That means that he is always listening and paying attention to you!", "I have never tried a cold shower? What is it like?", "I bet it does wake you up right away. I guess I should try that sometime if I oversleep. lol !", "wow that is very rude of her", "No I have never dealt with a rude person like that that lives near me", "I totally agree. That actually sounds really good rihgt now.", "Sounds fun. Ill be ready. Hope were going to the beach thats closest to us!", "I will be expecting to see you there.", "Having positive attitude always succeed. Keep it up.", "Interesting.  What was the first thought that popped into your head when you witnessed this?", "Is that a reference to the color of the hair, the shape or something else?", "How did it go? That's an anxiety-inducing but hopeful situation!", "Congratulations! Enjoy the new gig! Good things happen to good people.", "Being defeatist is never a good move. Honestly, once you've got your foot in the door I think it's all about personality.", "I would argue most good employers can diagnose incompetence from the first or second conversation. If they can't, maybe they aren't good employers.", "Time does fly really fast. I just turned 30 and it feels like I was just a teenager yesterday!", "I'm sure it will. At least it gets us to enjoy life more and focus on the moment.", "Yeah, it's like a small world.", "I think it is merely a coincidence.", "Indeed they can. Is there any specific moment that you would like to talk about?", "Oh, I see. I thought that some other bad things happening in your personal life are making you cry", "I completely agree. We must have positive thoughts at all times.", "Our thoughts are were everything starts. Mindset is so important.", "That's awesome!  What do they do?", "That would be nice, but it's never good to dwell on things like that instead of looking toward the future.", "That sucks. How fast were you driving?", "I hate getting pulled over too. Especailly for something silly like being a couple of miles an hour over the speed limit", "Oh man, I'm so sorry to hear that. You're not a loser though! Just take one day at a time. If you relapsed yesterday just move on and do your best not to drink today and tomorrow", "Don't be so hard on yourself. We are all humans, we make mistakes.", "That is probably so annoying", "That really sucks. How long will it be going on?", "Wow.  That's either really lucky or unlucky, depending on what you want.  Are you wanting kids?", "Well, then congratulations!  I wish you the best of luck, and enjoy this time! :)", "Why not?", "Oh man! That is why I watch movies at home. It's just more comfortable.", "I have considered it myself but feel the same as you. Will you go back again?", "right, i feel you but maybe it will be good to get it all out!!", "Is she doing okay now?", "great, I am very glad to hear she is getting better!", "What is the job?", "Well congrats then, I am sure that is not easy", "What caused that to happen?", "Oh gosh, hopefully it doesnt happen next time", "What were the photos of?", "It is good to have those and look at once in awhile", "I am sorry to hear that, what happened?", "Did you try therapy at all or counseling?", "Why is that?", "I am sorry to hear that, I hope things improve for you a ton!", "Sometimes we believe is the things that happen to us ... they are many", "I interpret the difficulties", "the lack of humor", "Ok", "Oh goodness, I am so sorry to hear that. Was it sudden?", "That is awful and very sorry you had to go through that. I work at a cancer hospital so I can't imagine going through that with a loved one.", "What kind of stuff is in there?", "Oh okay, I love going through my old stuff too, it is really fun", "That sounds so fun!", "I hope you both have tons of fun!", "that's great! I'm glad to hear that. we often take our health for granted.", "i'm one of those people. Eat junk food even though i know it's not good for me", "Uh OH what happened", "Oh no, well mistakes do happen, it will be behind you in a few days", "Exactly good luck", "Oh yeah? What kind of old stuff?", "I always liked those old lunch boxes myself. Do you have a favorite?", "Nice! I loved that show when I was a kid. I never had the lunch box though.", "Oh, OK!  WHere are you moving to?", "That's good!  That will make your life much easier!  Congratulations!", "That's exciting. Do you have a plan for a date for when she says yes?", "What all is on the agenda for the date?", "Great. Are you going to get it published?", "What is the book about?", "Boo. What genre?", "OH NO that is the worst! Did you clean it up?", "You shoudl write the date on stuff to prevent that from happening again", "Oh no! What happened?", "Ouch. I hope she's okay.", "thats good, its always a good feeling after", "thats the way to do it", "Did his team win?", "That's great news! I bet you're so proud.", "Oh no!  Why are they driving you crazy?", "That is no good!  I guess it is time for you to go shopping!", "Storms are the worst and destroy so much.", "My family went through a big storm a few years ago.", "what happened on the phone call?", "I am so sorry about that.", "Has it made any scratch marks?", "Have you tried disciplining him in anyway", "Sounds like it's time for a crate.", "Yea, I hate calling ATT or Verizon they take forever to get on the phone.", "I think as we get smarter, it will get better.", "Wow!  Sounds like a keeper right there!  That must have been a nice surprise for you!", "It is always nice when someone gets their priorities right!", "Oh no!  That is horrible!  Is he OK?", "That is really sad!  I hope it was quick and painless.  I hate seeing anything suffer!", "Did you let him borrow it?", "That's good to hear. I assume everything went ok?", "Awesome. Alls well that ends well.", "Did you say yes?", "Where does she plan to go?", "Money problems are never fun. Trust me, I know.", "Yeah, definitely. Have you tried asking for a raise?", "Oh no, I'm so so sorry. I've always had at least one pet throughout my life, and they're truly part of the family.", "Yes, they're honestly more dear to me than my friends. I hope you're doing okay - I'm sure your dog was very loved and had a wonderful life, so try to take comfort in that.", "That is great! Doing what?", "I bet that is nice and probably has good benefits!", "I can never go on long trips.", "I can no longer afford them, long trips cost the most.", "Oh no!. Are you ok? Must not have been a bad one if you were laughing?", "How ironic. I kind of wish I were there to see it.", "I am bad at every game.", "I still could not do that, I am very weak human person.", "Do what i did, quit the job and live at home with mom.", "I still thing living with a relative is the cheapest way to go.", "That's awful! Luckily I paid all mine off, but I know many people still struggle with it", "Yea...the education costs are atrocious and, honestly, not even worth it on my opinion. It's just the piece of paper. The material you learn from them can be learned online for free or nearly so", "Typical of most companies.

Like I love that stuff.", "I am glad no one in your family is sick.", "Thank goodness my family is healthy too.", "But do they give raises more frequently and do they have better benefits. It may be worth it still,", "Benefits are worth a lot more than you think sometimes", "is there a special reason?", "going anywhere good?", "that sounds fun", "That is great. How have you done it?", "That is a lot of walking. I can hardly walk 1 mile.", "I have never been on a trip before.", "I have long weeks every single day.", "I would just quit and live off the government.", "Everyone can!

How long has she been gone?", "I know how you feel.", "I have that same problem!", "Holy goodness!!! I would be a bit jealous :(", "Is your friend ok? What kind of car was it?", "That is horrible news, I am so sorry for your loss.", "Is that good or bad?  Sometimes extra work can be a blessing, unless you are salaried, then it's just more work.", "I hope so too.  What kind of work is it?", "Oh, I am sorry for your loss", "Don't feel bad now. What's done is done", "I can understand. I am really sorry", "Oh no! Was anyone hurt?", "That is so sad. I hope they recover okay.

Are you home alone?", "I'm sure you are fine. I bet it is just a tree branch or something like that. Maybe a neighbor could go look for you.", "YAY, a promotion is always amazing.  when do you start?", "Thats amazing, financial stability can be a life changer.", "Maybe they're very eager to go a certain item.", "True, because regretfully I act that way sometimes too.", "Yeah I hear you! Do you like to read or watch TV?", "I like to do both as well. TV if I'm feeling lazy, reading if I feel more ambitious.", "Oh no!! How did you dry them?", "Oh that sounds awful! But at least no one stole anything from your car.", "Did you take it back that is so disgusting.", "I wouldn't want another either it takes one time for me to find hair, bug etc and I am done with the restaurant.", "Best way to ensure your food is clean and free of hair cook it yourself.", "That sounds great! I really pays off to be prepared.", "That sounds like some efficient planning! I hope you enjoy your trip!", "I can understand you. But this is the cycle of life, right? Kids grow and they have to find their own way of life in this world", "Good for you. You can also call your friends to hang out if you have close ones", "Oh no, I'm sorry. Did you stay long?", "Maybe she was around, but it wasn't time for the ball yet.", "That's wonderful. He'll be so excited when he finds out!", "I hope you guys have a great time.

I'm sure they will recognize the extra time you've been doing.", "Wow, I hope you're getting paid for all that extra time!", "Sorry to hear that my friend.. Was she facing an emergency?", "I know it sucks, but i think you should have an open conversation to your girl about this", "That is a tragedy! Where do you think you left it? Did you check your pockets?", "Interesting. I hope you do find it. I don't know how you brush your hair.", "How does that make you feel?", "I am so sorry to hear you're going through this. Hopefully, it's nothing.", "Oh, so you always prepare well huh?", "I always wanted that level of discipline. good for you :)", "Congratulations! boy or girl", "well, as long as its a happy healthy baby you guys will be fine", "Yep.

Just visualize yourself already having the job.", "Congrats", "Was it fun?", "That is no good dude", "You should. and get new friend", "You did! That's so cool!", "Any free money is great.", "Oh that sounds exciting! when do you go?", "A new start and a new life, that is exciting! I hope you love it.", "mine too.. the nature is so peaceful and beautiful during the fall", "i have been there, it is so lovely. you are going to love it", "Ewww. I would have been too", "Did anyone video it?", "Aw that's awful, how old was it?", "I hope you're holding up then, I would be devastated if my pet died.", "yea thank god he didnt go to the GSW", "yea i bet they are", "you have eyes too", "Have eyes for someone else", "oh yea i know how that feels", "it really does suck", "that movie scared me to death, and i usually dont scare very easy.", "oh my lord!!! how did you sleep that night?", "Oh no!

Im late I just saw wonderwomAN", "OH my word. I feel like I should watch them all over", "is he sick?", "Does he has any record with heart problems?", "oh wow that really sucks", "dang that is rough", "That's so sad! Did he at least die of old age?", "I'm so sorry to hear that, may he rest in peace.", "Is that because you just like being organized?", "That is really a good way to be. I need to practice this more, myself!", "Bed is always a source of comfort for me. Especially, after work when I feel so drained and stressed out", "Indeed. Particularly, when i grab my phone and watch short clips from my favorite TV shows on Youtube", "aw I'm sorry to hear.  Did you conquer your loneliness?", "I'm glad you were able to adjust.  It can be lonely without family around.", "oh no.. why are you feeling that way?", "That sucks.. Are you having trouble falling asleep?", "How did that go exactly?", "She is the most beautiful girl I have ever seen.", "i dont blame you! i would have also!", "nasty! did you tell him anything?", "Oh wow!

You seem very happy.", "Sorry to hear that! Why do you think that might happen?", "Hopefully that doesn't happen, and you have job security.", "That's pretty embarrassing haha. Ever find out what it was?", "That would make sense, though you could probably have smelt it if it was coffee.", "Oh damn that's so sad. Was it salvageable?", "It definitely sounds that way, gonna upgrade it?", "oh yea i had those out 2 years ago it sucks", "yea it can be sore and you cant eat anything", "im glad i still have mine around.", "exactly what i do. we were never close growig up. we are now.", "Wow, what is chiller theatre? I'm intrigued.", "Must be fun but unnerving as well. Whats your favourite horror movie?", "What happened to you?", "Your best friends?", "really what kind of sweets did you eat?", "I love cookies especially oreo's they are my favorite", "That is nice to have good memories.", "Did you go with your cousins?", "Why is that", "I was too", "No, I don't get any golden opportunity. did you  ?", "Don't worry. Earn for it and go!!", "Oh no. Floodwaters can be devastating. Was there a lot of damage?", "Good thing you were prepared.", "Did yall make up", "That is not good", "Will you get to make it up?", "I am sure you will find time", "Oh wow, how did he do", "That is so cool", "That sounds like something that could really show off your talents.", "That's great! Hope your hard work pays off.", "How expensive is that to go to?", "That is not too bad if you had a good time though", "The loss of a pet is heartbreaking. I know how you feel. How old was Trevor.", "Life is hard. But remember he didn't die he went to his forever home.", "Sorry to hear that.  Have you since been able to overcome your loneliness?", "I understand feeling like a duck out of the pond.  Glad to hear you've made progress.", "Don't feel nervous, you need to be confident!", "It's hard to push that feeling away sometimes, I know.", "That's exciting! I'm guessing you're a Lakers fan?", "What team was he on before?", "I understand that, I will pray for you", "That makes sense, I wish you both the best of luck and health!", "How old is he?", "Wow, great job so far, kep up the great parenting!", "Wasn't that out a long time ago? It must've been super scary if you still remember it.", "Wow, I wouldn't have been brave enough to do that!", "Yes, it is hard to see people with things you can't afford to buy for yourself.", "Yes, I like the color red as well. I have actually own a couple red sports cars.", "It is great to be thorough and prepared. Are you expecting to perform well?", "Thats nice, i wish you the very best for your results!", "I can see why! That's highly inappropriate.", "You should. He is obviously at the very least flirting with you and at worst harassing you", "Oh wow, that is going to be such a sweet experience!", "That is very true. I sincerely wish you both to have a wonderful time!", "I'm so sorry to hear that. Do you have things of hers that remind you of her often?", "That is beautiful that you have those things of hers. Mothers are very special people.", "I have been to that, it is such a wonderful experience. You are going to love it!", "You seem to have a great taste in spending your free time. I wish you get to have a splendid time in there!", "I'm sorry to hear about that. How did he die?", "yeah I bet. Im sorry for your loss", "How did you hurt your back?", "Ohh wow! I hope it gets better for you", "Did you ask him to replace it?", "I agree with you there, I would ask him to pay honestly", "That's nice. How  do you like the dog?", "That is so sweet. My apartments don't allow pets", "That is for sure, especially a smell that just throws you back", "Exactly, sometimes I just smell a good barbeque and that brings me back to those summer days as a kid, life is great sometimes", "That stinks. Im sorry to hear that", "I bet! It seems like fun", "Congratulations. Fun plans?", "Awww. I'm jealous lol", "Awww. Did you keep it?", "Thats great. I know he appreciates it", "That's great. I hope you do well!", "Good luck!", "how old was it", "they live that long ? interesting", "How'd that go?", "Well congratulations! That must have been nerve-wracking.", "That stinks. Maybe he is going through something that only new stuff can solve", "Do it! I bet you deserve it", "Did you make special arrangements so things went smoothly with one car?", "Well I am glad it worked out", "What did you find?!", "Oh no, are you going to talk to him about the dangers of drugs?", "Remind me, which show was that?", "That's so cool!  I'm gonna have to check it out", "That's nice. Are you going to hang it up?", "Great, you've found an old treasure.", "I'm sorry. How long had you been together?", "Just try and get through each day, one at a time. Don't think too far ahead.", "That sounds scary.  Are you going to investigate?", "If this were a movie, I'd be yelling at the screen for you to leave the house and not go down there.", "I am so sorry to hear that.  Is he planning to retake the test?", "What test?", "That's great. Is that your only son?", "I'm sure the memories will be great", "Oh wow! Hopefully no one saw it", "Im sorry about that. Ive gone through that before. Laughter can be good medicine sometimes", "What is it called ?", "Okay, well I guess I'm happy for you then.", "That's understandable.  How receptive was he to your complaint?", "Oh, so it got pretty serious.  I guess he needs to learn to respect boundaries.", "Did you find anything?", "I bet that was very nostalgic for you.", "That's a hard hit to take.  Why do you suspect they got it?", "So what are you going to do about?  Are you going to start looking for another place to work?", "What did you mess up?", "I'm sure you'll be fine.  Have you made many similar mistakes in the past?", "I wouldn't worry too much about it then.  Don't let it get you down.", "Wow, that's nice. I hope you treated yourself to something extravagant!", "I guess they didn't do as good a job as they should have, lol. Wish my car dealership had missed a few hundred bucks!", "Well, it was worth $500! That's about what my car's worth these days - had it for years. Still runs great tho'.", "How fun! In a tent or an RV?", "Don't forget a first aid kit! We always need those on camping trips!", "Ugh, that's so annoying.  How long did you have to follow behind them?", "I hope you weren't late for anything important!", "memory lane right there! which cartoons?", "Very cool I havent seen the older style cartoons myself in years.", "That would creep me out too what kind of calls??", "Alright that would creep me out too. Block the number or change yours!! weird.", "Uh oh. Are you going to confront him about it?", "Well I hope that he actually listens to you this time and gets help.", "Congratulations, that's awesome! I hope you're getting a raise too!", "Hope you treat yourself to celebrate, you deserve it!", "That sounds amazing! When will you find out?", "You sound positive so I am sure you will get it!!!", "omg, that's so scary! are you okay? did you call the police?", "that's good to hear! people are crazy", "I bet.  It is nice to have a day off every now and then", "I like having days off to do absolutly nothing.  It helps with stress.", "That's the worst.  Is it damaging the curtains too much?", "Is there anything you can put on them or near them to stop him?", "That is great! Adopt, don't shop! Always a great motto!", "That is great, I commend you!", "Have you prepared enough for it?", "Well Im sure you be fine. Just relax.", "That's good to hear! Have you been eating healthy?", "That's great! Keep up the good work!", "thats strange, my dog will eat anything lol", "maybe he will start warming up to it soon", "About what?!", "That's awesome. I'm glad she did well.", "thats always a bummer when you put in such work and get nothing in return", "Oh I just quit a few weeks ago due to a similar situation actually! Never been happier!", "Did you study for it or are you winging it?", "Don't worry then.  You did you part!! I'm sure you will do fine!", "Maybe you should try and have a party?", "Yes being alone is not very fun.", "What will your new age be?", "You should have a great time, congrats on the new age!", "I went through a similar thing a few years back.  Everything seemed hollow to me.  How long has it been?", "If your depressed, speak to someone.  If it's just adjusting to the change, that comes in time.", "Why is it that you are in trouble?", "Can you just replace the document?", "I would be reporting that to the police for sure.", "Thats true right.. i forgot how stupid the law can be sometimes. Thats insane.", "Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that. That must be very difficult for you and your family.", "I am so sorry for your loss. I hope that you find peace in this difficult time.", "That's great. What will you be doing at your new job?", "Sometimes being a manager is the worst job you can have at a place, you seem to be the one who gets blamed for everything.", "Aw man, that sucks. Promotions usually aren't given fairly in my experience. Was that the case for you too?", "I'll keep my fingers crossed for you that you get that promotion next time!", "That is amazingly lucky! good for you!", "That is great! I wish I was lucky like that!", "Awh poor baby.. I am sure itll get better now tho! How old is he?", "Ugh noooo! Thats terrible i am so sorry. :(", "I would be so excited! Did they pay you for it?", "Hopefully! that would be so amazing!", "That sounds like such a fun, peaceful morning. So jealous you have a pool, it's been scorching outside!", "Ah okay, nice for the kiddos then. They grow up fast, so hold onto these moments while you can:)", "Aw, well when your younger you don't do those things on purpose. I think everyone is mean to their siblings every now and then.", "Have you talked to her about it? Maybe she doesn't really think about it anymore.", "I am so sorry to hear about your loss. What did he get you?", "That was very nice of him. I'm glad you have a nice husband.", "Well better to be sooner than later on something like that. Dont be hard on yourself.", "Thats so silly its none of his worry. He needs to hush up. lol", "Wow! He sounds like a super smart cat! How did you get him out of there?", "Well at least you managed to save him!", "Oh man, I've definitely had a few coworkers like that myself before. What does she even talk about?", "That's the worst! Some people, once they get started, they just can't stop themselves. It's like opening a can of Pringles.", "Did it feel good to get it out?", "Oh no, that's awkward! Did you get in trouble for it?", "That's heartbreaking, but you're amazing for doing that. Cats are my favorite and I've rescued many animals. It's a lot of work.", "Yes, and when they love you it feels special, because they don't love everyone like dogs do. You've racked up a lot of good karma for saving them!", "I'm there too. Struggling each day. It really gets old.", "Yeah, that's right. I've been pushing 70 hours working a week for as long as I can remember. Hold out, maybe it'll change.", "You would be so suprised at how much stays all the way in the nooks and crannies of your brain when you take a break!", "Im glad it paid off for you, you must be super proud!", "Oh no, I am so sorry. What did you do?", "That is tough. That must have been quite the trying time. Did you eventually find work?", "Good, how long has it been since you saw them last?", "I hope you all have some fun.", "Oh yes, fall is definitely my favorite season as well! I love fall scents!", "It is the best season, by far! Plus, Halloween!", "Oh man, those things are awful and reproduce like crazy.  We left our house for a week and came back to tons of them everywhere! The best trick is putting a little apple cider vinegar in a jar, a drop of dish soap on top of that and cover it with cling wrap and put holes in it.  They will gravitate toward it and you'll catch a bunch! Just keep changing it every few days.", "Seriously, gone is good.  They do have bacteria on them and lay their eggs on fruit and veggies and the larva burrow into the fruit or veggie so its good you trashed it all. Glad you're free of them!", "That is so exciting! It can be stressful and expensive planning a wedding.", "It really gets stressful when you get down to the last minute. You are always so worried you are going to forget something.", "oh that was nice of them", "haha thats pretty fun", "Oh no, I am sorry to hear that. I hope that he gets to feeling better. How old is he?", "Oh I see, I can understand your concern. Perhaps he will live longer than most hamsters!", "That is awesome!  I would be really excited if I were in yyour shoes!", "I hope you go far in your job!  Good luck!", "That is quite upsetting. Do you know what ails it?", "Well I certainly hope that the dog gets to feeling better. Are you close friends with this canine companion?", "Oh no, what happened? Hopefully the whole weekend didn't get ruined!", "Poor little thing, chicken pox are the worst. On the bright side, you still got to spend your anniversary with your husband, just not, you know, in the way you hoped. Hope you guys get to have a make-up weekend soon!", "Wow thats nice.  What do you drive?", "You have to think of the positives.  Just because they have a new car doesnt mean their life is great.  They could be watching you wishing they were fit and healthy like you are.", "lol and some day you might you buy your own new Tesla, if you feel like it!", "Exactly!", "oh thats nice", "yea i would be to", "Why's that?", "Nostalgia is a weird feeling.", "Nice, what do you have planned?", "Sound great, I'm happy for you!", "Wow!  That must feel great!  You should be proud of this accomplishment.  People can go their whole lives without ever being published!", "Congratulations!  I wish I could be published.", "What are some things you will bring?", "It's a good idea to write thing down that you might forget.", "What is wrong? Are you okay?", "I am so sorry. I hope you get all the help you need.", "We have been getting a lot of rain as well. I have to mow my lawn so much.", "Yeah I know what you mean. I can't wait for the rainy season to end.", "Oh my goodness, I've almost gotten hit while on a bike before and it's terrifying. I'm so glad you're alright!", "Ditto. It's not hard to do, and so many lives would be saved if people would just follow the rules. I'll send good vibes out so nothing bad happens to you in the future!", "Wow, congratulations! Have you guys set a date yet?", "Oh I feel you, I used to work in the wedding industry. It's crazy how much it costs even for the most basic wedding.", "I know exactly how that happens. Sometimes the food is just too good to pass up.", "Well I say go for it. It is only your birthday once a year. The other 364 days can make up for it.", "Glad to hear you are having a good day. Wish every day was like that.", "That is true. It puts things in context.", "That is really awesome! That is so important to be involved in his life like that.", "It does! Kids can understand things about the bible that most adults overlook.", "that is frustrating, especially if the weather isnt ideal", "that is unfortunate, im sorry that happened!", "That isn't good. Are you mad at your friend?", "Are you going to get another cat?", "I feel the same way as well!  I get really excited thinking about decorating and giving gifts!", "I agree!  Everything that surrounds Christmas makes me smile and feel content.  It makes me thankful for everything good in life!", "That's a great outlook I think. We often lose focus of that very important fact.", "That's inspiring to me. I will try to think more like that as well whenever I get stressed in life.", "8 Miles!? That's very impressive.  I bet I could barely make it a mile!", "Have you been a long time runner before that?", "I can relate to that!  Yeah, my wife with my credit card, lol!", "Haha, I can understand the hesitation then.  But was the vacation at least worth the money?", "That's something that takes a lot of contemplation, because it's such a big decision to make. Will the extra money be worth the extra work?", "Oh wow, an additional 40K is a lot! I'd be willing to put up with quite a bit for a pay increase that large.", "Oh wow. I'll be honest and say it wouldn't be worth it for me! What's an extra 40K if you're never not at work to enjoy it?", "Oh wow, I think it'd take me much longer to not bust my butt! That is impressive!", "Maybe she's more athletic than you think! She might be better than you soon. Better watch out!", "awesome! what kind?", "oh man those are super nice! all electric is pretty neat", "That's good on his part, how do you feel about it?", "That's awesome, and I agree, the job market is tough now a days.  High paying or not.", "Oh that's no good. Any special reason why they were late?", "That's a bad attitude to have. I hope he can straighten up a bit if we wants to keep working there.", "It will be okay. It's always hard making that step, but it's good for your health to do it.", "I wish my insurance would give me something like that! It's good to go anyways.", "Have you studied for it?  Always helps to prepare!", "Good luck, I'm sure you will do fine!", "Hey everyone trips up a little. What you need to remember is that you and your wife made a commitment and you should follow through on that.", "It's ok to have a cheat day everyone once in a while, but you can't give in. Be strong!", "You only get to do it once?", "Oh no. I hope it goes well for you. That's a lot of hard work.", "Congrats!", "Was it more than expected?", "That has happened to me, but with texts though lol", "Did you apologize?", "LOL", "what's wrong with it?", "can you fix it?", "That is great news. Have you also been working out?", "Has it been easy or hard to do that?", "did they notice it was missing?", "well at least you are attempting to be honest about it.", "Ohh wow! Are you excited?", "Ohh that stinks. I dont blame you though", "That's very creepy, did he say anything to you?", "Those are definitely the scary types, they don't recognize social cues at all.", "Ouch!  Did she hurt it or is it a degenerative thing? I hope she can find help with physical therapy.", "Oh good.  Hopefully she'll try to fix it with physical therapy first.  Some doctors love to do surgery right away when its not necessary.  Recommend that she get a second opinion.  Hope she resolves it!", "I've never understood that, it's not like they can't afford to eat since they have a job! Do you know which coworker it was?", "Next time bring your lunch in a biohazard bag, maybe they will leave it alone.", "What did you do?", "You definitely can't be too careful these days", "how do you know no one goes in if you arent in there?", "ok", "Oh no! That stinks. I've never had a cat specifically because I've never been good with the idea of being able to train them. Plus it seems like you just get the one personality, and they never grow to like you. But I'm biased.", "Yeah, I know they definitely suit some people. I actually now technically have one... my roommate wanted to get one, and I felt too bad to say no. And he actually is a pretty nice guy, mostly because he's been affectionate from the start. So, we'll see how it goes! Sorry again about your mat.", "Wow good for you! I hope that it works out for you!", "Yeah and I bet the higher paycheck will make the work worth it.", "What! First of all, are you alright?", "Oh, well that's something, at least. I can't believe people are such cowards, though.", "That's great. Do they know?", "Well that is awesome. I bet they won't let you down in the new positions either", "I have never run a marathon", "You can try your best and if you don't finish there is always the next one", "Well that's some sort of motivation lol", "Congratulations!  What are you getting your PhD in?", "Oh geeze, I didn't know I was talking to a genius.  How long is the program?", "Have you tried to talk to your teacher?", "What school is this you are talking about?", "That's pretty cool that you're motivated and excited to start it. Most people would be scared and procrastinating. You'll do great.", "Sounds like you have a plan laid out. It also sounds like you've already accomplished so much.. You should be very proud. I'm with you, I have over $40,000 in student loans. Such a crazy pressure on someone right when they graduate. Good luck!", "I can understand that.", "You must love him very much, that's good.", "Aw, it takes time! Making friends isn't always so easy so give it a little bit of time", "The best thing to do is join clubs and get involved. You generally make friends by association!", "that is really nice of you to do, not a lot of people help others like that anymore", "same with me if i ever see someone that could use my help, i will most likely bring it to you", "Ah dang... Sorry that happened to you. It stinks too because a lot of the time that stuff is just decided by who is liked more, or who has better connections, and not actual merit. If you're good, I'm sure you will get recognized at some point.", "Well, keep a good attitude. If you like the work and the job, hopefully that will be enough.", "Thats very sad to hear im sorry that happened to you", "I would suggest moving on time heals all wounds", "Did she say thank you?", "What a lovely woman, and you're lovely, too!", "That's the worst! What did you do?", "That sounds like a good idea. I hope you solve the problem quickly!", "Yeah, those were better times. Brings back good memories.", "Well, maybe yours. Mine just want to sit inside and play on their phones all day.", "Oh man..I have had those too..and where I am the one getting crap even though I do my job and everyone elses..I HATE sitting around at work...I either want to work or go home. I hope your boss knows your co-worker is lazy?", "I AGREE and frankly if your boss does not see this and doesn't give you praise then I would quit as well or contact human resources! This kind of stuff is not acceptable.", "sounds like you ate a delicious dessert, what did you eat?", "that sounds delicious i love chocolate cake i think that would be my favorite dessert", "O? That's a brave and noble decision.", "That's hard but great of you to do, good luck.", "Where will you be shopping?", "Nice! Do you have anything in specific you want to buy?", "hahah it whas happened to me it the worst thing", "did you still eat it? or did you throw it away", "That's nice of them! People stopped doing that for me once I got older. I miss them", "Well, I'm happy for you :) It shows that they care", "Thats horrible! Im so sorry to hear that.  Why would she do that?", "It depends, if you love her, you could try to work it out.  Or you could cheat on her too", "O yea? I", "I'm trying to teach mine tricks myself* I think that's fun to watch!", "I've cheated on occasion. It's never right but it's easy. At least you're ashamed of it.", "That's your decision to make, but I think it would at least put you in control of the situation.", "That sounds fun. Is it a special occasion?", "I understand. Sticking with what you know seems safer.", "you must be loving it", "true that, you cant be too sure until you use it", "Tough week ahead. Do you think you have met your expectations thus far?", "Sounds good. Your supervisor must proud of your work and your displayed high self-esteem", "Oh no! That has so happened to me before! It was only by a couple dollars a month but I SO needed those couple of dollars at the time. I would be MAAADDD", "Call the bank and get it fixed ASAP! That's got to be so annoying for you!", "I buy those like twice a year and never win.", "Wow! That's awesome! What did you do with it?", "Hey, why not? It's unexpected money!", "Yeah I feel like you get lucky once then it's all downhill from there.", "Where was she?", "Does she have a new ex now?", "I would not put up with it either", "i love when the rain his the soil in the open field , the smell of wet dirt is just refreshing", "I bet you are. What are you going to do?", "sounds like a real good time i hope you enjoy it", "Why is that", "You will be alright buddy", "What have you done this year if you dont mind me asking?", "That is great, well there is still time to go this year!", "I love it when it's nice out. Are you going to do something outside?", "That sounds great. A nice long walk in perfect weather. There's hardly anything better.", "Are you excited for him or jealous? lol", "I feel you! I know its hard having siblings sometimes! Go buy a toy car and park it on top of his.", "Can you report the caller?", "Be sure to do it, otherwise they could keep harassing you", "What class is it for?", "I never took chemistry. Do you feel prepared for the test?", "That's great.  Have they always been as supportive as they are now", "nice.  what do you do for a living", "Have you thought about spraying your garden?", "Perhaps there is an all natural remedy you could try", "Same here, I'm in Texas.  Where are you located", "Nice! I used to live in St. Paul, MN.  Weather's like a tundra which is why I'm down here", "Were you able to get inside fast?", "Oh wow! That would be annoying!", "How did they get off work midweek?", "That would be nice but not fun that you don't have the same days off.", "where is your favorite place to go?", "i can imagine, i hope you have a great time this year", "I remember when my first child started, I was a nervous wreck.", "So they don't even have teachers yet? Wow, that's crazy.", "Have you tried getting out and meeting new people?", "What about online friends?", "that would hurt my feelings. are you alright?", "i totally understand that. i'm sorry.", "That sucks! Did you have a spare on you?", "That is good to hear.", "That's understandable. What kind of project was it? Were you involved?", "That's so generous of you. It's people like you that make the work week bearable!", "That's okay, I'm 25 and still in college. How did it go for you?", "That's awesome. I'm glad it worked out well for you. :)", "Oh wow. I would have been so scared. more of a stranger than the storm", "Well that was nice. How long were you stuck there", "Did the ads bring up good memories I hope?", "I have absolutely no idea what Boglins are, but I'm sure they were awesome!", "Sounds frightening! Was this off the coast of a beach or something?", "That is one of my greatest fears. Did you have to swim sideways from the current to escape?", "Great to hear that you made it out ok!", "Well, I can understand that. It's very hard to be on a very strict diet, without a break here and now!", "Well, i am sure you are disappointed, but all you can do now is just get back on the diet again and try to be more dedicated. It's hard, I know!", "Is this a career change?", "Oh hey, I'm a nursing graduate! It'll be difficult at first, but you'll get the hang of it.", "Aw, that sucks. Did you give her a proper burial?", "Awwww, I am so sorry. Have you thought about getting a new pup?", "Yea, a new job is useless pretty stressful.", "It will be ok in the end.", "Oh that is a real bummer. Were you hurt?", "Ok glad you did not get injured. I hope your car gets fixed.", "Sorry to hear that", "Well that's good. You never know what to say in that situation", "I wish yo the best", "That must of been fun to go through.", "That is cool. Is your mother still alive?", "What was?", "Really? Did you manage to cope?", "And was there?", "Good", "im sorry to hear that", "you ever ever plan to get another ?", "Really, how did they do it?", "Amazing! Well done to him.", "Well done, at least you will sit in your room excited and relaxed now", "Heat wave is getting so terrible theses days. I even watched on CNN that the whole of New South Wales is experiencing a drought, so sad", "That sounds unfortunate. You must have been so annoyed with him!", "People like that should just do shopping online instead of ruining the experience for everyone else!", "Do you have daughters of your own?", "Why is that?", "yea traffic sucks", "well yea thats true", "Same here. It reminds me of my childhood for some reason.", "Exactly, i am overcome with nostalgia and get tears of joy sometimes.", "I bet! Did it turn out nice?", "That's good... I can't wait for my vacation!", "That's terrible! Did the dog survive?", "Maybe someone should train the kid to be stronger... by beating him up!", "What I do is to write all the good things I did within the week, I think you should do the same", "i agree with you buddy", "You must have prepared really well. Did the trip go well?", "Sounds like the trip went well. I am glad you enjoyed it!", "all the time", "its just life", "Nice, what breed is the puppy?", "I have never heard of such a breed. Must be so cute!", "i do that all the time. i live on the mexican border. what border did you cross?", "glade all was well", "Cool! How did it go?", "Great! I hope you get the job. I'll be rooting for you!", "He sounds pretty strong. Any reason in particular that he did that?", "No kidding. Definitely some quality entertainment for dinner time!", "That must be so exciting!", "I hope you both have a great time!", "oh how does it go", "its ok you tried your best", "Well that is great and sad all at the same time. How far away did she move?", "Aw well that is normal. I'm sure she didn't want to leave. Every day will get a little easier.", "Oh my goodness, that sounds terrifying.", "I'm glad that you are okay.", "i bet that was quite the blast from the past", "yes they do. mine are already out of college", "Oh, are you going on a trip?", "That sounds like a fun time.", "That is so nice of them!", "I am so happy for you! Congrats!", "Really?", "That's fun", "Oh no! I'm so sorry! It's so difficult to lose a pet.", "I hope in time you are able to feel better.... and that your heart will be filled with happy memories.", "That's awesome! Happy belated birthday! What did she get you?", "Sweet! I really like Ducati's they are beautiful bikes.", "Did it rain a lot?", "That must be really scary to go through.", "That sounds like fun! What happened?", "Yeah- I understand that. I don't let anyone drive my car, either. I hope everything worked out okay!", "That seems like it would be a little awkward to me..", "Well, they sound like they are actually just a nice person trying to help you out, that is really nice.", "That's always a nice find.", "I bet it was! I love looking at photo albums", "That is nice. Did you start playing guitar with him?", "That is good.", "I am also working from home from time to time. I could feel some time lonely.", "I usually get out after finishing work to feel less lonely.", "Oh, that must have been so embarrassing.", "I'm sorry it happens to us at times.", "Congratulations! That is so cool!", "I hope you have fun with that money.", "I can't believe your coworker would do that to you! Did your manager listen?", "I wouldn't be either. Are you going to try to talk to your coworker about it?", "OH wow! I bet you all had a blast!!", "They will really appreciate that when they are older and look back on it.", "oh god, what do you do at that time", "how did you feel at that time", "Oh wow! Are the babies ok?", "Good thinking. I'm sure the parent bunnies appreciated that.", "Oh man. What a bummer!  I love cucumbers and hummus!  Do you have anything else you're growing that survived?", "Oh good, I'm glad the entire garden didn't get ruined.  I would love to plant a garden one day soon since I went vegan plant based about 3 months ago.  Happy tomato eating to you!", "Oh what a mess. I would hope that they picked it up.", "Well at least they cleaned up after. I would have been more annoyed if they didnt.", "Could you tell me what you have done?", "That sounds great, I hope you succeed.", "That's great news! Congrats! My garden is not doing great this year. Do you grow anything else?", "Yum. I wish I had a green thumb.", "That's awesome, It is very hot where I live, so I am jealous!", "Well I'm glad you get to enjoy some nice weather for a change!", "where exactly are you cos it rained all through in my area?", "ok im at the south east", "ohh wow! That's not cool", "I wish people would take responsibilities for their own actions", "Oh man! Hopefully nothing broke!", "At least it sounds like you recovered everything!", "He accused me of stealing from him", "Sorry, that was an error! Any way over to your conversation.Who did you cut off that made you feel bad?", "Yea I hear ya. Im stuck here at work for another day too.", "I just hope it doesnt rain this weekend.", "What is the test on? Have you prepared for it? I bet you will do better than you think!", "Good for you! I bet you will do amazing. Best of luck!", "i feel the same one and lately it seems to be getting worse. i've never been brave enough to go eat alone.", "i get that. i work all day then come home to the same routine everyday.", "Me too! I'm stuck inside at work and hearing about how great it is out there.", "Haha, same! Just one more hour for me. Hope you can enjoy it soon!", "That is not good, what happened", "That is never a good thing, I hope they land on their feet", "How did they do that?", "Oh, well that is a nice surprise though!", "That is nasty, how do they get away with that?", "Exactly, I would report them, so nasty", "How so?", "I hope so too, get it checked out!", "Sorry to hear that. It would really upset me to be in that situation!", "I hope you win that one! Good luck!", "I am sorry for your loss, at least you got some time together", "I feel that way about my grandma, it is sad that by the time we are born they are so old", "I think lyft is better", "I would hate that", "Where to?", "oh, I am sorry to hear that, why did they move away?", "They sounds very complicated", "That is nice to have", "having friends over is always nice!", "i bet. hope you all have a fantastic time!", "How do you feel about that?", "Are you guys in good relations?", "did it bring back a lot of old mermories?", "thats good that you have progressed", "She is a crappy person, flirting with someone who is in a relationship. Good on you- stand up guy", "Lol- Well poor you. I have always had guys doing the same and it means nothing to me. If I am in a relationship..or heck even when I am not..I don't get interested in random people generally. I have to know who someone is..Remember that- what lasts is WHO someone is...Someone you want to grow old with..Bodies won't last.", "That must of been weird. Who was it?", "Was it suppose to scare you?", "thats awesome", "Well I hope it lasts forever", "That's good! I guess you studied a lot?", "That's good. I am sure you will do great on it.", "Ouch, that sounds pretty gross!", "I'd avoid that taxi driver again if you have the chance.", "I hope it was maybe the weight of the muscle that the scale was picking up.", "Yes, don't let that stop you. Also pay attention to what you eat as well. It's even more important than the exercise portion.", "I don't know whether that's a good or bad thing. Which is it?", "That's great! It's definitely a good thing when you can be yourself.", "What was it I wonder?", "It must've been nasty like puke", "I like that philosophy. Here lately, has it been easier or harder to stay positive?", "I like that, how long have you felt this way about life?", "wow, its good to warm", "it is easier to walk around when its sunny also", "What exactly did he do>", "Yes, some people have to stay away form law enforcement jobs.", "Wow! I bet you two are very excited!", "That is wonderful. Our first vacation after getting married was full of fun, sun and adventure. Those are the best!", "You sound very confident. That's good", "I know what you mean. Just believe in yourself", "Is he being too noisy?", "I see how that can be annoying, have you asked him to stop doing that?", "You weren't excited about it?", "I understand. Stress is a definite mood killer", "ive always wanted to have the eye surgery. im ready to get rid of my glasses and contacts", "im glad you feel happy about it", "It's good to believe in good things.", "Yes, I like your attitude.", "it's true there's nothing like the good old days", "i'm glad you were one of them!", "I know how you feel. Do you have a big trip planned once you receive your passport?", "I hope you enjoy your adventures!", "I hear you. I had the same experience after just 5 years", "I understand. She took my daughter with her", "What subject are you trying to pass?", "I love math, good luck with your exams than.", "why were you acting like that?", "i'm glad you were in a good mood.", "Did they say or do anything specifically to you that made you feel that way?", "I understand how that can make you feel a certain way. Unfortunately, there are those types of people around every corner.", "Oh Wow! 20 years at your job! You must be well liked there.", "It must have been a wonderful surprise for you.", "Oh my goodness, what was the terrible news?", "I am so sorry, I hope your brother ended up being okay.", "Dang, that's not good. What did you end up doing??", "Oh wow. Did the police get called? I hope you didn't get in trouble.", "Yeah? What is changing?", "Brilliant. here are you going?", "Amazing! and Exotic", "That's so generous of you. The world could use more people like you.", "Caring for both the young and the old. Any hospital would be lucky to have you on staff!", "Oh my, how did she react?", "Ha! Do you feel bad about it?", "It certainly can. What type of job are you looking for?", "Maybe they had lots of other candidates to see", "I know that feeling. Something will come through though", "Yes! I feel like the day escaped me. Have you done that recently?", "It is Friday, that would be a nice way to start the weekend!", "Ugh I can imagine. But your time will come, be patient!", "Have you tried yoga? It can help in the meanwhile till you get a proper vacation.", "Oh no! Did you get the surgery?", "But you have recovered now. Right?", "Are you pregnant?", "Congratulations! That's brilliant news", "Good job! Do you feel proud of yourself?", "Hard work always pays off! Keep it up.", "What did you do?", "Man! That's pretty bad.", "i hope it goes well for her", "good luck!", "Awesome! Glad that you did well on the exam!", "Now you can celebrate this exam result! Always feels good to accomplish something like this.", "oh wow. that is some scary stuff!! what happend?", "did they catch the person?", "You shouldn't like to your mom. I think you should tell her the truth about what really happened.", "That sounds like a great idea!", "Oh no! You have to have a tough mentality when you do that as it can be rough to have people see you fail", "That's good! Practice makes perfect and if everyone stopped when they failed, we would not have as much as we do today", "That's terrible. Did you let others know that you had completed the job?", "I could imagine. Some people stoop low to take credit for what others do.", "what kind of surgery was it?", "Thats awesome! Its great to have friends their for someone.", "Oh no! Did you scold him?", "I'd be angry too, but it's hard to get mad at doggos.", "Congrats to you!

Does she appreciate all the help you give?", "She will definitely appreciate it when she gets older too.  I still remember my dad helping me with math homework and cant thank him enough for the help he gave me throughout the years.", "Im sorry about that. How did you find out?", "That stinks. Are you still with her or did you leave her?", "Whoa that is really cool. Did you train him to do that?", "That is amazing. Must be a very smart dog.", "I understand! As we get older, it's hard to do it all everyday!", "It happens, but definitely be honest as you would want someone to be honest with you", "Oh no, are you able to afford the repair for it?", "What a great friend you have. Definitly get him a gift when you are done.", "I hope you can too. How is it going?", "That's great! I have faith that you can do it.", "That's really good! Do you think you're ever going to use the card again?", "That is wise. I too am trying to pay off my credit card debts. After that, I'm cutting them up.", "That would have really scared me.", "I bet you are thankful that your friend was there.", "All of it??? Oh no. How bad do you feel right now?", "Haha I bet. Im sure they were looking forward to it.", "ewww.", "Why would it be in the house to begin with? does the dog poop in the house?", "You are having trouble with family ?", "Mine isn't either.

How'd you do that?", "What were you doing on the roof?", "Did you catch anything?", "Did you at least have fun?", "congrats! you must be proud!", "My daughter is only in eigth grade we have a while to go", "That is good to feel that way. You don't want to feel like someone close to you would let you down. Did it work out for you?", "Oh I am sorry. That is sad. Remember that it is not your fault. I would think of the people who have been there for you.", "Oh gosh, you also scared of bugs?? That's my worst fear", "I would have a heart attack!", "I have no idea what those are!", "oh ok. I like ravioli is it like that?", "What are pierogies? a type of food?", "Ah nice, I love dumplings, what are in them?", "That's no good, did you throw it out?", "Hope you don't get sick!  That would be a bad start to the weekend.", "Oh, I am so sorry. It has to be the most difficult thing to have to do. I had to do that with my gorgeous lab - I still miss him!", "Indeed they are. And so are many cats - the farm I used to live on has a ginger tom. He's quite the character and used to visit me regularly!", "This fella is called Oliver. He's a big old softie who is ace at catching gophers. He would bring half eaten ones to my door!", "Oh, I shouldn't be ungrateful, lol! At least he kills them before delivering them. A friends cat used to deliver live mice into the bathtub!", "Did you get a promotion?", "Wow, great job!", "Oh no!  What has you scared?", "It'll be okay I promise.  First few days will be weird but you'll slip in no problem once you adjust to your schedule.", "oh dang thats so horrible", "it gets better with time but it must be hard", "I remember that store! I loved going shopping there, was it your first job?", "Yeah, I bet, it looked like a fun place to work.  Especially for a college job.", "Are you having any specific problem areas?", "Okay. I hope you do well too.", "Interesting, those things are huge, Do they even make them any more?", "Do you have a large family, or do you just like the idea of a large SUV?", "5 is fairly large i would say. I hope you get your giant car one day.", "It is a big change. What is scaring you?", "I hate bugs too. You should exterminate before you move in", "Is it really far?", "oh no. im sorry to hear that", "Well, that would be terrifying! Were you afraid that a vampire was there?", "Well, that would be very creepy! They would hear my scream in the next town over!", "You were ready? That's good to hear.", "Aweomse.  Treat yo self.gif", "Are you prepared?", "I bet. Good luck to you", "Where you supposed to be there? If so, then that is a nice feeling.", "Oh I see. That could make the time go slow also.", "That's great. What classes are you taking?", "That's pretty cool... Are you going to go towards hardware or stick with programming?", "You should go all out and get a EE degree to go with it.  You can do microprocessor design.", "Any time. Have a good weekend :D", "Did that happen tonight?", "Well, it must've been something you said.", "Did she have a party?", "Does she have her license yet?", "Well, there's no hurry in driving, is there? What does she do mostly on her phone? Text??", "Does she play any sports?", "That's super frustrating! I've only ever had outside pets so I can't really offer advice, but it's one of those things where your anger is all misplaced because you know you can't really be upset with the dog since it doesn't know any better.", "It'll be well worth it when she gets the hang of it, but urgh. Bathroom problems are why I don't think I want a kid anytime soon!", "You got a present? How lovely! What was the occasion?", "Well, happy anniversary! What was your present?", "I agree.. Did something happen?", "I'm sorry.. Not everyone is bad.  Just a lot of people.", "That was nice", "Do you have anything in mind?", "So, I take you left to live someplace else?", "Just remember to never invite you ex-roomate to your new place, EVER!!!!!!", "Very nice, congrats on making it that far. I actually was in the same situation about a week ago.  How do you feel you match up to the others?", "I would be upset too.  However, I wouldnt get discouraged though.  There may be another opportunity even better that comes along soon.", "That's great, it's good to see people finish what they start. You must be very proud.", "Well, hopefully there will be nothing but great things for him in his future.", "I am so glad to hear that.  Did he find a job?", "That is good to hear.  What will he be doing?", "Oh that's wonderful! How long have you two been dating?", "It's a huge step, congratulations!", "Sometimes deaths affect us even when we're not really close.", "Guilt can be a terrible thing to live with.", "Is he sick or just being lazy?", "I hope he can get the help he needs and maybe a job he enjoys more.", "Oh, well that's awful on a little person! I never liked it when a teacher did that when a child needed to go to the bathroom!", "LOL, well, that's good to know. So am I!", "Is your patient improving an following good medical advice?", "That would be a surprise.  A lot of people are not dedicated enough to change their condition, especially those with diabetes.", "Thats... uh... strange?", "I think so, you're two peas in a pod.", "Pets are great, but they can be a bit needy for attention at times. It is great, but not when you are busy and trying to get things done.", "A walk will definitely help. He will probably be ready for a nap when you get back, then you can get some work done.", "Oh my god! That's terrible!", "Oh that's so great!", "That's amazing!  Congratulations!  Swimming can be tough", "LOL I bet you use that line all the time!  I love it", "Oh man!

Relationships are hard work.", "That is great of them, did you do anything to pay them back?", "That is nice of you, glad you have supportive friends!", "Aw poor mouse. I have had a few before..We actually rescued a few from our cat :/", "They have live traps to catch and release that are only a couple bucks. Mice really are sweet natured.", "What happened to them?", "Good, sorry you were inconvenienced, hope things get more consistent!", "that sounds like fun. for some reason kids really enjoy cooking.", "that sounds like fun. i want to try to make mozzerella", "Did you study for it at least?", "That is true, well best of luck to you friend!", "That is bad. What did you do after that?", "Did he say sorry?", "What show was it?", "is that the one with Bryce Dallas Howard?", "Oh? What about them?", "That's true. Any memory in particular?", "Is it really? How hot is it there?", "That is hot, but it is a bit hotter where I live here", "Did you feel lonely, or were you happy to have some time to yourelf?", "That is tough when you're not used to being alone.  What did you end up doing?", "Oh that's cool!  What do you all have planned?", "Well that sounds like a fun little trip.", "thats nice to be able to relax", "everyday is a good day!", "Really?

He didn't hurt her did he?", "Oh no!!! Where did you end up going?", "That was so awesome of your mom :)", "Why did they do that?", "That is terrible. Those days, a lot of people do stupid things.", "Children usually do really well, they are versatile.", "I hope he continues to do well.", "Are you excited or will it be lonely?", "Yeah that is scary. I am sure she will do great things though!", "I bet it was really quiet and lonely. Did you find some time for yourself though?", "I don't think I would like that quiet either.", "Well that's not good. I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think maybe you were just too nervous during the test?", "Never be too confident! You've got to give life your all at every step.", "I agree. I dont know why they work in the service industry if they don't like to be nice", "Fast food employees are the worst sometimes... it's like we bother them", "How exciting!!!  I bet you are thinking already about  how you want to decorate it and fix up the lawn, etc..", "I can imagine!  It is certainly an exciting time.  I bet you are just over the moon happy!", "Any experience with what?", "Yes some things", "Are you trying to save money by not eating out at work?", "Well, it can save you a bunch of money!  Plus you gain the time that you would normally spend going out somewhere and you can use that time to have more of a break.", "Oh my! I bet you was so disgusted that you ran out of there.", "Yikes! Why in the world would somebody do that?", "Whoa! That is really scary! I've felt weird sensations like that before.", "No! I'm sure you are not as monster-ish as you think!", "Aw that's nnice of her", "Moms are the best", "Did you kill the snake?", "That is too bad, will you ever camp again?", "Did they do a good job?", "Did you take them out for drinks after the meeting?", "sounds awesome", "i would have loved to do the same", "Did you resolve things?", "I hope you can get over that pain.", "That's awesome! It would be amazing to win a million one day. One can dream.", "That's great. I hope you do! Maybe this time you can get $40. But gamble only in moderation!", "That is really upsetting!", "Well forget them!

Team building, communication, and professionalism will all help a company.  I think this is why so many companies fail.", "Wow, you do really live far from your parents. Do you go to college or work?", "I see. Well, it seems as people get older they want to go back to places which reminds them of past. Nostalgia probably helps them cope with passing life", "I can see how that would be a downer.  Will you still get to see them?", "At least they aren't gone completely, but I can understand how that would affect your day to day work life.", "i would be really annoyed myself, why so many frequent calls ?", "i know ever since i purchased a new car, i know for a fact i did not read the fine print but insurance companys call me almost every day multiple times a day , its really annoying", "I know right! my parents love tennis, so I grw up watching it.", "were you ever any good at it?", "Good for you to have such memorable experience to have and remember of.

The original Spyro is a classic.", "Oh no. What did you do?", "Lol, well done for attempting it. Did you make it to work on time?", "That's great. What made it so special this year?", "Sounds like fun! I'm glad you had a happy birthday.", "I am so happy for you! Congrats!", "I wish you nothing but the best!", "It sounds like you're talking about two different people there instead of just one person.  I'm a little confused.", "Ouch that sucks. I'm sorry to hear that.", "Why what happened? Are y'all on a trip?", "Oh wow, so he basically ghosted you? I would be mad too", "That sounds very bizarre.", "I hope you are okay.", "That is so messed up!", "I hope this doesn't happen again.", "Oh my, what did you do, may I ask?", "That does not sound good. It must have been so embarrassing!", "Oh no, what happened?", "I hate public speaking too!", "Dallas is a really fast city.", "I'm sorry, things will get better.", "What are your plans?", "Thats aweosme!

But hopefully it isnt suffering any more.", "I agree, just remember her for all the good memories.", "Have you been studying? That is intimidating but I bet you'll do great! What's the subject?", "What an interesting course! I hope you do really well. Exams can be so scary- they can cause such anxiety.", "That is very bad. Did you complaint to the landlord?", "I understand. The best thing is to move.", "That's awful! I'm always scared that's going to happen to me when it's raining", "You got lucky for sure!  I can't imagine how scary that would be", "Really, where was this parade at? I'm in Missouri and it was absolutely pouring on Friday", "I usually don't let a little rain stop me unless it's ridiculous!", "oh no. feeling empathy towards them just shows you're normal. There's a lot of people in your boat", "whats preventing you?", "you sound too kind. You'd be a great dog mother/father!", "That sounds fun!  What are they exactly?", "It sounds like you really enjoy it!  Good for you!", "How exciting! She must be thrilled too", "I hope you guys have the best time!", "That unfortunate.  Are you feeling a little jealous?", "I hate it when stuff like that happens.", "Haha, nooooo... don't do that.   There are too many of those people in the world as it is.", "Sounds like the best course to me :)", "That sounds so great. Being in nature makes you feel so good.", "You should just make a plan and do it. It sounds like it is worthwhile.", "That sucks, sorry to hear that. Did you get a refund?", "Hopefully they get your order correct the next time you order there!", "Did it taste good?", "Did it taste good?", "Were you suprised that they did this for you?", "Wow!

What did you do about it?", "Did you get a refund at least? I would never visit that restaurant ever again if I were you!", "That's interesting! Most kids love being home-schooled but I guess she missed socializing and interacting with her peers.", "Not too much longer! I hope she adjusts well and enjoys herself. Public school can still provide an enriching experience when it comes to social skills and education.", "Wow good job! SO close", "Thats a great accomplishment", "maybe you should job a club or a social gatherings group", "i agree. you need to socialize a little bit to get out of your lonely slump", "that should be fun. good luck!", "Aw that's annoying. Work always gets in the way of things. Did you ever try to go to her?", "I'm sure it will work out! Not this time unfortunatly, but it will in the end", "Did he take care of it for you?", "That is great that he was able to show you he is responsible.

Some managers may find it too intrusive and that may leave bad impression on them", "Oh no, do you think she was trying to get back at you for grounding her?", "I definitely remember trying something like that when I was a kid.  I think sometimes kids think they're sneakier than they actually are.", "Whow!  That sounds really disgusting!  What did you do?", "Man, you are a good friend!  I would have been beyond angry!", "So sorry to hear that. It is truly horrifying and i wish and hope for nobody to be hit with this calamity", "Indeed. Friends should be together in times of need.

She's talented and beautiful!", "How exciting for you! Have fun!", "You have a test coming up?", "Well I hope you do well! Good luck.", "That's interesting. What was she doing?", "That's awesome! I didn't know that place was still in business.", "Yeah I bet it is frustrating. The store gets reimbursed for the coupons so they should not nitpick.", "I hope they get better training so you don't have to argue with them about it", "Too old for what? What a strange thing to say.", "That doesn't make much sense. Maybe I am missing the context.", "Oh no, he shouldn't have gambled.", "I would've too, but sometimes people need to learn a lesson.", "Oh no! Did you property get broken into? Or your neighbor's property?", "For real! Are you taking any precautions?", "Inside the restaurant ? What kind of place was this ?", "Okay, that makes more sense then to me.", "Where are you located ?", "I wasn't even aware there was a hurricane.", "Who did what?", "Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. People are so inconsiderate!", "Oh no! Why not?!", "I would make a complaint to the principal if I were you!", "Never know who was?", "Wow that is aweful!", "Oh wow, what happened?", "That would give me the creeps! Has anyone seen anything there?", "I bet it was. I've only had one creepy experience - that was in an old house in West Virginia. I'm very careful to avoid those places these days!", "Good for you! There is nothing wrong or uncool about short hair.", "Great! I'm glad that it worked out well for you!", "That's awesome, I went to visit my parents and my hometown last month, it is a great feeling.  How was the fair?", "Brings back all the memories you had as a kid.  I miss going to the state fair, was always fun.", "You must have been sad and angry.", "Yes first heart brake is so hard, I feel for you, something similar happened to me with my first boyfriend.", "That's awesome! Congratulations!", "No way! That's actually a super awesome prize! Have fun", "Ouch, hopefully its not by much. I remember when i was in high school i had a similar situation. They're usually pretty lenient on it.", "I'm sure your dad wouldn't mind haha, its usually pretty cheap anything i remember they cost like $1.", "Did you try to get the money from him? He sounds like a pretty bad person.", "I do too! People like that make me never want to have a roommate!", "Oh wow. That's pretty scary. I would be horrified.", "Well, at least they didn't follow you. How is Cuba? My parents are from there but I've never been.", "Oh no! That's sad, did he get them all?", "Aw, that's too bad, hopefully next time they will be safe in the coop!", "wow, so what are you going to do with it?", "nice, i hope that works out for you... good luck", "That is gross, I can't even imagine what that would taste like!", "That's so gross, I would take a hard pass on eating that. I like seafood but that's too much.", "Omg, Thankfully he wasn't hurt.", "Did yall happen to get it on video?", "Congrats!, I'm sure you must be very happy!", "Haha brotherly love, I hope him and the lucky gal have a wonderful life together!", "thats amazing i cant wait to have my own one day", "i bet so!", "Is there something that is making you nervous about the upcoming week?", "That can be stressful. I am sure that every thing with go smoothly for you! Just remember that the weekend is only 5 days away!", "We all do stuff like that. At least you didn't lock them inside your car. Done that before!", "Yeah nothing like calling the locksmith and admitting you are not very bright. Haha.", "Did you not want to go out, or did you just not like the movie?", "Just be careful with that. If you feel tired due to stress, it may be the stress talking and not you.", "Great, when will you know your scores?", "Wow, that's fantastic.", "Who doesn't?", "What a jerk! That is definitely a problem!", "That's a real bummer. Do you at least pass the class?", "Well at least you don't have to take it again. Could have been worse.", "Oh no, how awful for you! I hope people helped you to pick them up (and didn't help themselves!).", "Glad you find humor in it! I dropped a bottle of water once, which rolled under the car. I was livid!", "That's extremely frustrating! What were they expecting you to do? It's not your fault your roommate left it trashed.", "Well, I guess the good news is that he no longer lives with you. But that blows, how hard is it to clean up after yourself before you leave?", "That is so annoying. They should not call it that if they can't guarantee 10 minutes.", "Hopefully the food was at least worth the wait. I would have been annoyed as well.", "Oh god! I haven't had a puppy in a long time, but you forget all the things in your house that are not puppy-proof. They find ways to make messes in the most creative ways.", "Yeah, that's a real headache. I'd want to say they're worth it, but on that day I wouldn't be so sure, haha.", "That is a huge blessing, I don't know about you but my life is pretty much keyed into my phone.", "It's almost a shame how much we depend on them, but I know I'd be lost without mine.", "Do they run them all day long - or at night?", "Is there any kind of noise ordinance in your area?  I know in ours unless they are still running them at 11pm, there is nothing the police will/can do about it unfortunately - but I can imagine how annoying it is.", "I don't blame  you because I hate camping.", "Oh I hate ticks and all the bugs.", "What happened?", "You are lucky to have such great friends!", "oh that sucks, i hope it has healed since then", "ouch, that sounds awful", "How come? Have you had awful weather lately?", "Oh I see. Beautiful weather is an excellent start to the day!", "Oh? Big decision. I hope you feel good about it!", "Aw, but they'll always be there for you when you visit. You have to do what you want to in life, after all", "Oh that sucks! What did your neighbor do to get you angry?", "How inconsiderate. People should have more common sense than your neighbor.", "thats awesome, i always loved giving gifts more than receiving them", "me too!", "I hate when I get teachers that are clueless. Makes you wonder how they got the job.", "Well done. You should feel proud for teaching yourself.", "That's always a great start to a day.", "How are you celebrating it?", "Oh wow. What's the exam on?", "That's really great. I am sure you will do well on the test.", "Oh no, what happened?", "Well that is really lucky you were able to avoid that. Hopefully he didn't hurt anyone else.", "Congratulations! Retail really does suck.", "Understandably. My girlfriend is a student and works in retail part-time. She says the same thing.", "Oh, all the time. What album is that for you?", "I really love that album! We will have to listen to it together sometime.", "That sucks. Did she make a lot of money off of it?", "I would've been very angry too. I hope the money went towards something useful.", "I am sorry to hear that. Why was it a bummer?", "That really stinks. I bet you felt really lonely and filled my regret.", "That must feel very refreshing. Would you say you feel content?", "Nice! I want to get that game next week. Looks really cool.", "That is disappointing. I wonder why he's like that.", "I hope he doesn't let you down.", "Something good happen to him recently?", "That's amazing! Tell him congratulations from a friendly stranger.", "Oh no, that's not good! He's not the only one that's not great at French. Most of my family spoke French as a second language when I was growing up and I still never picked it up!", "Hopefully he'll get to enjoy his next summer.", "That sucks. Did anyone get hurt?", "I bet. I would've hid under the table.", "That's nice. Why do you say that?", "That's great to hear. I wish I had a helpful family.", "That's really selfish. Have you talked to her about it?", "Well, at least that's the case. People can only do so much.", "Oh yeah? Why is that?", "Well sometimes that isn't a bad thing really. You didn't enjoy it at all?", "Are the good memories at least?", "At least you have those memories. You should go on a vacation soon!", "Which one?", "I've actually haven't played that series. When does it come out?", "That's rough. Why can't you help her?", "Yeah, I am in the same boat. It's a hard knock life out there.", "How long did it take them?", "He must of been sick after.", "That was probably a good plan to buy them ahead of time", "Wow, thats insane.  I feel like thats illegal", "What was the news?", "Are you going to ground him?", "Why don't you join them?", "Why don't you get another job?", "That's too bad. What happened? Is everyone OK?", "Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. I hoep your family is strong enough to support you through this.", "Holy cow.  Was anything missing?", "Had they gone through anything?", "oh yeah that must have been a good time", "Those are the best times when they still like to play with toy's mine lost interest years ago and I miss it", "that is awesome i will never forget the first time me and my wife went on vacation, where do you have planned to go?", "That sounds like you guys will spend a lovely time over there good luck", "I miss her. You haven't seen your mom in a long time?", "I'm sorry, but I can't understand what you're saying.", "Oh man! I have been there, I hope you didn't have anything special down there??", "Oh lord, i am so sorry! I have been there, that is hard!", "taht sounds like fun, i wish i had coworkers that nice ahahah. did you enjoy the party?", "ahahaah seems to be they really like you working threre", "Aww, I'm sorry.  Is he going to be ok?", "I do too.  That's one of the saddest things.  I hope you'll be OK too.", "wow nice", "ooops sorry to hear that", "oh that sucks.. did someone move it out of the way?", "yea you never like to see stuff like that.", "did you try to find its owner?", "well that was nice of someone", "That's annoying, are you going to talk to them about it?", "I hope it all works out in the end.", "Awesome! Can you say what kind of project it is?", "I hope so too! Projects can be stressful!", "What is the appointment for?", "Let's hope not! My prayers are with her.", "You're welcome. It's always nerve wrecking when family is sick like that.", "I think there might be something wrong with the platform at the moment.", "Oh man, sounds like most kids. She's gonna hate it at first, but getting to bed early will help with her future.", "Well yea, they're young right now and can't see the consequences yet.", "that is so lucky, they must be so happy they bought that ticket", "i know that is such a bomber you must have been so angry hahaha", "What kind of test is it", "Oh I hope you do well then", "wow i didnt even know they had cruises that go on for that long", "yea i wonder how much something like that costs .. i guess if you have to ask you cant afford it as they say", "that is really nice of him, how much time will you have to wait?", "well i hope everything goes well at the bank and with the transaction", "that is horrible, natural disaster are the worst because you cant do anything against them", "not really, the worst thing that can happen where i live is a thunderstorm", "I bet that was a wonderful day", "I am very happy for you", "that is not good, have you expressed your feelings to your boss?", "well i hope everything goes well for you, you will sure find something fitting for you dont worry", "It's a whole new world when that happens, I can totally understand. How'd you cope with it?", "It's always best to just open your mind to anything that could happen. It's the best way to learn.", "Oh no, that's bad.   Have you had someone come out and check the hose?", "May be worth letting your insruance comapny know. Usually they have clauses that you have to tell them as soon as you see it otherwise they won't cover any of it.", "what is that?", "oh that explains it!", "Wow when the child just asked?!", "I'm only afraid that the mom is going to let out that embarassment on her child once they get home.", "OMG that's so gross!", "That would be a memorable lesson to learn. The best lessons are learned that hard way, after all.", "Oh god. That's kinda gross.", "Rest in peace whoever touches that rack.", "Oh dear. How do they let the parents know what's going on?", "That sounds really frustrating. I'm sorry that's happening!", "Oh wow.  Terrifying.  All I think of is Johnny Erricson Tada, who broke her neck in that situation. Did you do it?", "You did the right thing!  Oh fun!  I'm glad you were safe and had a blast!", "Do you feel ready for it?", "Awesome, hope it goes as planned!", "Oh how exciting! Did you take any pictures?", "Awww...that's a bit disappointing, but really cool that you got to see them!", "The market can be competitive if the price is right. They'll sell immediatley.", "That would have been awesome if you got it.", "That's good! That probably means you worked on it until it became something you're proud of.", "Maybe I could learn from that. I get really nervous when I have to do any public speaking, so maybe if I just prepared for it better it would help.", "What did they do to you?", "It happens sometimes. you may ask them directly to pay back.", "I totally get that.  I'm in the same place with my daughter.  I home school and she's learning them too. Give it time and she'll get it soon.  Its so much to memorize at once!", "That's awesome!  She will!  The best thing about homeschooling is that they can learn more at their own pace.  I'm not looking forward to division! ha ha", "Do you hike very often?", "I've never been hiking, really! I'd like to go some day.", "Oh, such fun!  Do you have all the Stamp It Up scrapbooking things I hear so much about? I bet it can be hard to keep it updated! They grow so fast!", "Perfect!  Now you'll be caught up in no time.  I know you'll be so gratified to finish and be able to look at all of them when he's much older.", "So sorry to hear of Sam's passing.", "May your many memories of Sam help you to sustain at this difficult time.", "That is awesome.  I'm with you on that.  Tough times might pop up now and then but life really is great.  I don't like to take it for granted.", "Exactly! You'll go far with that attitude!", "Mmm, now you're making me hungry for cake. What kind of cake was it?", "Personally I'm a huge fan of red velvet, but black forest is amazing too!", "Aww, I know that can be hard, but you can't be too hard on yourself.  Sometimes you don't have a choice.", "Absence makes the heart grow fonder.", "What are some of your best traits?", "Do you exercise often?", "Oh boy that is great news! I hope you didn't drop a pretty penny on it! Haha, and even if you did, dogs are worth it.", "Hey runts are the best! They need love too. Either way, I'm glad you were paired up with the perfect companion.", "I've never been, but it looks like so much fun.", "It would be so much fun to go there as a family.", "Oh yeah I am right there with you, I just don't even go out anymore if I can help it! How old is yours? Mines 2 1/2", "They are too smart for their own good", "what did you see? please don't tell me there was a bug in your bread", "ewwww, so nasty! i almost ate a molded avocado today. good thing i noticed before scooping it", "or maybe she just knows you're a great worker and very responsible? I hope you will get a raise after completing those tasks", "did you try talking to her about it? Just be straight forward and tell you how you feel", "Did you call the police?", "Its horrible to have to got through things like thaty", "That's great! I'm so happy for you!", "Ooh, will you be managing anyone?", "I hear you! I drop things all the time. Was it one you just bought?", "Ugh! Were you away from home?", "Oh wow, she's doing great. I know it probably feels a bit bad that she's making so much more than you, but hopefully you can find  away to be proud of her.", "Oh well that's great! Some people would get a little jealous. I'm glad you're proud of her, I'm sure she worked very hard for her success!", "That is a good feeling!", "Nice! No kids at home?", "Are you afraid of the dentist?", "I'm sorry to hear that, I'm pretty terrified of the dentist myself. Ask for gas! Good luck, I'm sure everything will be just fine.", "Oh nice! That's super brave of you.", "That's a great skill to have!", "That must have been a nice feeling.", "I love that nostalgic feeling.", "Haha, sounds like my pupper, is she still young?", "Right!? It's weird, you buy them all the toys in the world, but they still go after your stuff.", "Why he is working late?", "I understand. Could you plan to do something when he is late (going out with friends)?", "Aww man that sucks for you", "Hopefully! It is your dream car after all", "That should be fun. Any big planes?", "That will be nice to catch up.", "That's not very considerate of her. Was she a bad neighbor while she lived there too? Some people!", "I wonder what could have changed? Either way, I'd be pretty pissed off.", "Oh no! That is terrible!", "I understand. Layoffs are hard. My brother in law has been through a lot of those at factories!", "How do you feel these days?", "It must be difficult, do you think she will come back ever?", "Ouch! That's rather painful. What are you doing now?", "Wow! That's like a paid vacation!", "Wow, that's incredible. What's their secret?", "Congrats to your friend. I hope they share!", "That's unfortunate, hope you don't get it as well!", "I'm sure she will be fine with some rest and a little bit of time.", "Wow... that's kind of creepy actually. Were you able to get it back?", "You're very lucky he was nice and didn't steal any of your data.", "Did you bring them a pan of ludefisk first? What did they say?", "Next time they let you in, just steal all your favorite pieces of decor and replace them with brownies.", "Yeah, they are cute like that. How old is she ?", "I have a 10 year old like that.", "that's amazing. watching your children succeed is so rewarding", "that is awesome. i hope she has very much success in her gymnastic endevours.", "you are very welcome. good luck!", "That's awful! I hope that she didn't mean too!", "Yeah, It really sounds like she didn't mean to. Sometimes you can find copies online if you look.", "I'm so so sorry!  We lost our chihuahua in February, so I completely understand that feeling.  Was he sick prior to passing away or was it sudden?", "I think it might actually be harder to watch our kids go through that kind of loss than to actually go through it ourselves.  Our pup was our daughter's dog and she was sick prior to passing, so we knew it was coming.  Still doesn't really help though.  We ended up adopting a pup from the shelter that had lost her human mom - it was meant to me - my daughter lost her pup and this pup had lost her mom.  It's helped, something to think about at least.", "I am sure she will be smart with it", "You can always show her the ways", "Were they okay?", "At least you're not getting sued", "Im good at that lol", "Don't worry you'll be fine.  It's safe.", "I'm surprised you haven't started to relax a little yet.", "I can only imagine. At least its nice in the day time though?", "I am not sure I would do well in that house", "Bet that brought back good memories.", "Where did you guys usually go?", "whats the competition on ?", "Nice hope you win , ill be looking into this further", "I wonder how that was noted on your report.", "Sounds like a wacky place to work.", "That is awesome. Congratulations. Im sure you earned every penny.", "Good things happen to people who put in the effort. It sounds well deserved.", "Oh no! Do you think it's a wild animal?", "I hope it's not a crazy person or worse, an alien waiting to abduct you!", "Its so hard to monitor that stuff now", "Yeah, that is a scary thing to think about too", "On no!  That is no good!  Is he still a puppy?", "Hopefully he is not doing it out of spite!  Maybe you should hire a dog trainer to see if they can correct his behavior.", "No way? Do you have proof? That is terrible.", "Wow. That is horrible. I would get a camera and try to film them in the act and go to the police. I would be so angry.", "you havent met all three people in the city yet?", "ah well it sounds like i hit the nail on the head", "What kind of job was it", "Sales do sound hard to do", "Is he going to be okay", "I am glad then, I hate to see pets in pain", "That is quite an accomplishment.  Someone like that is really inspiring.", "Hahahaha, it's hard to compare yourself with that, but it really let's you know what's possible if you really want something.", "Why? Were they not working?", "He should have been honest from the start. It's on him not you.", "Do you think your boss will tell him it's you that told on him?", "That's so cool! Do you do a lot of climbing?", "Wow, so a proper adventure then. Have fun and stay safe!", "yea funny how that happens", "well at least its being put to good use", "Hey congrats!  Is it in the same field?", "Heyyy! That's awesome!  I wish you luck! Will it come with a sweet raise too?", "Congratulation. What is he planning to do next?", "Good. I hope it will help her in career growth.", "That's cool!  Maybe you'll get along great!", "lol why do you have to steer clear?", "ahhh.  I got you!  Well good luck on the relocation!", "That is a bad realization to come to.  Where did they all go?", "Yeah, that is tough.  Once you get to a certain age you have to work pretty hard to meet people.  Maybe you could join a softball league, that's what I did.", "It can be hard these days, money is tight", "I bet that was a nice surprise", "Did you get it all straightened out?", "Wow that is awesome, too rare in these times, count your lucky stars!", "Oh wonderful!  I'm glad it went so well!  Did she already know some friends there or was it a new school for her?", "Oh boy, I bet you were nervous.  I would've been too!  Sounds like she's got a great and fun year ahead of her!", "That is just gross!  Have you spoken to her about it?", "I hope the HOA does something about that - that's just disgusting!", "Bet that was a nice calming down.", "Did you get up to anything else fun?", "That sounds awesome, i bet you feel proud! Its nice to do things for kids who are in need.", "Of course! Dont let fear of not finishing stop you from doing anything!", "Oh gross, I would lose my appetite", "Yeah, I would probably just leave the restaurant altogether", "Oh my goodness, that is no fun.  Was it poisonous?", "They can still bite, so it's better safe than sorry.  My father-in-law just got bitten by a black snake recently-not poisonous-but still painful.", "Do you have OCD?", "I just love when the house is clean, makes you feel good.", "That's a bad supervisor. Did you call him/her out on it?", "I hope he got in trouble!", "Oh most are dreading going back to school. What's your major?", "Nursing can be difficult, but if you have determination and a good support system, I'm sure you'll do great!", "How'd it go?", "I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope another opportunity comes up.", "That sounds like fun!  Are you big into biking?", "Mountain biking is great.  Is is really theraputic.  I hope you enjoy your new bike", "That's horrible. What can people do to change things?", "Yes! The weapons thing is so important.", "Oh my gosh! That is horrible! I am so sorry to hear that.", "I understand that. Just give it some time and call when you are ready.", "That's great. Getting good coworkers is so hit or miss sometimes.", "That sounds like a wonderful place. I'm kinda jealous hahaha.", "That's awful! What did you do?", "No. I mean did you yell at the person or anything after they did it?", "Woah that's really bad!! Is it due to cost cutting? They let you off.", "it happens!! i hope you will find a better job with a better company!!", "Oh no, that's the worst.", "I hope you can get it back somehow!", "That is an amazing accomplishment.  What field are you in?", "I'm sure you know that she is so proud of you!  That is really incredible!  Congratulations!", "That is so romantic.  They weren't for any occasion?", "Were they your favorites?", "Oh yuck. Did you get a chance to return it to the store?", "That's crazy! I'd leave it on the counter at the store. Hopefully you aren't out much money.", "Wow that must have been amazing!", "They're going to remember that forever", "Dang, that sucks. Did you ever catch the culprit?", "Yeah, that guy sounds like a jerk. Did your insurance cover the dent?", "Oh wow! My dog Jr died of old age too.", "Oh, Did something happen to him?", "I am sorry to hear that. Mine died of old age as well last month.", "Me neither, but in the end, I really didn't think about him as a dog, he was just my buddy. I hope fond memories of him get you through this.", "That can be so aggravating. Did the company make it up to you for being so late?", "At least they made up for it. If they had not I wouldn't use them again.", "I know the feeling. What team is he rooting for?", "I don't even know what team that is, haha. Football is lost on me.", "Oh that's good, last time my computer broke was a day before I left the country", "I took it to the apple store and it actually got fixed in 5 mins, just needed a hardware reset", "Oh my goodness, is he with the armed forces?", "I cannot imagine how hard that is on the family and the soldier.  While I can't bring him home quicker, I do want to say thank you to you,  him and your family for your sacrifice.", "That is horrible, did anyone get hurt?", "Hopefully you had insurance and somewhere to stay.", "That is scary.  What was it?", "Gosh It's worse than I thought it would be.  What did you do?", "Sorry to hear that. What happened on the test?", "Hopefully next time you will get a better score and study more!", "He must be very smart", "It paid off. Wish I was smart like that", "Oh no. How old are you?", "Is there anyone you could go and visit and maybe stay the night?", "I'm sorry to hear that.", "I hope things are better next time.", "That's great to hear that some really care and put effort in to their relationships!", "Lol! Oh geez- so many take years to get it ugh! But at least he finally has! I hope he is very romantic too!", "Congrats <3", "Not yours? That is so weird, usually they  are on their way OUT not IN! Lol", "Did you eventually get it out? I would have been flipping bonkers!", "That sounds terrifying! Im glad you have a basement though, it can be so dangerous if you have no underground place to shelter in!", "Oh your right, I have an almost 3 year old and I wouldn't know how to explain it as well! That is so hard sometimes because you don't know what to say!", "Oh my goodness, are you alright? I bet you created a mess!", "I hope you can laugh a little about it now!", "That sounds like a great gift. That is going to be a great time.", "Wow. I am sure you will remember this for a long time. You are going to have to think of a great surprise for him now.", "I'm sorry to hear about that. It sounds like, to me, that he lived a long life with you though, and that you were able to spend a lot of time with him. I'm worried for my girlfriend and what she'll do when that happens to her and her dog", "That's crazy, and a little heart-breaking too. I'm envious of the bond and routine it sounds like you guys had. I have yet to develop a bond like that with a pet. I hope I do at some point", "That's so sad...Did you have a lot of good memories in that house?", "I'm so sorry :( At least you have your memories to look back on.", "That was really nice of him. I know that she had to be relieved.", "Someone was watching over her.", "How long had you been married ?", "Hmm. That's a bit of a strange story.", "I hate to hear that. I hate tickets. There are so many other things I would rather spend my money on.", "Yeah, that is such a silly thing to get a ticket for.", "Cool, what are you getting?", "That's a nice car, you are going to enjoy it.", "Neat! We took our daughter and her cousin camping about 2 weeks ago! Did ya'll build a fire?", "That's defiantly a priority! I hope you brought everything that you need. Forgetting something can be a pain", "The 1-6 times as in multiplication?  Teaching children is so rewarding.", "I bet she was super excited to get it all down.", "What grade is she in?", "What kind of school was she at before?", "Where did you go ?", "We went there a few years back. Had a great time.", "Awesome news!  What was the response?", "Oh.  Not so good news then :(  I'm sorry.  I'm sure you'll find something!", "That's awesome, I bet you were overjoyed with it!", "You never know if someone is going to slip and spoil it for you, that's true!", "Oh no!  Do you have any way of finding out who did it?", "Yeah, thieves are terrible.  I mean, who would steal a mower?", "what did you do?", "yea i can see that, it happens but it sucks", "well atleast you watch them with him! i dont like them either.", "Oh no, no thank you! lol ahhh i cant even.", "That'll be tough.  Do you have anything you can do to keep busy?", "I bet.  It's sometimes surprising how much your life revolves around the other person being in the house.", "spray water over there", "thats good, you should", "Could you get with your HR department to see if they can assist?", "What would you do to them?", "Yea, I used to hate it too.", "Like a paranormal type fear or a human with intent to harm type fear?", "is it really hard? or you just have not have that much time to paly", "yeah some people are just naturaly good at video games", "That's pretty impressive, does he have any training or just all self taught?", "Well it's certainly nice to have someone around with handy knowledge like that!", "That is frustrating!  We have a couple down the street that raises hunting dogs.  So annoying all day!", "I am sure he thinks it's his world, the rules dont apply to him.  Sorry you have to deal with that people can be so rude", "Well you must be happy about it.", "Oh! that is bad then.  Be careful.", "I hope you hear good news.", "I understand. I guess you'll always feel that way.", "It was nice of you to buy him food, but I'm thinking he didn't pay you back.", "I'm sorry. I know it sucks to need money and be counting on it, and then you don't get it. I hope he pays you back soon.", "Ugh! I use to have the same problem with my neighbors dog who would poop in my driveway! At least it was my tires and not my feet that got the unpleasant surprise.", "Does this happen often? I'd let my neighbor know about it.", "That's great! You must have been so surprised and pleased to hear from them.", "I bet you had tons of catching up to do!", "The way you wrote that makes it seem like you're anticipating something bad... Do you mind if I ask what you're expecting to happen?", "Interesting... well then at least that leaves the possibility for something good instead. If you're not sure what it could be, then at least it's not some obvious mistake or negligence on your part. I hope for the best for you", "That is unfortunate, my own mother was ill for several years, she is getting older as well. Do you get to see her often?", "Just spend what time you can with her, I'd like to say something really profound but aging parents is a situation that just sucks. Sorry you are having to deal with it.", "That was great of him!", "He sounds very nice!", "Oh really what was the assignment", "It's always great to get back positive feedback!", "What was it like when it showed up on your door?", "Thats hilarious, You finally got it though uhuh?", "Im sure they had a good excuse.", "Oh I see. Hopefully its just that one time where he couldnt get to his phone to let you know.", "Oh crap! how long untill you realized?", "Thats so good, man I have done that a time of two.", "I am sure you will as well. Confidence is great!", "Congratulations. You have done great!", "That's really cool. What kind of car?", "That  sounds like a really awesome car!", "Aww, that's really sweet and sentimental. I like that. Can you still read the words on it?", "I was going to say, yeah, that's the kind of thing I would love to preserve in a frame or something for my office. How cool!", "Who did you go see? And are you still friends with all the same people? I wonder if any of them kept their ticket stubs too.", "that stinks. what did you do?", "and did you find one?", "oh that is awesome. and you got a fancy pen out of it", "Did it went well?", "That is great. What was the issue with your ear?", "you made quick work out of that", "i wish i could unload that fast", "oh goodness. that has happened to me before. i could not sleep", "how in the world did it get in your house? were you able to kill it?", "OOOOOOOOOO NICE!", "Well you two have fun tonight.  I won't tell your parents about all this.", "Why you need to thank her? Is she the one that helped you to find the new job?", "She is very nice person. That is great.", "Oh. Will he be starting elementary school?", "aw he's at that precious age where you have to let his hand go, hu?", "Damn why'd you have to tell me that...Gawd that's freakin sad, jeezus", "I wish you and your fam peace happiness love and good health.", "What? Do you have evidence supporting this", "Good hope that bitch goes to hell...sorry I love animals and my mom's dog died the same way", "That is a big deal.  What are you going to do?", "I would throw trash in their yard.", "He sounds like a real hero though. I hope he comes home safe soon", "I can only imagine. At least you have each other", "Are you and your family okay?", "I am sorry, you can replace it though", "Wow!  How kind is that!  Their really are kind people left in this world.  How did you respond?", "*There* oops.  Did you ever find out her name?  Or find out a way to thank her?", "On no! Did you have to walk, or did you call for service?", "Wow, you got lucky! Did you give him a tip?", "Why did you feel you had to cheat? I am sure you could have passed if you had studied.", "Well, don't let this one situation define you. Use it as a learning experience and move on, and do you best not to repeat it.", "That's so sad! What on earth happened?", "Now that is quite embarrassing! What did your co-workers say?", "That is wonderful!  She must be so proud of herself and I know you are proud of her.  Its great that she likes learning so much.", "Awww, what a great idea!  That's so cute! Where are you guys going?", "You are such a good person to do that!", "It's crazy how the tables turn!", "Why do you say that", "Oh no, were you okay", "Oh my goodness, what happened? Did they find out you owe money to the local crime families? Those bank employees need to mind their own business, am I right!?", "That is absolutely unacceptable. Snitches get stitches, that's what I say. Tell me where they're at and I'll roll up on 'em and tell 'em what for. Just say the word. I've got your back.", "have you asked your friends for family?", "i would def feel that way.its hard when you dont know the person or can trust them", "Oh yeah? And what news might that be?", "Nice! Did he sign up to be a waterboy?", "Oh my goodness, that's terrible!", "What do you plan on doing?", "uh oh. did something happen?", "That must be traumatizing. Most people wouldn't want to go out alone after that. It's understandable.", "Do you think you will get the job?", "I hope you end up getting it!", "Oh definitely, Youtube is a great platform for these talented people", "Yeah, my favorite is watching short comedy videos of my favorite drag queens", "do you think there something wrong", "oh no thats terrible Im sorry to hear that", "Me too! I bought about a thousand dollars worth of tickets last night!", "You and I both! No matter who wins, let's promise to split the pot.", "Oh nice, where are you going?", "Wow, I've never been on a cruise before. I think it sounds like a lot of fun", "Why? What did she do?", "She is a special woman.", "I would be downright furious. Start by smacking him across the face randomly at dinner. That should be a good segway into the conversation.", "Oh, he certainly will when he feels the hot, guilty tears running down his face from that strong, independent, jealous filled slap!", "Was any of your stuff damaged?", "Oh wow! I am sorry to hear that. Maybe you can go find it and sail it to go kill Moby Dick to make up for the damages.", "Exciting! Are you moving to a new company?", "Oh fun! I'm so excited for you. Try to learn as much as possible from this job and ask for career development opportunities!", "Oh geez! What on earth was it!", "That is FRIGGIN revolting!!! I would have lost my lunch right then and there!", "No way. What happened? If honestly, almost all my days are like this. So, worst has become normal for me", "Don't get it personally. Good performance will always catch other's attention. Just continue doing your work", "That's awesome! Always good to be content with life.", "It's good to be prepared for anything because you never know what could happen.", "Definately! I have one daughter and twins on the way... I foresee love overload. How many do you have?", "Thanks, Motherhood truly is amazing", "Not really, do you?", "Oh I'm so sorry to hear that, i hope it picks up for you, maybe listen to a little music to lift your spirits", "Oof, sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do I guess", "Well you tried to make things right, you're still a good person", "i can say that i am satisfied with where i am what i do and what its done for me. are you?", "im glad to hear that!", "What are you packing extra clothes for? Did you go somewhere did something happen?", "What are you packing extra clothes for? Did you go somewhere did something happen?", "What concert is it? Are you excited to go?", "OH MY GOD, I'm so jealous, she isn't coming to my city this time. You're gonna have a great time", "Wow, that will be a busy house", "That's a great attitude, I hope you and your family stay happy and healthy", "What did you lie about, are you going to tell him?", "HAHAHA if anything that is excusable, noone like inlaws!", "How scary! I'm terrified thinking a tornado could pass by here", "Well I hope nothing crazy happens and you guys stay safe!", "Wow, that's very nice of him! Was there a lot of people there?", "That's too bad. I hope you had a blast!", "That's a good idea! It's always smart to be on the safe side.", "I've done that as well where nothing ends up happening but I bought all this stuff. You never know what could happen though.", "Where are you going on vacation?", "That should be fun, what do you plan to do there?", "That must of been horrible.", "I am sure people forgot already.", "What job is it?", "Only one way to find out.", "What branch of the military then?", "The marines is by far my favorite so good for him!", "Oh no that's horrible. Have you complained to the electric company?", "I would too at this point. It might be more reliable.", "That will be no fun.", "Don't you have to be selected first?", "That sucks! i hate losing money as well.", "That's how I always feel at those things as well!", "I do enjoy the zoo and the animals. I think they could be just as good.", "I think it's a good outlook.", "Hopefully one day you might decide to choose otherwise or have a child of your own.", "It's a tough choice to make, and not everyone has to raise a child.", "i can say that i have mistaken something for what it isnt. but not sure about the ready for anything", "almost? so the situation resolved itself?", "What kind of interview?", "Really? That is cool", "How exactly?", "I bet you needed help to take all the presents back home.", "oh my god, how did you get out of there?", "that sounds great.", "That's a great asset to have emotionally I think.", "Yeah it might just be something you're born with.", "I agree. Music used to have soul and good lyrics back in the day.", "Hopefully music nowadays can take a note from the good old days and change their tune.", "how did that go? did it bring back a lot of memories?", "im glad to hear that. sounds like a great trip", "Almost sounds like the erratic weather that we have here in Georgia.  I don't mind the rain as long as I'm inside.  The sun is beautiful but sometimes it can be brutal when it starts to heat up.  Do you prefer sunny days?", "I have to be very careful in the sun.  My allergies and the sun don't mix too well.  I can tolerate the rain much better.  I love the sound of water.", "i can agree with that. i do feel the effects of age creeping up on me though", "def. make the best of them", "It's good to explore your own interests and what makes you grow on your own.", "Hopefully one day you will be willing to explore a relationship in a serious way.", "I once volunteered to pick up trash on the side of the road. It's amazing how much people litter", "I wish. People might have more respect if they were forced to clean up other people's trash as well.", "Are you in a dangerous place?", "I suppose so. It's great that you value life so much!", "Oh no. Did it get ruined?", "Close call. I once spilt tea over my laptop and the keys were all sticky for a while", "Really? So sorry for the lose", "Was she sick?", "That's a bummer. It's never fun to not win.", "Hopefully you'll have better luck next time!", "That's not good, we ended up lucky with who we have", "Maybe you can find another one or go back to your previous company. Have you double checked with the company to make sure everything is ok?", "that's wonderful! I hope you will get that promotion! What do you do?", "Good luck! Whenever you get that promotion we should go celebrate", "I agree, plus I love making snowmen!", "I always get sad though when they melt", "Ouch! Did they try to help you back up?", "Of course! Well, at least you also looked human. We all make mistakes.", "That sounds really scary!  Is your son afraid or is he use to it?", "I would hate that as well. I hope he learns to cope with it.", "That is a lot of extra money to spen, but it is completely understandable it you are that nervous about it.  Have you ever looked into calming medications, or meditation to help your nerves?", "I completely understand that.  My mother in law used to have really bad anxiety about flying, but she did hypnosis and it really helped.", "Wow. That's intense. Did your home get any damage?", "Yeah. I feel for you. It hurts to lose things like that.", "That is awesome.  Happy Birthday!  What kind is it?", "Is that a gaming computer?", "Sorry to hear about that. Are the damages covered by an insurance?", "I understand. It is always difficult to start from ground zero. Good luck.", "Interesting....did you do it", "lol why would he get mad...but did you have fun in the end", "Why do you cheat on him?", "Oh I see, why are you still with him then?", "I know how you feel. Are you also spoiled by amazone prime?", "Haha, I know. Especially when I purchase firearms related things like ammunition. It has to ship ground.  1 week for shipping?!?!   rage.", "Yeah, the US is huge, landmass wise.", "You can always leave them an angry review online", "What did your dog do?", "Oh no, well at least he didnt hurt the rabbit.", "What happened to you?", "That sucks sorry to hear. Are you okay?", "Oh nice! I bet you'll remember that for a long time", "I've never been to a concert. I should go see one like you!", "that's terrible! how does that make you feel?", "That is the reality of life, unfortunately! That's what you have to enjoy life now.", "That is terrible. How long have you had this pet?", "Honesty is vey important. I hope she will not feel too bad.", "Where are you going?", "That is going to be so fun!", "I am never ready. which diet are you trying", "I think my favorite and easiest would have to be Atkins but still alot of prep to get started", "your welcome, and I will check out Keto.", "My kitties are my family too. Animals are the best.", "Exactly! I am glad you have them", "That sounds interesting.. What was it? And how did you find out? And why did he hide it! If you don't mind me asking, of course...", "Oh I see.. Well that's a pretty positive talent then, huh? Maybe you should encourage him to keep doing it. Maybe he misses it. You could get him a present for his birthday or Christmas that was related to drawing tools/pencils and all that.", "how is that working out for you", "practice makes perfect", "omg i would be upset too... how many times have you called them to fix it?", "Sounds like a nightmare! total.", "Does it make you feel happy about your life since then?", "Well at least you'll always have your memories as time goes on.", "that's why i don't watch sports lol we always make fun of our uncle because he talks a lot of smack and die hard Redskins fan", "lol no! you shouldn't! that's the best part! Talking smack to each other", "Oh I know how you feel! I wish there was some kind of hotline where you could report a license plate to law enforcement so they would get in trouble for being stupid with kids around", "Thats awful! People should be arrested for that", "Oh no!  Devastating! I'm so sorry.", "That makes me feel ill so I'm sure you were sick. I hope somehow you make it up!", "That could turn out expensive. Did they need a particular brand for a particular reason?", "That's annoying, maybe they should provide links for you next time?", "How did it go?", "That is great.  Interviews are very intimidating.", "Oh no, what happened?", "There has o be an easier way.  I have always avoided babysitting because I just don't like other peoples kids that much.", "So i am guessing she gave you a good surprise?", "She's must be a keeper then.", "That is awesome.  I have never won anything in my life.  What festival was it?", "Congratulations!  Did you have a good time?", "wow thats awesome.  How did you win them? I never win anything cool.", "aww that stinks, i hope you were at least able to sell them and make some money", "That is crazy! How is he still employed?", "That makes people look bad. I have severe anxiety and still go to work. I get that things are hard but.... its bad to never come in.", "I am glad that you spoke out and shared your feelings. Its not healthy to self harm and pent up your feelings.", "Thats what best friends are for, after all. I hope things have gotten better for you.", "Gesh, that's frustrating. I had a dog that used to do that too. Had to get a trash can with a lid.", "We even had to put something heavy on top of the lid to keep it from getting in it. Hopefully that will work for now until you figure something out.", "That is awe inspiring, very patriotic.  Did you get pictures?", "I'm sure, that isn't something you see every day, or would even expect to see ever.  I'm glad you got it documented.", "Well, that's great. But you probably should study as well. School is very important.", "Yeah, that does sound like a conflicting situation. Well at least you're doing something positive.", "I bought a lite brite from goodwill about a year ago. It was one of the remakes from recent years but we had fun with it.", "Nope, they only know how to touch screens.", "That's great! How long have you two been together?", "You learn a lot about someone when you move in with them, so if you feel comfortable in your relationship I think that's actually rather prudent.", "Oh I'll bet that didn't smell pleasant.", "Oh gross.  I hope she won't do that again.", "Moving is the worst.  All those boxes.  ugh. i hope i dont have to do it for awhile", "I hope its good that she moved in with you.  things must be serious", "That sounds pretty amazing, what convention was it?", "I'm so happy for you, it sounds like it was a wonderful opportunity!", "That is always so much fun. Which ones made you feel the most nostalgic?", "I know how you feel. I feel guilty about indulging in ice cream the older I get.", "oh yea? and what did they get you?", "Oh nice.  Those are fun.  I love playing video games", "Oh yes? What happened?", "Oh, that must have been so precious! We had deer around where I used to live - they're gorgeous creatures.", "That's not much fun. Did he get a new one recently?", "Wow, you're smart and kind! I wouldn't know where to start re. building a computer. Well done!", "What a nice thing to do. You seem to get on very well with your little bro.", "I love my brother, too. He's a great guy. How lucky we are!", "Do you know it was her for sure? That is horrible that you cant trust your own sister.", "That is horrible. It sucks that you have to keep such a close eye on your things in front of family. I would be so mad.", "I hear you! That sounds almost worse then a nightmare as it sounds like it's stuff you miss!", "Thats great! What kind of stuff was in the dreams?", "That has got to be one of the best feelings. I love being complimented.", "You should be proud of yourself. Keep pushing it and work and it will all pay off.", "Dont put too much weight into those advertisements. Sometimes they are just there to get a rise out of you.", "I know that feeling. Sometimes they can really get under your skin.", "Thats nice to hear. Hopefully it makes you two happy.

Hopefully he learned not to pull that kind of prank on you again!", "I'm sorry to hear that. Do you mind if I ask what happened today to make it so weird?", "Oh, I see. I think I kind of understand. It at least sounds like you're a really self-aware person, and appreciative of the small things, and that you have decent perspective on things. The emotions might be difficult to deal with, but at least there are some positives there for you to take stock of", "thats crazy. and scary.  WHat happened?", "im so sorry.  I hope youre ok", "Getting paid is always a good thing. Were you waiting to get something special?", "You deserve one. Did you get it?", "I hate it when that happens! Were they driving fast at the time, it could have been quite dangerous.", "I can imagine, at least you got out of the situation safely", "That's awesome.

I hope you will enjoy it..", "Ah ok. If you try once you will be alright next time..", "That sounds revolting! Have you said anything to him about it?", "That sounds like a good plan. Perhaps you should request a formal resume from any potential roommates for your future abode.", "Did you ask her to stop it or did you have to move away from her?", "That was very rude of her to do that, some people just have no manners.", "That's so exciting! Have you run a marathon before?", "That's good, I hope you do well! How did you prepare?", "What a nice surprise!

Will you watch the US Open?", "It is a great tournament, you should watch.", "So are they telling you good news?", "Oh okay. Well hopefully they give you a chance to breathe and decide what you want to do.", "Ooh how nice! Do you have any guesses as to what she may be making you?", "Well I hope it's good! Your mom sounds like a great person to have a fun surprise for you like that.", "You are so lucky to find someone special online. That can turn out so badly sometimes for some people.", "That sounds like fate? Being that both of you lived close to each other.", "Wow, watching kids grow up is hard. How has she been with the cell phone?", "That's great parenting! You have to trust that your children will make the right choices.", "I am sure with your guidance she will!", "You should go, Otherwise the condition could get worse.", "That is great news! fortunately doctors are there to help us and i'm glad they have helped you!", "Oh my goodness that sounds so bad!

It's very high paced and noisy but that's half the fun.", "Oh that sounds worrisome, do you think you will pass?", "I'm sad to hear that but human nature is hard to fight. Honestly, if you have any alternative options or plans you may have to fall back on them.", "That sounds intensive! How did it go?", "I bet that was so defeating! I'm sorry to hear that. I wish there was better quality control with some of these companies that deal in parts.", "That's a good bright side to look at.", "Did you save it or kill it?", "It's missing a leg so its probably dead unfortunately.", "ooh, I bet you can't wait to finish!", "I hope you get it! Good luck!", "How did they go? Did you pass?", "Wow! congrats, you should totally be proud of yourself.", "That's very sweet! I bet it brought up a lot of feelings inside you.", "You guys sound like you have a solid relationship. It's always great to find those little pieces from the early days.", "Did you get her number?", "Good man, I have a lot of respect for that.", "That sounds like quite the checklist. I'm glad you brought the beer you might need it haha!", "Well I bet you're going to have a great time. With that haul I don't see how you couldn't!", "Holy cow! Did you call him in?", "Oh man!  Do you have a dog?", "How come? And was it a pain to replace it?", "I hope he did a good job!", "Awesome, I'm glad to hear that. Sometimes it's hard to find contractors with good reputation.", "How come you didn't collect them? i loved them myself.", "Well, they are expensive and you didn't really miss much.", "Nice, Was it hard to start?", "Wish i could run close to 5km, i'd struggle with 100 meters.", "That's cool. Man, those tiny disks were easy to lose. what game?", "That's awesome. I get nostalgic about old games as well.", "That sounds horrible, Did you wash it or throw it away?", "That is a really rough story, You should make him pay for another one.", "damn, is he ok now?", "Did he go to the doctors for help? anyway i'm glad he is OK.", "Oh no! Was it a fun night?", "Oh heck! That had to be really scary for them! glad you're okay though!", "Aww, that sounds interesting!  Are you in touch with many people from high school?", "I get that.  It's weird when I forget the name of someone I knew for years.", "Poor thing!  Is he felling better now?  I hope he quit that diet.", "Thank god he is ok.

I love waking up to awesome texts.", "That's so wonderful to hear.", "How did that make you feel?", "I bet. I'm not great at being away from my boyfriend.", "That's great! What have you been doing to socialize?", "What kind of convention?", "That's such a sweet thing to do.", "Dogs are probably my favorite pet. Maybe I should take up volunteering for a dog shelter one day.", "Lil Peep died? when.", "damn, him and XXXtentacion we're really good.", "I love puppies! But they definitely are a lot of work in terms of their hair.", "I understand. Our puppy sheds a ton too and he isnt even that hairy of a dog", "Oh my, that sounds like an absolute blast!", "Did you stay for long? That would be a great vacation.", "What a great time! Is the cottage on a lake?", "Sounds like heaven!", "Oh no! Did you get in trouble?", "Aww, I'm sorry. Hope that teacher learned a lesson", "It's wonderful peace of mind to find someone you can trust with your fur babies! Did you have a nice trip?", "Aw, that was so nice! I'd love to find a cat sitter like that!", "How did it go? What'd you get him for a gift?", "It seems like all those years just flew by, huh.

I hope you don't have to work through the weekend!", "It never ends does it? I hope you keep your head above water though, it's all you got sometimes!", "I feel that pain.

Dont worry about heavy weight if your form is garbage.", "Sure. I love working out.", "How much pain are you on a scale of 1-10?", "Dang that sounds bad! I know you might be frightened of going but I think you should go. You'll be better off for it.", "That was nice of them! I bet you felt really cool hanging with them. How did it go?", "That is awesome! I love festivals, they're always great to unwind and even just walk around talking to people.", "Why not, have you have many temptations?  I know how difficult it can be at times to eat healthy, I struggle to do it too.", "I know, fresh bread is a big temptation to me, and what about sweets and desserts, do you have a weakness for those too?", "It's really a good start to recognized that you should talk about it. We all need someone to just listen once in awhile.", "Oh that's a good friend. I hope your feeling better now.", "I like dominos better", "Dominoes, IMO, has better prices and better pizza. I dont like all that oil", "That's thoughtful of her. Nice to know that your mom was thinking of you in the middle of the day.", "Take her out to dinner! That would be a treat.", "Oh no! You must've felt ashamed. did you return it?", "Hopefully they were understanding that it was accidental?", "Did you get wrote up or a lecture when you got their.", "Its always best to be on time , I hope they understand no one is perfect.", "The journey there is always the toughest, its years of practice and studying but in the end it will be totally worth it", "With whatever you decide in life just know that you are a very skilled and intelligent person! Im sure you will find your path in life eventually with time", "Wow,  that was serious then", "OK,  so what is your plan now?", "Wow that sounds scary.

I'd hate to be the one to deliver such a bad news...", "So sad...that makes me want to cry, too, just hearing about her reaction.", "I bet it does! Do you go by there often?", "I bet it's much different than it was back when you lived there.", "Oh no :( Can you tell me? It's okay if it's too private.", "Oh my gosh I'm so sorry that really sucks. :( Can you talk to the professor and try to make it up or find out what you did wrong?", "Good luck to you!

I bet it felt awkward.", "You are a stand up person!", "Nice, silence is golden", "Full of what?", "Oh no, was it one of those meetings that should have been an email?", "Hopefully you don't get in trouble but I definitely know the feeling.", "Oh really, were you supposed to tell them?", "You can never be to sure now a days, they might post your secret to social media.", "Did you ace your test?", "I always worry when I have to take tests. Unfortunately, I am horrible with tests. I am glad you aced it!", "Nice, what a legend and a gentleman", "Word, you should ask him what the secret is", "That kind of cold disregard for someone you're supposed to love is totally alien to me, the guilt would destroy me.", "Yeah Freud called it Projection, it's too bad people tend to hide their true natures so well.", "It's awful! I know so many families are dealing with similar situation. Sometimes we don't know how to help someone close to us. Heart breaking...", "You can't help him until he wants to really change.

Anything funny or silly?", "Aww yeah, those are great times that you can never really go back to. Sometimes I also wish I could go back in time...maybe you could call her up again and catch up on the last few years!", "It's not fair, eh. Having to suppress those feelings day in and day out is significantly harder than the mundane work itself. At least it's comforting know that most everyone feels the same?", "Maybe if we weren't so attached to being creatures of comfort. Some things we just can't let go of, wouldn't exist without some poor shmuck having to do the dirty work. I guess we're all that shmuck to someone, someway or another.", "Oh wow, what ovie was it and how did it make you feel?", "oh wow that sounds very emotional, I think I would have needed a bucket to catch all my tears.", "I liked my friend very much and believed that he can not talk negatively about me", "May be you are right. But sometimes, you go with your heart not with the law. Murphy's law may not work in every situation.", "Oh no, I am sorry to hear that.

I know I would. :)", "I am so happy for you! Why have you been apart for the past two weeks?", "Awesome to hear that you'll get to live with your loved one soon", "Oh no what happened, are you alright?", "Oh no that must have been a terrible experience, I hope no one got hurt from the shattered glass.", "That's what I like to hear! What changes did you make this semester to achieve your possible 4.0?", "wow. that's awesome! you'll need  that work ethic in nursing school for sure.", "It sounds like you're quite the organized person!", "I'm the same way a lot of the time. It's really a good way to avoid any unnecessary disasters.", "That is so exciting! Best of luck to you man! I doubt she would reject such a great guy like you. :)", "That is great, I would also be surprised if she said no to a man like you!", "I wouldn't worry too much about it. None of it really matters, if we make a difference or not, we all end up dust in the end.", "If telling yourself that makes you feel better, I found all of that to be much more stressful. To be completely honest with you I think people invented stories about the after life to make them more comfortable with death.", "Yeah, 70s were incredible, the dancing the cars, the women had style and the music was incredible.", "But we got to make the best of it, pretty soon elon musk will release flying cars and then life will be amazing again.", "Congratulations on your success!

Yeah I would of felt the same way!", "oh no do you feel ready for it?", "That is great, I believe that you will do amazing!", "Oh that sounds really annoying. maybe you can look it up online or get someone to help?", "Oh I see, well good luck to you, I hope you'll solve it soon.", "That is great, what has been going on in your life recently?", "That is good, sometimes that is all you really need to do, get things done  one step at a time :)", "They looked really exciting! Does it make you want to play it again?", "If it makes you happy then you should do it! Capitalize on that nostalgic feeling while you can.", "That is always frustrating. What happened?", "Wow, some people are just terrible! I hate when people don't take responsibility for their actions.", "What did he do?", "Oh no. What do you think caused him to do that?", "What was it that you accidentally ate?", "Eww that sounds horrible! Were you able to get a refund at least?", "I'm glad it went as planned. I can imagine that to be a very stressful moment.", "You've really got to be committed to go into work like that. It's not for everybody, I agree.", "I know how hard diets are to stick to. What foods are you avoiding?", "Don't be too hard on yourself, it's hard to quit something immediately. Just keep trying, I believe in you!", "I get it. There is always another meal to start making the change!", "Why not? What happens tomorrow?", "Don't let it worry you too much. Just make sure you organize everything you need to present and remember to speak loudly and clearly! You can do it!", "That sounds creepy! Is there any chance someone could start escorting you to your car? There is strength in numbers!", "I definitely recommend getting some mace and a pocket knife. Stay safe out there!", "I hope that all goes well. I am sure he will be good as new after!", "I am sure the procedure will go excellently.", "That's really cool! I bet people really underestimated that underdog!", "That's awesome! Maybe she'll come out of her shell.", "He's a brave man. How was the experience?", "It sounds incredible! Hopefully it helped you conquer your fear!", "Congratulations! Worrying about tuition is the absolute worst panic!", "You're going to kill it this semester! You're going to be so proud when you're walking down the aisle to get handed your degree.", "Did you guys write still write notes in each others' books in high school?", "It's amazing how many feelings and memories mementos like that can bring back.", "That's awesome! Hopefully it comes back in one piece.", "I think it will be fine. I bet the new car runs well.", "Im sure that is tough.  You must really miss him.", "Do you get nervous being on your own?", "Oh that sounds even tougher.  It is a long time but I hope it flies by for you and your hubby is back home again.", "Im sure your not though!", "Thats horrible! Did you get the police involved?", "Yeah i would have felt the same way.", "yeah it unfortunate we have to worry about things like this.", "That's a ton of traffic. I hope they finish their project soon", "That's unfortunate. I wish we could fly sometimes.", "How lovely!  I such it was so nostalgic to talk about old times together.", "That is a brilliant idea.  There is nothing better than catching up with old friends.", "Awe your such a caring and loving person! Are you going to keep it?", "The love and care you show him will bring him joy and happiness!", "Oh wow, that must've been a hard situation. Especially later when you were more in control again.", "That sounds like a good decision. Good luck!", "What's happening this weekend? I hope you have some good things planned.", "That's awesome!

I hope that everyone is healthy and doing well.", "Why what happened?", "Oh sounds scary!  I would have been scared.", "Oh no! I hope she's forgiven you since then.", "That's probably a good idea.", "I'm sorry to hear you were upset! Why did you have to quit?", "Wow that is a long time! Hopefully you can stay in touch with all of your former coworkers.", "hmmn, really?..i guess you must have felt very bad", "am so sorry about that, did he apologize?", "Aww- I'm sorry that happened. Why were you embarrassed?", "It's always difficult when you feel self-conscious - but I've learned that people rarely judge you as hard as you judge yourself.", "Please try to be kinder to yourself! You are a great person- with a lot to offer. Always remember to be good to yourself.", "In reference to what?", "My husband is my most trusted companion.", "That's horrible! I'm a parent and I could never take money from my child. Did you confront him?", "How frustrating! Keep your head held high and be strong. One day you'll be able to keep him from taking your money.", "That's really nice, however, to keep the marriage fresh and strong, I think it's important for you to have outside friends.", "Haha, well I do know the feeling. I guess if it works for you, then don't change anything.", "what did you do???", "well im sure you'll get over it. nobody should make fun of our mothers", "stay hopeful! , they'll release it sooner or later", "it's all gonna be fine and you'll get what u want.", "That is so sweet. It is wonderful to have things that bring back these beautiful memories.", "That really does make it special. I'm glad you have that.", "....what feelings? what are you talking about", "oh man, that's rough to hear from someone older than you. is she ok?", "That doesn't sound very good, but jealousy is a hard thing to deal with", "Other people deserve to have things, too.", "Oh no! When that happens you have to get up and yell, Safe!", "Awww, well it happens to everyone sometimes. Just try to forget it.", "eh not really. what about you", "and what does that mean practically? what will you do differently?", "i love walking in nature. hiking is a great way to exercise and to explore the outdoors", "Oh it's always sad when someone you care about leaves.

Try to relax.", "If there is something in particular, try to deal with it head on.", "that is great.. may i know what you have learnt", "it is challenging i guess.. best wishes that you developed skill over it", "great day to you too", "How hard have you been studying? Exams are extreme amounts of mental crunch time!", "You sound very confident! I wish I had your confidence when I was in school.", "I bet you will do great! What job is the interview for?", "That's a great field. My daughter just got a degree in art but she hasn't been able to find a job yet. Good luck tomorrow!", "Good for you. Being prepared is always better than the alternative.", "Don't get too cocky but enjoy your victory you deserve it.", "Oh no! You must feel really bad. Are you able to fix the problem?", "Please try not to be so hard on yourself! We all make mistakes.", "Why do you need to go to the doctor?", "Oh that's terrible. Did they take care of it?", "That sounds very uncomfortable. Were you honest with them about your change of plans?", "Right.", "Oh I bet that was amazing! I have a memory of going to a waterfall with my parents when I was young and it's a nice thing to think back on. Does your daughter remember it?", "One day she'll look back and it will mean so much to her! Memories with parents are the best ones.", "I totally understand, I hate carnival rides too, they always feel so rickety. Do you have a particular one you fear the most?", "Agreed, a good theme park is nice because you know they have high safety standards, but those carnival ones scare the crap out of me.", "Oh my goodness! That sounds awful! Was this recently?", "I'm so sorry to hear that. Hopefully he has a good team of doctors that figure out what is going on. Are y'all able to visit him?", "That's so scary!  You must have strong intuition", "I'm so glad you came out of it okay.  I hate driving in bad weather and reckless driving just makes it worse.", "It was nice of you to at least think of it. I'm sure she wasn't that upset.", "It's totally understandable. Life can get really busy sometimes!", "Oh, that's not good. Did you get a warranty for the phone?", "I'm sorry to hear that. I hope that everything works out for you.", "Did the other dog provoke him? I wouldn't stress it too much, its just natural behavior for them, take him to training school.", "Oh then yeah, invest in a trainer. I love dogs a lot but an aggressive dog is very dangerous.", "Oh I'm so sorry but I bet that was very special of you to find.", "I would definitely make digital copies and upload to a cloud or a disk in case something happens.", "That's awesome!  Congratulations!", "Nice choice!  Getting a B is definitely something to celebrate", "That's exciting!  There's nothing like listening to your favorite music with great headphones", "I agree 100%.  Sounds like it's time to start downloading some new tunes to test out!", "Oh thats heartbreaking, do you guys already have children?", "I really hope she gets better too, it must be terrible to know you cant have any kids. You're a good man for helping her cope.", "Young love, it's such a bittersweet quest.", "I know right? I wish I was young again sometimes.", "It's always difficult losing a pet.  I'm sure you had a flood of positive memories and sadness than they're gone", "You just have to remember what a good life she had with you!", "Nice! Why do you like it more than other places you've lived?", "That's good! I've always heard that people are closer friends to each other in a small town.", "That's a blessing.  I know a lot of people didn't have a mom like that.", "Is there anything she does specifically for her?", "I'm sorry. I know how that feels. Did you study really hard?", "Oh, okay. Maybe you should ask your teacher for some extra help or find a study buddy. i hope you do better next time.", "That's sweet! I have a great husband too! How long have you been married?", "That's great! We've been married for almost 10 years and I still feel like a newlywed. It's great when you marry your best friend.", "Oh gosh! That sounds frightening! Did you get out the taxi as soon as you could?", "Oh, well that was a smart thing to do. I would've bailed. lol", "I usually love the trips down memory lane, but the sad side of it are the ones who are no longer around. I'm sorry.", "I'm right there with you. It makes you shed a tear sometimes too.", "Oh. I know lying is sometimes beneficial in some situations. Hopefully you did this to protect someone's feelings", "Yeah, I think that means you have a conscience, which is a good thing. If you didn't feel bad, I'd worry about you!", "That would make a funny video! We have a super friendly, playful cat too.", "Yes, they are. He is my daughter's best friend. She can do whatever she wants and he is unphased.", "That was thoughtful, sometimes i think kids fake being scared just to not be alone. hope you didn't get kicked too much!", "Kids are interesting creatures that's for sure. I'm sure you got some cool uncle points.", "My mistake :)", "I feel the same way about my dog.  They're the greatest!", "I don't know what I would do without my dog.  I'm glad you have one that's always there for you!", "Nice! What did you have? I am planning to serve breakfast for dinner tonight.", "Mmmm. that sounds really good! I'm thinking biscuit and sausage gravy, hash brown and eggs...", "I hate when that happens. I bet you meant well but you're left looking like a crazy person! I hope they understood.", "I think they will get over it. Most people understood that not everyone is going to remember every little thing.", "What happened? The yard always has mysteries!", "Shocking! Has your kid done that before?", "Maybe you should find him and apologize right now.", "You could just cook him a nice dinner or plan a special date instead.", "Your welcome! Glad I could help!", "I can understand the feeling, I went through a couple of spells like that in the past. I'm sure they mean well but you're at a point where you're hurting to get back out there.", "You'll return to self-sufficiency soon, you just can't let yourself fall into a pit of self doubt. Stay confident.", "Aww, that's so sad. I'm an animal lover so I understand the pain.", "That's a really tough decision either way. I wish you the best with it and hope everything improves", "Ah what a responsibly to take on! You are a great example, is it quite tough?", "Alot easier than a kitten or a puppy then?", "Keep up the good work!", "I bet you can see the stars and hear all sorts of wildlife at night.", "All that outside noise can become so soothing if you left it.", "Living out in the woods can really make you put things in perspective too.", "Thanks that is quite the offer. How kind.", "Did you wait until the last minute to ask for time off?", "Yeah you might want to look into it then", "Oh no! Have you tried taking your dog to the vet?", "Yes, google has a lot of great information for pet care.", "Well that sounds like a high stress occupation!", "I'm glad you like it. I think it would be hard to get it right every time the way the market is sometimes.", "I wish you the very best with it all!", "You're welcome. Be careful not to chase stocks too hard, they don't always turn the way you might hope!", "I don't know what you can do. A duck is just a toy that taste good to a dog.", "Dogs gonna do dog stuff. That's just how they do.", "That would be bad you should double check before you leave", "Yeah it is better to be safe than sorry", "Why were you ashamed? Did she disturb the neighbors or something?", "I'm sorry that happened. You might need to get her obedience training,", "Thats awesome! do yall have any plans?", "lol maybe yall could find something to bond over", "Yeah we dont thinnk about how special it was until it is gone", "Yeah we all do but we can only go forward", "Have you taken her to the vet?", "You might want to look up what is going on online", "That sucks. Next time they should tell you instead of laughing!", "I'm sure it's not so bad. At least you can laugh about it now!", "That is great! you should celebrate and enjoy this momment", "that is good! I hope you enjoy yourself", "Awesome! What's it about?", "Congrats! I hope it goes well. Are you presenting to a board of directors?", "Maybe you can save more and be able to get one.", "Man that gets to me when someone does that , like they are better than everyone else.", "The holidays are a great time for that sort of thing. What did your family do together?", "I understand what you mean.  I hope you and your family are all able to get together and enjoy each other's company soon.", "I hope you can have you applied or did you interview already?", "well have you practiced interviewing? With that you can feel so much better!", "I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully something better is coming along for you soon.", "Keep working hard and I think your efforts will eventually be noticed.", "Ah that always sucks, did she need to go out or is she sick or something?", "Well it isn't as if she did it on purpose dogs always have a reason.", "Oh no, is it painful and disrupting you in anyway?", "Yeah, I know what you mean it does sound very scary, but they do numb your face and usually they do not pull it out, they fill in the cavity!", "What did you do?", "It has been raining a lot here too. Definitely ruins a weekend planned outside of the house.", "That's good, sometimes it's good to just be lazy inside the house.", "so are you making him a gift?", "don't worry about it you will get it done and he will be proud of it", "Do you have a general fear of flying, or is there something about this trip?", "Have you always had a fear of flying?  I haven't ever really feared it, but I don't like it.", "Was it another boring day today?", "Ohh okay I see, yeah I always get excited when new things happen at work too.", "I know the feeling. Hang in there! tomorrow is always a new day", "Did you hide the wrappers?", "There's very few brands I feel that strongly about. What kind of yogurt is it, I might want to try it?", "I don't think I have ever seen that kind in the store, I'll have to look for it next time I go. I don't care much for the runny yogurt, but I like greek yogurt so long as it's whole fat and sweet.", "That is horrible. Americas government wont be of help....hopefully you have family?", "No cat or dog?", "Yes I love animals and have 3 dogs right now.", "I'm sorry that happened to you and I will take your advice.", "That sounds super scary, could he tell that your were scared or nervous? How did you escape that situation?", "Oh wow, it's fortunate that you managed to get out of that situation alive. I'm glad you made it out of that awful situation.", "That sounds a little scary. Why was he running towards your car?", "Did you give him any?", "Aww, I am sorry, but I must say Pirate peanut butte cookies do sound good, did they help you feel any better?", "Ugh, that sounds wonderful, I would do the same if I were stressed I think", "That's amazing. Were you impressed?", "That must take a lot of practice. I can't even juggle safe objects so I'd likely lose an arm if I tried to juggle chainsaws lol", "Me, too!  I work at the registration department at a college and we're very busy until school starts.", "I think it's the feeling of the beginning of something new.", "Wow that is so sweet of her. She must really love you!", "Wow that is fantastic, she is so lucky to have you around because you are such a sweet and caring person. :)", "Good for you friend! I'm sure you'll find something soon. What field of work do you want to be in?", "That does sound like a really fun job. I also work freelance and would also like something more stable.", "Oh no, they went on vacation without you??", "Oh no that sucks, I am sorry that you had to stay home alone. What did you do to entertain yourself?", "Oh no, I am so sorry to hear that. How are you holding up?", "Yes, I am sure that your cat is in a better place. If you ever want to talk to someone about it I am always here to listen. :)", "The big one? The bar? That's a whole lot of schooling and effort culminating in to one test! I imagine you're very excited, but anxious too.", "Ahh. Still, another stone set on the road to payoff. I wish you the best!", "You study hard?", "Oh no, I bet you aced this one then.", "Oh no, have you talked to him about it?", "Aww man, that sucks, I am guessing that you end up having to do all the dirty work because he has been slacking off.", "Oh I would be pissed. Hopefully you had more so you could fix another plate.", "Guessing he didn't get anymore food for dinner lol.", "I'd imagine so. What a great time of our lives college can be. The world just seems right, being surrounded by your peers, all sharing similar goals.", "Mmhm. I wish I studied more, paid more attention, and joined more clubs. But I guess that's the thing, you're already as busy as it gets, and unfortunately you can't experience it all.", "That is great, confidence is always a key in success! I believe that you will pass as well!", "Yeah I bet! You will do great, I have high hopes in you! :)", "Aw, that stinks. Why couldn't they come?", "That sounds really disappointing. Hopefully, you'll be able to see them soon! I'm sure they were excited too.", "Oh man, I bet you did. I would have had a gag reflex if I saw some one puking at the bar.", "Wow they must have had 1 too many drinks if they could not even get to the bathroom. I am sorry you had to see such a disgusting sight", "Me too, it's so hard not knowing what to expect.", "Right, no one truly knows until they get there, so scary.", "What was the book about?", "I'm glad you were happy reading the book.", "Oh, I understand.

I love that game!", "I saw a machine one time that you could win live lobsters. They would cook it for you if you won.", "Nice! How long has it been since you last saw her?", "Man, I hope you two do something fun!", "All spiders or just the poisonous ones?", "Thats fair I guess, weird fish freak me out more then spiders through", "Wow, is she an older or younger sibling?", "Aww man that sucks, One day your hard work will pay off, so don't let it get to you too much. I am sure she is not intentially doing that", "omg! I hate cockroaches, they are ugly insects", "were you able to kill it? what did you do?", "Well done. I hope you dont find anymore, they are scary.", "Wow! that is really cool. Did he land the back flip?", "What prompted his back flip?", "It happens sometimes.  It only becomes a problem if you forget often.", "I hope they were pretty understanding.", "I hate burger king! McD's all the way", "Adding mac sauce to a cheeseburger is a game changer", "That is unfortunate, did you fail the test?", "You got this! I believe in you!", "Wow! Did you tell them anything?", "You should stop being their friend!", "Oh, snitches are no fun.", "I would just keep to myself.", "Who?", "Well I think as long as you say sorry, she can forgive.", "I know how annoying that can be.  I love dogs but they certainly get do annoying things at times.", "Maybe there was something outside or maybe he just wanted attention.   Dogs behavior can be hard to figure out sometimes.   Good Luck!", "I have done that before. It is not fun.", "I hope you threw out those pants.", "Ooh, what kind of trick did she learn?", "Aww! I wish I had a dog now!", "American football or soccer?", "Okay. I'm not really a fan of it.", "Yeah, that was a surprising result.", "Does it make you feel like you're living in an alternate reality?", "it can be scary at times. How do you deal with it?", "That is a good way. I have a dog that makes me feel safe. Do you have anything like that?", "You can watch some movies", "It depends on your preference. I watch korean dramas.", "Life is always a lot better when the sun is shining.", "When the sun is shining walking and seeing the beautiful sights makes me smile.", "That is good you have someone to share your happiness and problems with", "my best friend is my boyfriend. So I share everything with him", "Same here! where do you volunteer at?", "That is so generous of you! have you ever thought of joining a volunteer organization?", "what are those", "??? is it a cancer of some sort??", "That is excellent! I wish I had the courage to do so, too.", "I think it would be fun to help someone build a house.", "oh yeah? was it because you didn't know if you could do the work, or because of all the hot college girls", "well how did it go? did you do well?", "That must be nice. I wish i had one.", "Yes, they do. And lots of care.", "What about it made you feel nervous?", "Yeah I understand. Big life changes make me feel uneasy sometimes too.", "I lost my dog last year, I miss her too.", "I agree, they are the best.", "That must feel good.", "Small things like what?", "Wow thats completely unfair!", "Well i mean sounds like favortism to me. Siblings always get the better things", "Wow, lucky you. I play those once in a year only", "I do not play too much because if I do not win, I feel it is a waste of money.", "well that's good. what's the subject?", "I hate chemistry because I think we should leave all that stuff to nature and just live our lives as the animals we are", "do you have a good teacher?", "Wow that is annoying.

What were you guys talking about?", "Aww that's so sweet <3", "He must be a good person bit if he's a stranger, is it safe?", "That is good safety first", "I am sorry to hear that! what was its name?", "That is cute! is there a meaning behind that name?", "That is good! Never accept anything less!", "I'm rooting for you! Get your dream person!", "I can imagine how it feel,more so if its someone who never leaves his/her phone down.", "The writing is very clear on the wall. You have been ignored.", "Wow, that sounds intense! I hope you'll find out there was nothing to be stressed about after all!", "Well I hope you won't have any of those mean teachers! Maybe you'll have some awesome ones?", "that's sounds amazing, you", "you didn't talk to any of them during summer break? is there anyone specific you're looking forward to see?", "I feel you.

Does the old man appreciate it?", "You are a good example to others.", "Sounds like a great friend! Do they just listen or offer helpful advice?", "Loyal and caring. You've got a winner on your hands!", "good to know. and what makes you life so good, huh?", "what if it all comes crashing down on you!", "Did your mother find out?", "How have you managed it?

Maybe you'll get another chance to win.", "Oh wow, well there is always another chance, we all learn on mistakes.", "I am not much of a gamer myself. What is your favourite game?", "You need to save your money to be able to afford it.", "I can sympathize with you. I've had a lot of betrayal in the past. The ONLY thing to do is to continue looking for trustworthy individuals.", "Not for naught but, a dog won't ever betray you <3", "oh my god, did it take a lot of work? and did it annoy you when it fell down?", "maybe this time you can do it somewhere alone?", "Same. I hate my life. I sit in front of my computer all day", "Well I hope things turn out better for you", "why do you do it?", "oh I see. what do you want to do instead?", "That's unfortunate. Did you make up afterwards?", "That's good. You guys are siblings after all and should try to get along.", "hi, what makes you think that?", "fair enough my friend, would you say your chances are high because of signs of other people winning around you recently?", "Could she just be too distraught to pick up a phone? I agree that she owes that much to you but, maybe shes too broken atm", "Hopefully you don't live too far. I know this is a random chat but, I genuinely hope your father is okay. I don't have a dad so, cherish every moment you get.", "Golf is by far my favourite hobby, this sounds awesome! What island was it?", "I will have a look at it on my lunch break today!

But have you confessed to her", "well that's great news congratulations, how long have you known each other?", "that's good that you put a lot of effort into it", "haha, amazing! did you get shouted at?", "That's really embarassing! did any of your friends poke fun at you for it?", "What happened exactly? Is it just old and moldy?", "At least you got your moneys worth! Are you going to have it installed?", "That is so lovely", "Memories are good to be kept in the medulla. Good old days. You really had a good time", "Aw. When you know, you know. How did you do it?", "I bet it was really special though! Christmas is such a beautiful time of year. When are you getting married?", "That's too bad. Do you have proof of infidelity?", "It's good that you're faithful. Too bad your boyfriend couldn't be less flirtatious and respect you more.", "What kind of food does it serve? Sounds wonderful!", "Surf and turf! That's what they called a steak served with seafood. It's very yummy!", "That's good, I love relaxing outside by a pool.", "That's always a good feeling.", "oh man dogs are crazy! My dog killed a cat recently, I hope it's not poison!! Is he okay?", "oh no, you are a good dog owner though", "Sounds like you are doing all the right things. Did anything go wrong?", "Oh that is great! Congratulations on your knew home! That must be so exciting!", "that's the coolest thing ever I didn't know you could have them as pets", "My kids would love something like that", "Monkeys!!!??? I have never heard monkeys howl.  Tell me more.", "Where do you live that there are monkeys in the mountains?  I live in Florida, the flatlands. lol", "Sounds exciting.  But I would have been scared of howling monkeys too.  I am not sure why, but the term howling monkeys makes me giggle.", "Bye! Watch out for those monkeys!", "oh that is so exciting!!! good for you man!", "yeah pop that champagne!", "That sounds awesome! What's your favorite part of your vacation so far?", "What kinds of fruit do they have there?", "That's great that they let you work in exchange for lessons. I bet you have the best memories.", "That's awesome. Do you own a horse now?", "That's awesome! Yeah I definitely find the more I study, the better I do. Funny how that works!", "True. There has to be a work/school/life balance.", "Well I hope he gets to felling better.", "You should keep an eye on him older people are more prone to getting sick.", "That's very considerate of you. I know some people that drink it all and don't replace it.", "Lol it happens, what's important is that you learned and care enough about your people to internalize the knowledge.", "Awww, I never had one, but wanted one.", "What were your favorite games?", "Wow, thats terrible. Did you get him to pay you all back?", "Well good riddance. If you never want to see scum again, just loan them $20.", "I'm sorry. It sucks when you put time and effort into studying but the grade is bad. Could you get help from your teacher or a study buddy?", "Well that's good news. I hope you do better on your next test.", "Aw, I know that must be hard having to take care of yourself so far from loved ones that you can depend on.", "That's good that you are keeping your options open and even better that you challenged yourself to leave comfort and travel.", "Oh no! that's horrifying in high school! I hope you didn't get made fun of.", "Kids can be so mean. Thank God that's all behind us now!", "Holy crap! Is there not a landlord or something you can complain to?", "I'm glad I never had to live with other people. I would not be as patient as you.", "Did you pass?", "Absolutely. Great job!", "I completely agree, having complete control over your diet is amazing and has a ton of benefits", "Yeah, and it can be cost effective if you plan wisely!", "Oh my goodness! That is scary! Are you alright? Did anyone get hurt?", "Whew! You are lucky! Glad to hear everyone was ok.", "Oh no, poor dog :( I'd be devastated too, i love dogs so much.", "Don't beat yourself up over it, it was a very tragic accident but who could've known. He's in a better place now.", "That was nice of her. Did everything work out?", "Oh no! Did you guys stillhave a nice evening?", "Yeah I thought of that. well, the kids probably loved it!", "Very nice.  How many shoes do you have?", "Are they all Yeezys?", "That sounds so nice!  Are you very far from grocery stores and stuff?", "Yeah, that's not too bad at all!  Sounds idyllic!", "Oh yes.  The first car is amazing", "Yes I remember the freedom that comes with the first car.", "I feel exactly the same way.  People should be more considerate and be on time for the sake of others.", "Yes, that would certainly give them a taste of their own medicine!", "I agree, it's something I struggle with as well. Have you tried an diets you liked?", "I've tried a few, and I would have to say the one that I liked the most was Weight Watchers. It's pretty easy to stay on, and the food is usually good. The only big problem is that it gets expensive.", "That's so cool! Did they get you anything nice?", "Time to go shoppin lol!", "Aw Im sorry. Are you doing better now?", "That's a good idea. I haven't done that in years. I always feel like I barely dodge a bullet by not getting it.", "Glad you are doing better!", "I feel you, but at least it should be shorter than driving and the odds of a mishap are much lower than regular transportation.", "I see, I think you may consider a tylenol or some type of sleep pill for the flight, to ensure that you don't feel uncomfortable or paranoid during travel.", "That's awesome. I was always a daddy's boy growing up.", "Amen. Mine was a good man. He taught me a lot of good life lessons.", "I am sorry your dog passed away, I totally understand wanting to keep a momento to remind you of him. Was he old when he passed?", "I'm glad you have something that helps keep his memory alive. :)", "Aw what a sham! Did they give any reason why they hired from the outside?", "Well that's a good attitude to have. I don't blame you for being mad. I would be.", "Oh man, that is exciting! Do you know what kind?", "That's awesome!! I love jeeps!  congratulations, that's great news!", "That's so sweet.  What kind of bird is it?", "Aww, I'd love to see a video of that.", "You're lucky the cow didnt hurt you.", "Good thing you listened to your gut feeling", "Hopefully it will stop soon. That's the worst having to get creative with the little food you have on hand.", "Well that is what they get paid for. Just be sure to tip him well.", "Uh oh. I bet he knew he was in trouble. Did you get him a crate?", "Yeah, I'm glad you didn't do anything you would regret. I hope he is better for you in the future.", "Oh no! I'm so sorry about that. Don't blame yourself, animals like to play with each other!", "That sounds like a good plan. You definitely don't want that to happen again. Sometimes bad things happen in order for us to learn and avoid it again.", "That sounds great, I can remeber going fishing with my dad at that age. Did your 4 year-old have a good time?", "Wow, that's impressive! I'm glad he had a good time.", "Poor doggy! Did you have to take him to the vet?", "I bet he did, I'm glad he's okay though.", "Thats really nice you have a friend like that.That's hard to come by. I hope everything is better for you now.", "I'm sure he doesn't expect it but thats a really nice thing he did.", "I hope you arent and I'm not too! It would be rough living on the streets.", "It would be terrible in the winter.  I cant imagine sleeping outside when its freezing", "That sounds fun! Where did you go?", "Mmmmm, I love greek food! That sounds appetizing! I think I will take my girl there too this week!", "I'm so sorry you feel that way. Maybe you should talk to someone you trust. A family member or a friend.", "I'm sorry. You could seek out a professional to talk to. Or you could just try meeting some new people.", "What kinds of pets do you have?", "oh wow! you did say a ton! I love animals too. wish I lived somewhere I could have more.", "Did he have superpowers?", "That's pretty impressive.", "Oh wow, are you going to be in front of anyone important?", "Usually, you are the one who notices it the most.", "wow, that must be an interesting thing to be involved with. lots of milk too, i presume.", "very cool, wish i could get into something like that. sounds fun", "Awww, I understand. Dogs are sooo great to be around and they are super friendly.", "Maybe also looking into getting a new dog, I know it's hard, but you can get through it! Your friends and family are always there as well.", "That sounds like such an enjoyable life. If only it was so easy!", "Haha, that is true. But we have to make the most of this one.", "Oh man heart breaker. Thats good yall are friends though. You never know maybe one day yall will be married", "you dont still have any feelings at all for her?", "Ooh, I've always wanted to learn how to do that. You must be so excited!", "Omg, that would be awesome. I might just have to learn how to do that myself.", "Ooo! That's exciting! Congrats on your baby! I hope your guests enjoy their time.", "Yay! That sounds like so much fun. Baby showers are a great way to bring everyone together.", "Usually it will let you know if something is wrong. Part of how we are designed!", "It is, everything has to be balanced just right, or else we feel it.", "Oh no, how did you make things right with the manager. I am sure he is just wanting to get paid.", "That is a tough spot to be in, maybe you could of washed dishes for him. Or give him your phone for collateral.", "That is good, such an embarrassing situation to be in.", "Oh man I want that too! did you get it?", "Do you use your computer?", "How much do they go for?", "thats not bad. I have a rx 280", "Moving, is always such a pain. Did it go smoothly at least?", "That's good, glad he wasn't having too tough a time.", "Oh man, I can't stand barking dogs. I wish owners would do something to shut them up.", "That can make it so hard to sleep at night.", "Aw man, childhood is full of good memories! I love the smell of strawberries.", "Haha, clearly strawberry. Sounds like you had an enjoyable childhood!", "Your neighbor doesn't do anything about his dogs?", "If it were me, I'd call the animal shelter and report possible abuse since the dog does nothing but bark all day - poor thing just needs attention and the owner isn't taking care of it.", "Really depends on the person I think. You can't have good people without bad people.", "Agreed!", "You are very lucky my friend. There are so many children out there that cannot say the same, sadly. But so happy for you!", "I guess it all comes down to karma, if you believe in that stuff...... I do. :)", "what did you end up doing?", "It's good to have a partner.", "I have a son, it's definitely nice to have some peace and quiet.", "You must have been very happy when they returned home.", "Did you get it?", "That's disappointing. I feel sorry for you.", "That sounds like a bummer. Hopefully, you did not lose too much.", "Yeah, but it is a good thing to hear you did not lose too much. Some people put all the money on the line.", "Hey, that's awesome! I hope you get it. When do you hear?", "Well I hope you do. What kind of job is it?", "You must have been relieved you were able to help. Did all go as plan?", "That's awesome! I'm glad it went through without a hitch!", "Oh, that's terrific! What a great feeling that is, to be appreciated and valued!", "Oh, I love that you are so happy for her! You sound like such a supportive and loving partner!", "I also have two older puppies, training takes time and care and love.", "Puppies are smart believe it or not, use treats and don't yell or punish for their mistakes. A change of tone and placing them outside works really well.", "i remember the lite brite toy. it was a nice toy to have.", "i agree, the toys now days are made cheaply and of poor quality. everything is about video games.", "Moving can be stressful for sure, hopefully you had some help?", "It's like christmas! only you already know whats in the boxes. the best part about moving is you can have a fresh start on organization.", "That's not good!  What did you do to try to get him to listen again?", "I bet that worked!", "Oh man, i'm about to eat dinner over here! lol that's pretty gross. My cat pukes up stuff all the time so i can kind of relate.", "I bet, hope the dog is feeling better though.", "interesting, what was the issue?", "oh man, that is an issue, i hope he grows out of it", "I bet you cant wait.  WHere are going for your vacation?", "Miami sounds like a great place to go for a vacation.   I wish I was going with you!", "That sucks! What were they upset about?", "It sounds like a very challenging environment to work in.", "That's exciting! When will she be moving in?", "Does she live far away?", "That sounds very frustrating.", "Hopefully you'll able to get it all sorted out soon.  I'm sure when it's done it'll be a beautiful house.", "What happened?", "I've never tried VR, but just imagining that is scaring me away from it.", "Congrats!  How exciting for you.", "That's a long time to hold out hope.  I bet you were shocked.", "It always takes time. Hang in there It will all work out.", "I bet so too!  Good luck to you both.", "What subject did you choose?", "Nice choice. I guess you have good relationship with your brother.", "why was the officer yelling at her?", "wow, that's unfortunate. i would feel embarrassed for the lady", "That's so wonderful. I love being cared for when I am ill.", "It is an amazing thing to have a loving mother. Everyone should show more appreciation to their moms.", "Sorry about that, you could have taken a taxi", "good enough you got home safe", "Did you have a good childhood? You must miss a lot of things.", "Yes. Nostalgia is unavoidable when we look back on our youth.", "That's unfortunate. But at least you learned from the experience, right?", "No need to feel ashamed. We all make mistakes and at least you learned your lesson.", "That's nice that you helped him. I'm sure he appreciated it!", "Yes, it really does. I am sure if you get sick, he will remember and do the same for you!", "Wow! Were you hurt? Was anyone else hurt?", "That's good news at least. I hope you are feeling better now. And don't be hard on yourself, accidents happen.", "Oh that's great, its awesome when the kids go off to school each year.", "You'll get used to it and begin to appreciate your quiet time, haha.", "Wal-Mart is a place where weirdness always happens. Can you tell me what happened, I'm dying to know!", "Do you think he was panhandling you for money or a person who really needed it? Did you give him money?", "That must have been a very windy day!", "I bet It will teach you.", "I go to church every Sunday I love it.", "The people you can meet are super.", "That", "That is really not thing. I wish more people would do such nice thing. I know that made your day.", "So you don't like to be alone. I am so sorry that affects you. So what would you do?", "Yes, usually when one relocates it's hard to make new friends, but eventually it will happen.", "That was really nice of your old friends.", "Happy birthday. What was your favorite gift?", "Nice. What brand of shoes were they?", "That's terrible. Were you able to identify the kid?", "I'm glad he was able to catch him.", "Wow, how was it? I have never seen that trailer.", "Aww, that is so sad to hear. He must have made some great movies!", "Are they twins?!", "Awww! Twins seem like a handful but also very exciting at the same time!", "Oh, I'm sorry. What happened?", "I can imagine that you did want to run and hide. Sometimes husbands get us into all kinds of situations.", "I've been in that situation before. Did she find out about it?", "Well that's all that matters. If she was okay with it. I'm sure she was happy watching the episodes with you, even if you had already watched them.", "That sounds like a bit of work. Are you adjusting to your place now?", "That's what's most important. I'm glad everything has gone well.", "Oh, I'm sorry. Why didn't you get to go with him?", "Oh, that's too bad. I know exactly how you feel. Hopefully your husband will watch your son another night so you can go have some fun.", "Was it a lot of fun?", "That's great, but you don't have to wear a fancy dress to be beautiful. I'm sure you're gorgeous no matter what you wear!", "It's ok, just try your best to remind yourself how beautiful you are and practice self-care as a habit.", "What a great feeling! You must love your dog.", "She sounds like a great companion.", "Are you looking forward to it?", "Exciting! I'm sure you'll do fine.", "Why is that?", "Wow, that's no good. I hope they get it worked out soon.", "I can't play those kinds of games. Too spooky for me.", "That would keep me up at night.", "Oh my gosh that's insane. Well, I'm sure you'll be able to control your impulses in the future.", "I've been there before too. The important thing to remember is that there is always another chance to make it right tomorrow.", "Aww, sounds like he is teaching the puppy. That's so sweet.", "Yeah, sounds like a pretty smart pup.", "I do understand, I have a son myself. You just need to be patient and continue trying.", "That is awesome. I am proud of him", "gotta risk it for the biscuit", "i feel ya but sometimes temptation is good gets the heart pumping", "It can be nerve wrecking. I'm sure you will do fine, though! Have confidence!", "You know they say, imagine them in their underwear...I wonder that really works. I'm not fond of public speaking either.", "Did you spend a lot of the time on the project?", "I wouldnt get discouraged.  Maybe talk to your boss and see what you can improve on next time.  I'm sure, at least if you have a good boss, they will want you to succeed and guide you in how to do better.", "Nice! Enjoy it! I like living alone. It is so peaceful! I get lonely somtimes but for the most part it is great!", "Yeah, but they are all just a phone call away. Keep your head up, your girlfriend will be there soon!", "Oh I know, mine too! I love how all the colors change with the setting sun.", "It reminds you of how beautiful life is.", "Wow, that's rude! He won't last long...", "Yeah, some nerve on that guy. He should be grateful to have a job!", "Oh wow! Congrats!! How exciting!! How far along is she?", "LOL Right!!! It's way too hot to be pregnant right now!", "You are so awesome!!! I wish I had  sister like you when I was pregnant.", "I've been in that situation before!  It can be scary", "I'm glad it worked out in the end!  I wish people would be more careful with their dogs.", "Oh, no. Did you take it back or keep it", "The store might not take it back at this point if it has been to long.", "That sounds beautiful! What emotions did they bring out of you?", "I'm sorry! What a lovely memory to have of her though. It's good to still have things in your life that remind you of her.", "Oh no! That's so sad. I'm so sorry, I know you must feel like crap.", "I understand completely. I have things of my grandfather's that I can never replace.", "Sweet! Where did you go?", "That would be awesome to have the whole lake to yourself! My guess is the weather was nice too if you guys got to use the boat most days!", "I've had similar experiences.  What do you end up doing?", "Have you ever had a positive experience from that cycle?", "oh no! hope all is well with your dog.", "Good to read. Always great to find a vet you can trust. Looks like you did.", "BBQ sounds so good right now! How was it?", "Well that's kind of disappointing. It's always a let down when you go out and it isn't is good as you were hoping.", "i completely agree. though, i'm remote so i am never sitting in the same room as others so i can distract myself ;)", "lol. it kinda is. i moved about 3 hours south of my office a few years ago and since even at the office my work involves connecting to remote data centers it hasn't changed my job any.", "That's terrible! What did you do?", "That's good. I'm glad your alright.", "Oh no! That's so sad. You must've been so upset.", "Hopefully you didn't and hopefully the other kids didn't make fun of you", "What kind of car was it?", "Oh I bet! My husband wants an older car when we can afford it", "OH NO! I would be devastated. Did he pass, or missing?", "I am so sorry. I am sure you are. I would be devastated if I was in your shoes. Does she have a chip? Maybe someone will get her to a vet office.", "Good job! How do you think you did on it?", "That is a good feeling. Time to celebrate before the grind starts all over!", "Yeah I like going straight to the point too", "I like when I get places earlier than expected", "I understand that completely! Did you have to get any work done?", "That sounds scary! I always avoid going to the dentist until I absolutely have to. I know that's pretty bad!", "Oh no! I hate when that happens. Was he afraid or just didn't want to sleep?", "Ugh, that's the worst. That happens a lot with my son as well. Hopefully he wasn't too cranky today!", "That is wonderful! You must be happy, shows that he is getting bigger, soon it will be college", "College is when the tear will start to flow. I love children.", "That will be fun. What a great way to relax and unwind", "I saw the weather forecast. We only have a 20% chance of rain so you know how it is here. We'll be good.", "That must be hard to do, he wants to be beside you. He is going to miss you.", "Yes he needs to so you would have to ignore him at nights.", "That is so sweet. What is her name?", "I can just imagine she sleeps in your bed sometimes. I love dogs, I would like to have a dog someday.", "That is very cute, the little one probably couldn't hold its bladder as long.", "That was very smart of him, maybe he remembers back to his puppy days.", "That's good. How is it going?", "That's great news! It sounds like he is enjoying his new freedom, and was ready for it.", "I'm glad you didn't hit the dog!  Did he jump out at you suddenly?", "I live out in a rural area where people don't always have control of their dogs.  Sometimes those little ankle-biting dogs will start chasing the car and they make a break for the car and it makes one really fearful that you'll hit them.", "lol, guess you were pretty hungry", "yeah, might wanna go replace it", "That sounds amazing. What's your favorite beach to go to?", "Those are the best. Especially the white sand crystal clear water beaches.", "i sure it was beautiful", "really, i wouldve never thought that. i have a friend who is in Dubai on a teaching assignment", "yuck, how gross!!", "lol right, they could easily be your neighbors dinner", "Oh my gosh, I am so sorry for your family.", "I'm sure she can with all the technology and modern medicine now. She's got this!!", "why do you live so far from family", "i would like a new life. i totally understand", "what? that scary", "wow, a hard lesson", "I understand!  I live in the country and have the same problem.", "Yes.  The only company available out here is Century Link and they just crash randomly all the time.", "That is very cool. What took you all around the world? What was your favourite place?", "What interesting stories you must have! I think that would be really neat, but settling down is probably good too.", "That is so sad.  I hate it when pets die.", "yes.  they do like to have lots of  babies", "I am going on a trip to Peru to visit Machu Picchu! I can't sleep because of the anticipation!", "I hear it is a very spiritual place to be and full of beauty and history.", "Yes, my friends are coming with me. :)", "Congrats! Did you do it because of football season?", "Cool! Whats your favoirite? I like the office.", "I have never heard of Mr. Robot actually.", "Same here! I am glad you are doing well! :)", "I hope these feelings last for you!", "A puppy!  That's so exciting!  Are you going to keep it?", "I don't know that I would be able to give it up.  4 is a lot, but what's one more?", "Well I'm sure he will be, most guys are. I'd never get to  do anything if my girlfriend didn't trust me.", "Everyone gets jealous, It when you act on unfounded stuff that is the issue.", "Yes sometimes people do stick their noses in where they do not belong", "Yes.  Especially men who want to mansplain things to you.", "Wow!  How much did he win?", "That is awesome that he gave it away!  Maybe good karma will let him win again.", "Good choice. You could have broken down and never made it to school.", "HAHA! You are super lucky you are smart. Lol", "Everyone handles stress differently. My anxiety gets so High I sometimes cancel my plans.", "I go to a psychiatrist and take meds, It just fixes what your body doesn't make, or do properly. It helps so much.", "Oh no! It will be ok. It seems everyone in life has to go through that at least once. Everyone gets through it!", "Sometimes you need those times to make your realize how special having a job is. Gives you perspective.", "I hope everything is fine, How did it turn out?", "Im happy to hear that, a sick child is always a scary thing.", "Neat. Where are you going?", "Sounds exciting. Have fun.", "Oh wow, are you feeling super envious?", "Ha ha, I don't blame you! Hopefully you can get the car you want soon though.", "I 'm glad to here it will be fine , but what was wrong with it?", "I 'm glad you was able to pin point the problem and I hope he stays in good health.", "Wow, that's so mean of them to laugh at you! At least someone pointed it out eventually, right?", "That's embarrasing. But hey, I think the best way to get over moments like those is to just laugh at yourself! Don't beat yourself up for it.", "Wonderful I bet she is really content if everything is perfect. Love to hear that someone is doing well.", "I understand but try not to be jealous. Good things will come to you to in its own time", "The waiting must be very difficult and nerve wracking.", "Things like that make me antsy.", "A new haircut can do wonders! I always feel like a million bucks after.", "I bet you looked great! Those compliments would've made me feel good too!", "Oh? What specifically were you talking to her about?", "Haha! Well, as we mature, we learn so much more about ourselves.", "Haha you are a good father. I hope you can make it through it!", "Oh my gosh! I'm sorry! haha Thats funny. Atleast you have them a story to always remember.;)", "Oh no! So what did you do?!", "That's nice of your neighbor! Your boyfriend should've told you that there was no toothpaste earlier. Maybe there would've been time to get some. But at least you didn't go to work with stinky breath, right?", "Haha everyone has to do that once. Can you tell me a great story about the party?", "Hahaha thats funny. I hope you guys are still on good terms. To be honest little holes sounds like an easy fix.", "Wow, cool. Maybe you can ask to tag along?", "That's too bad. Well, at least you have something to work towards and plan as a goal for yourself.", "That's amazing! How old is she?", "Wow, that must've been a big thing for both of you.", "I am sorry I do not know what nclex is but I wish you good luck", "O ok I hope that everything works out for you", "Wow! Did you try to get it out?", "That's amazing! He probably loves you so much", "Do you feel nice and refreshed though?", "I did the same thing today, so you are not alone in your behavior friend!", "Oh no! Did it break?", "Oh, that really stinks. I hope you were able to get another one.", "Did you do some neat doctor stuff on it?", "Oh yea that sounds like you did a good job!", "That is good, how long did it take before you go him to this point?", "Yeah i understand, it is good that you took him there though", "Wow they must be doing well. Why dont you try to get one?", "sounds wasteful to me. life isnt about material things anyway.", "Yeah sometimes kids say things that they really dont mean in the heat of the momment", "well maybe you guys should talk", "Ugh my neighbors do that sometimes. It's the worst! I think some things should not be allowed to be cooked unless you live alone.", "Ick. Hopefully the smell is fully gone now", "Oh that is the worst feeling! I hate using the restroom in public as is.", "Maybe.  For me I just don't want to cause a stranger to be embarassed lol", "I am with you, i like it a lot more than summer personally", "I feel that, I hate being hot. In the winter I can be comfy and I can always just put on a jacket if I get too cold, but in the summer it is not that easy.", "I was very nervous. I did not know if I would pass or not.", "Did you pass the test?", "I am the same way, I barely make anything compared to a lot of people I know", "I think cities are more expensive, like living costs, so I do not want to live there ether personally", "I'm assuming that he/she didn't return it in time. I'm sorry.", "Oh, I understand. Did it bring it to you at all?", "That is amazing!  I'm really happy for you!", "It sounds like you really deserve it!", "that does sound terrifying , are you feeling better ?", "at least your ok, thank god for that", "Nice, for what position", "That's pretty great, you must really take the initiative.  Good job", "You're much braver than me. I would never host a dinner party.. don't feel like I'm good at planning, and don't feel like I'm interesting enough to talk to a bunch of different people.", "I think, maybe, yeah! It depends on who's there, and if I felt comfortable with the host. If I felt like I had enough people to kind of rescue me and who I could talk to at the party if I got anxious and couldn't talk to strangers, then that'd be alright. Other than that, I just kind of do like maybe a group of 4, max", "Aw, that's too bad. You did the right thing by telling her though.", "Maybe you could save up and purchase her a new one.", "I am right there with you!  God is good and wow, He's been with me through so much hardship.  I'm so happy you feel the same way.", "Yes, we can always count on Him to know the bigger picture and have faith that He's working for our good.  Hope you have a blessed day!", "They really have changed. I know exactly how you feel and love thinking back to the time.", "Those were awesome! My favorite was the coke commercial at Christmas time. So many memories!", "Oh fun!  How big was it about?  Did it have neat markings on it?", "I think I saw someone post a picture of those online. Maybe it was a lunar moth! What a fun experience!", "What is your nieces name?", "That's amazing, was it your sisters first baby?", "It will be amazing!  I should do that too!", "That sounds so great!   I hope your plants grow beautifully!", "That sounds like the perfect remedy for feeling down. Getting out in the sun and outside the house/bed is so good.  I'm sorry you're struggling with depression.  I understand.", "I am so glad!  You know what to do to help your body and mind and that is good self-care.  I try to do that as well as meditate and pray in the morning.  Really refocuses me.  I'm glad you're feeling better!", "I imagine, are you prepared for it?", "Oh yes, last year with huracan Irma we went without power for 5 days.", "Aw, did it bring back a lot of good memories for you?", "That's awesome. Sometimes I wish I could be back in my childhood. Maybe if only for a day. ha ha.", "I am sure it'll be ok. Usually if you stay in contact with them and don't blow them off for a long time it will be OK.", "I would call them. They usually give you some credit for that.", "That's good. I assume you have studied hard and are prepared?", "Good luck! You will do great!", "Haha, I'm sorry but I had a little laugh at that. It reminded me of the time I did that to my teacher in school. I was embarrassed, but it made me feel better to find out that it seems like it's a common thing that happens, since they're female authority figures that you can easily mix up.", "Yeah, she knew what you meant. She probably forgot in two minutes, while you've thought about it for much longer. The best thing to do there is to just show off your sense of humor and ability to make fun of yourself and not take yourself too seriously, which it sounds like maybe you did.", "That's gross, why are they coming in?", "You should probably avoid feeding them if you want a clean house.", "I sure wish it wasn't. I live far from my family and they can't even make time for me to go to them. So I feel for you, it is very sad.", "Absolutely first. Especially when you don't live close.", "I bet it wasn't Comcast! They wouldn't even give you a cup of water for free.", "I am glad you had a nice experience! Its difficult to find such a company that cares about its customers!", "Oh, wow! That is crazy, have you talked to the vet?", "I thought it would be normal. Good thing to be cautious.", "Well it is a good thing you unplugged everything!", "That is a good lesson to learn early, I am glad everything turned out okay for you!", "That sounds amazing!  But terrifying too lol", "I admire you!  I don't think you'll regret getting this experience", "Hahah that is funny. Were your parents angry?", "Haha did they believe it?", "nice, what system do you play on?", "i really enjoy video games as well", "That's the worst! Have you tried talking to your neighbor?", "You might try contacting the authorities, though I don't know if it would help.", "thats awesome! its really cool to be able to keep things in the family", "did he enjoy the toys>", "Yeah that can be nerve racking! How did it go?", "That is good! Are you guys close now>", "Good job! Do you feel pretty prepared?", "WOWZA! Congrats! Is it a job you can build a career out of.", "Oh thats good! Thanks for teaching. :)", "My mom is one so i know how important you guys are.", "Man.. i need some of that luck!", "Wow thats awesome! i never win anything like that", "I agree! I wish I was able to make things", "For sure you are born with those types of talents!", "That is cool! I love flash backs from the past especially when it comes to television. I sometimes watch old shows on youtube that I used to watch as a kid. Love it!", "I used to watch the Wonder Years after school. I love watching it until this very day.", "that must have been embarrassing, I hope you weren't to traumatized", "that is good to hear, it was a motivation to succeed, a great character building", "Aw man that sucks. It must have been a crazy storm.", "How big was it?", "You shouldn't think about death whilst you're alive! Just live each day to the fullest.", "Yes but death comes to all of us someday. So I think its best we enjoy our life whilst we are blessed with it.", "That is a good test of friendship.  Did he keep his word?", "It is such a blessing to have good friends on whom you can depend.", "Nice! I hope you get it, I'll cross my fingers for you also! Do you think you got a good chance?", "That's all you can do, but if you worked hard, I'm sure you will get it!", "Oh cool. Were there any good picture in there?", "Well that's nice. I am glad they were happy memories for you.", "Oh boy.  I've gotten quite a few of those before.  New hairstylist?", "That's odd.  I would've told him so and asked for my money back.", "Ohhhh, disgusting.  What did you do?", "I bet, what a terrible feeling!", "Oh man, your making it even worse.  I never even thought about that.  Now I want to throw up.", "is there anything that you can do to help prepare yourself?", "yeah i can understand that!! id want to get it over with too. the sooner the better", "Oh my, I hope that doesn't mean more workload for you.", "Maybe you should ask for overtime pay just in case you do get more work!", "Yeah, flying can be scary.", "Hopefully it isn't a long flight.", "thats awesome that you trust her", "its hard to find good people you can trust with your kids nowadays", "Oh no! Thats horrible. Were you driving?", "Oh Gosh that is horrible. I am so sorry that happened to you.", "That's the worst! Because now you'll be freaking out trying to think of the things you may not even remember whether or not could have been there. That must be an anxious feeling.", "Yeah, I'm not quite a hoarder or a packrat when it comes to those things, but I do get sentimental with some physical objects. If I lost them, I'd feel like it would be an itch I couldn't scratch, because I couldn't replace what I lost. Hopefully you can work past it somehow.", "Oh man, thats the best feeling in the world. Getting out of a shower especially if its into clean freshly laundered sheets.", "It's such a wonderful feeling, I should take a shower soon too.", "How did you you go over your budget?", "I hope you can have better self-control in the future.", "awww. that is good news!", "how long has it been seen youve seen each other?", "Oh gosg. Do you have some greedy roommates or something?", "Hahahaa good point. Maybe try hiding your groceries.", "yea i have", "thats great, happy for yo", "literally me right now actually", "must be nice to have someone that loves you", "What is going on with your work?", "You can do better next time I believe in you!", "Ouch.  Why?", "Oh I see.  Very interesting that your faith makes you want to die though.", "its not so bad, it can be intimidating but you just need to figure out the campus layout and classes but its very smooth from there", "once you figure the way it just becomes routine", "You are so right, did you read that somewhere?", "That is cool, have you studied any philosophy in school?", "Yes, I feel that every day.", "I wish people understood how precious life really is.", "Why did you throw your laptop?", "Sometimes I lose my temper like that too.", "wow thats vivid, what game was this?", "ah yes league, love hate relationship with that game but after 4 years it can really still tilt me more and more", "Oh no, I hope it wasn't an important meeting.", "Sorry to hear that, were they understanding about it?", "I'm sorry your wife is sick.  What kind of soup is it?", "That sounds quite delicious if I must say.", "Yeah.  reminds me of the good old days!", "Yeah same here.  I remember one time awhile back I took some pictures of when the aliens landed in my backyard.   That was some good times!", "Yikes, that's a tough one and I can definitely feel your pain on the job market. I think either network your way to a higher pay job (depends on connections) or possibly go back to school to a doctorate or certain specialist degrees.", "Yes but the market is quite flooded with CS degree holders. It's hard to get something unless you are specialized I think. Unfortunately I don't see society changing any time soon.", "Life is the most beautiful thing.", "I live every day like it's my last.", "Waiting in line is the worst.", "I hope you got your classes.", "Sounds like you are pretty confident in yourself!", "I agree that it is as well. In most situations, it can work to one's benefit.", "I don't understand what you are trying to tell me. Is this a joke?", "Why would they want to do that?", "I can imagine the flood of emotions.", "I hope it was worth visiting.", "Sounds like you are prepared. I like the confident attitude. Go get them!", "I would love to come with you to yours. LOL, I just invited myself.", "I completely understand. Maybe you need a vacation to recharge the batteries.", "Are you looking for a new job?", "That's not true I'm sure. Do you have any friends to hang out with?", "I can understand. Maybe connect with some like-minded people online?", "ewww that's gross!  Did you help clean it up?  And what was in that pizza anyway??", "He seems like a good friend.", "The future certainly can be scary.", "I am curious for what the future holds.", "Oh wow, the whole cake? Has she found out yet? Was she mad?", "If you can and have time, I'd try to get a quick replacement and explain to her. Maybe she'll understand.", "Oh cool.  How does it work?", "Oh that's easy peasy.  Sometimes I only have to wipe once when I go number 2.", "Oh man, I would be so jealous. When will it be your turn?", "I think your boss should give you more recognition in that case!", "That's good!  You're awesome!  Family is what is important", "I agree!", "ready for all those ice breakers? those amazing crazy party? what are you hoping to do this year?", "yeah defiantly, my best advice to you is to learn and focus on your studying and always expand in knowledge that's the one thing we seniors always wish we had done", "what? what happend? why are you angry?", "really? was it about something very stupid?", "I think that's a kind of natural reaction, especially if it is just a hobby. I would have a fear of being judged.", "Definitely. I feel the same speaking foreign languages. It's more of a self-conscious thing.", "that does sound like fun! where do you guys plan on going?", "that sounds like a good time. not the usual country you see people vacation to", "That's awesome! It's so good that you have such a positive outlook on everything.", "I think you have the perfect outlook. I hope I can strive to maintain something like that as well.", "what did he do yolo?", "this is absolutely the worst! he is no man in my eyes!", "Oh, yuck! That's gross. Did you get sick too?", "that's rough! My husband always did with the kids when he was home.", "don't be! i know this is overused but trust me, it's not as hard as everyone else makes it to be, if you focus and aim for your goals, you will get it! i know you can do it!", "don't be, i am sure your fiance will always be right next to you and help you out", "It really is, what can we do to help?", "That'd be a good idea, we could all start biking.", "What was the project?1", "You must be an expert on nutrition then!", "What are you looking forward too?", "Which country? that sounds fun, are you guys doing anything fun there?", "yeah. it would be best to check the website for a list of approved items", "yes. hopefully all will go well", "Are you his best man?", "I hope he does, being the best man is an honour and you're ready for it.", "sounds quite interesting to code", "oh dang i never really dabbled that deep when i did my small share of programming", "What happened?", "I hope all goes well so you're as happy as possible.", "That's good! I hope you had a good time?", "Yes, it's great when you run into an old friend you haven't saw for a long time.", "What are you planning on doing with it?", "That sounds so admirable, I'd love to see you grow to an amazing person.", "why don't you go get yourself some food? or just order some?", "oh god i get you! waiting for your food to arrive is real torture.", "wow, spooky, what did you do next?", "that must have startled you", "You having money problems?", "I don't think I've ever had a delivery guy be that late. I'd be mad.", "Oh, that stinks...literally! I have pets too so I know how you feel. My cat will eat too much sometimes and throw up!", "It is, I wished they could just use the toilet like we do!", "thats good! nothing wrong with hard work and dedication", "that does have to feel really good", "Yes, where do you live?", "I love Colorado. I visit all the time.", "Yeah, we have a lot to be thankful for.  We take for granted many of the perks of being a US resident!", "I agree. There is a lot of suffering.  I am glad people like you and I recognize that.", "That is great. Where are you selling your popsicle?", "I understand. Good luck.", "You were probably just being you.", "Haha! That's usually the case. : )", "I understand. Is your family living far from New York?", "It is always cool to have family and friends close by.", "That is a great mindset to have!  You must feel very happy and content!", "Why do cities make you feel that way?", "Oh no.. and no one really likes pumping gas.", "You could grab it when shes done with it and fill it up real quick for her!", "Did you give it back or just walk away?", "Yeah, that is a hard one to deal with.  Maybe you should give it back so you will not feel bad about yourself.", "I would ask the realtor on some background and even google the address to see if any abuse headlines come from that place.", "Kinda makes you think even more since its such a good deal that people are just like get rid of it - deff look into it!", "I'm sorry to hear that...sometime you just have stop and take a deep breathe so you don't get overwhelmed.", "Therapy is a good thing. Its is nothing to be ashamed of.", "Maybe it isnt your body, but also your partners! Something to check into to see which end its coming from, but none the less it will happen!", "It's hard to trust anything, even the oatmeal recently was put on the news that its high in cancer causing pest spray.", "Thats kind of you, did everything go well when you put it back into the wild?", "Sounds like it went well!", "Yes, I hate those kind of people. They have nothing to do expect lying about other people.", "I just ignore them. At some point, they stop but they understand that it is not working.", "I'm sorry to hear that. I hope he is feeling better.", "It is. Taking care of sick child is hard. Missing work is also hard. The things we have to do for our children.", "Sounds like something on a movie! What a work day right, my god. Bring extras next time? lol", "I bet they were lol atleast you can laugh about it now.", "That's very sad, has he considered getting help for his addiction?", "I can certainly understand your feelings, I hope he can somehow fix his habits.", "Has it been a lot of fun?", "Oh yeah I remember those old Halo days too during my childhood, such a great game.", "I understand that feeling. It wouldn't make sense for us all to want to do the same things, especially if you've partied before already.", "That's cool that you know what you want from life right now and that you don't feel obligated to do things just because of norms.", "Oh that's great! Does it come with a nice raise?", "Do you kind of feel like there's no where else to go?", "I am so happy for you! All of your hard work paid off!", "That is great accomplishment! I wish you well on your new path in life!", "Oh my...I hope you didn't hurt yourself.", "Since you didn't hurt yourself I think I will have to laugh. It sounds like it was funny.", "Yea, I feel the same way.  It's worse when you have to pass by them twice a day.", "Heck no.  Be envious that they were lucky enough to have their parents hand down all their money to them.", "Oooh, how exciting!! What kind of car did you get?", "I'll bet it is! Best of luck with your new truck!", "Indoors?", "In the 6th grade? Where is this school?", "Makes sense. I live in the states. We have no money for such things.", "How big a bird was this. I dont remember anything from the 6th grade.", "Wow!! That's crazy. I'm like that though. I never win anything either", "haha right! Maybe you should buy a few and see what happens. You cant win if you don't play", "Oh god, I am so sorry. Is he okay now?", "I hate to hear that. It is so hard to lose a pet. I hope you are doing okay through this.", "Do you not fly often? It isnt too bad.", "Well if it is a bigger plane it isnt as bad. Just bring some headphones and listen to some comforting music.", "You have to be more careful next time, maybe you need a calendar to remind you.", "I am so sorry to hear, I am glad that it didn't cause a lasting effect.", "That is a fantastic feeling. I hope you get it.", "Keep riding that confidence. It will get you places. It sounds like you deserve it.", "That must have been a bit scary, You should have called the police.", "You cannot be too careful these days, i am so sorry that happened to you.", "Okay! Now that is interested, I would love to see them.", "Oh really? I will be checking it out. I would love to have some.", "Free? That makes it even better, I will be getting me some posters.", "I hope so too. Thank you so much!", "I am afraid of spiders. I would run and scream. What happened afterwards?", "I would move out of that room. Maybe you need to spray the area.", "Oh no! Did it end up raining? Did you take rain gear?", "That sounds like it was a lot of fun!", "Im sorry to hear that it can be hard ;/", "Yeah i would get a pet", "That is so sweet of you. I love cats, you must be a caring spouse.", "The cat didn't like you, oh dear. I am so sorry that happened. You need to spend more time with the cat.", "I have heard that is a common side effect but you might want to talk to your doctor about it", "Well you could always work out and turn it into muscle", "Its a good guard dog then", "What kind of dog is he", "Animal accidents can be really bad!", "At least no one else was injured, but it is sad about the cow.", "Just cherish the moments", "It will be okay", "What kind of job is it", "That is a nice job I am sure", "Uh oh! Did you get in trouble?", "That is good that you gave it back and were able to admit your mistake. I am sure they appreciate that.", "Awesome, congrats! I'm not too familiar with the Oculus Rift, is there a particular game you're eager to play?", "Robot games are always fun. I bet you'll have a great time!", "Ooh how so? Were there a lot of hills and sharp turns?", "I see. Do you think you'll be going back on that bike trail?", "I hope you have tons of fun and enjoy a safe trip!", "What kind of con was it", "that is really cool! I like in Texas so i cant go to stuff like that", "That sounds amazing!  How did everyone do?", "Awesome!  Hopefully what you guys learned in the ropes course translates over into the workplace.", "Why did you do tht?", "That makes sense, you are a good older sibling!", "I would imagine, that is a lot to drink!", "I get that, well I hope you feel betternow!", "why is that?", "I get that, did your friends know how to ride bikes?", "Well it is never hard to learn if you give it a shot", "Aww that's sweet. Did you cry?", "Why hold them back? It okay to cry lol", "Oh, I am so sorry! I used to have a dog we loved so much who had diabetes...we gave him insulin shots twice a day but we lost him. I can relate to how you feel...", "Our pets are our family...it's not easy to see them suffer..I feel for you. And thank you about our dog.", "Oh no,  what happened?", "That is terrible, you must have been devastated,  I hope he find the help he/she needs.", "Oh dear, but are you allowed to sing at work? That must be so annoying.", "He needs to just sing in the shower. Tell him to quit singing.", "Haha no way, I thought that only happens in cartoons!", "I'm sorry but I probably would have, too. Hopefully you didn't get hurt though!", "That is unfortunate, is he doing any chemotherapy ?", "Well I hope everything works out for him!", "What were you waiting for!", "Nice!  The anticipation must have been killing you!", "How well did it work out for you?", "Wow!  That is such a great feeling!  I love when good memories come back to me!", "o no what did you do?", "o no im not sure that was the best response", "Oh No! Did you get hurt?", "I bet that was a little embarrassing.", "Don't be embarrassed. You know that you had a problem and you are better now for it", "That's understandable. I wish you the best in staying smoke free!", "That is great to hear that things are going well for you.", "I am sure that things will continue to go smooth since you have a positive attitude about it.", "How long has it been since the interview?", "Oh well congrats and good job!", "Oh that is awesome for your friend!", "Yeah I can understand that. I would feel the same.", "That was probably not a good idea, how did it go for you?", "Well, you never know if you can do something till you try. I am glad you were able to do so well.", "That can be kind of scary. How did it go?", "Awesome, congratulations! It just goes to show how great things can happen when you're prepared.", "Good job.  Your coworker sounds like a shady little b**ch did you let him/her know what's up", "For real.  Glad you had enough self-respect to handle it, most people dont'", "Aww haha how many bags did you bring", "Heey there you go...sounds like you're the resourceful one", "That sounds awful!", "Have you tried talking to them about it?", "I don't think that I have seen/heard one of those since the 90s... Possibly the early 2000's at the earliest! Crazy, I didn't know that they still exist either!", "I loved that too!", "That is wonderful to hear, good for you. There's way too much craziness in the world making people unhappy. It's nice to hear someone is doing well and happy.", "Distancing yourself from the negative things sounds like a totally healthy way to insulate yourself from that stuff.", "Aw, that must have brought up a lot of nostalgia for you.", "Did you share it with anyone else?", "Nice, a step up is always such a relief. Do you feel confident you'll get the job?", "Well I hope you get it. Good luck!", "That's great. How long are you going to have to wait?", "I am glad you are so confident about your prospects. I hope you hear something very soon from them.", "I think we've all been there...I've done my fair share of dumbassery", "Ha YOLOOO", "I know right! I noticed leaves on the ground the other day and got all excited! Is autumn your favorite season, too?", "I don't mind winter either but you're so right, the temperature is just right during fall.", "Awe, sorry to hear that. I am sure you did better than you think.", "That is a good attitude. Better luck next time!", "I was doing the same thing!  Hard work but so satisfying when you see the results!  Who is coming to stay?", "I completely agree.  Mine can get trashed in 10 minutes flat from the kids.  ha ha. Oh, how fun!  I hope you have a wonderful time!  Yeah, you'll probably be cleaning all over again by the end of it but its worth it.", "That sounds pretty disturbing.  Have you called the cops?", "I bet.  I wonder what he is thinking.", "I certainly hope so,  Why do you want to move?", "That sounds great, That is how I like my houses to be too.", "Hmm, don't you need fat and protein in your diet also?", "Oh I hadn't even thought of avocado. Well good luck with the diet, I hope it works for you!", "Oh wow! That is a brave thing to do! Your letter must have been a little intense if you are worried how they will take it. How did it work out?", "Awe that is great! I am glad there was a happy ending!", "Oh man I'd be mad too...you should wait outside with a paintball gun", "Yup gotta lay down the law", "Terrifying! What was it?", "Oh good. I bet!  I wouldn't have been able to go back to sleep after that!  Do you have to replace the pump?", "Oops. I hate when that happens. Did they say anything to you?", "That was really nice of you to apologize like that. Some people would have just ignored it. I know that could have been embarrassing.", "that sounds exciting! Do you bike a lot?", "Doesn't sound corny. We all need a hobby to relieve stress!", "How come you can't take them anymore?", "Awww, well maybe you'll have grandchildren that you can take one day!", "That's intense. I hope you did well!", "Congratulations! That's great news. Well deserved", "I totally understand. The same thing happened to me last week. I thought I was going to lose it!", "Right, I had to end up calling the homeowners association on them", "Wow that is very clever. I would have never thought that could happen.", "That is incredible. I wonder what else you can train him to do.", "That is great! Hopefully he continues to be", "Lol i'm sure you have to put up with him as well so its even", "Oh no. That's so sad. Was she sick for long?", "I'm sorry. At least she had a good long life.", "That is awful! Did you have insurance to cover everything?", "Yeah that is horrible. I am sorry that happened to you.", "Oh no! I hope you didn't get into too much trouble by doing so!", "To be fair, everybody makes mistakes and it's bound to happen even to the best of us!", "Sounds like that could be fun if you like your brother and if you like parties. Do you want to go?", "Happy Birthday! I'm glad you were able to have fun and be surrounded by those that love you.", "What was her reaction to that", "I am sure she will forgive you", "That sounds like some nice relaxing quality time", "Have you ever passed out together watching tv?", "How old is your baby?", "And how long have you been married?", "that is exciting! will it be your first house?", "that is no good! hopefully yall will find a better one", "You must really trust your friend! How did that turn out?", "Good to hear that it went so well. Do you think you'll let your friend watch him again?", "Oh no, what did you do?", "Don't worry, from what you said it doesn't sound like you almost ruined it. It wasn't something on purpose at least.", "Lol that makes a lot of sense?", "well that sounds fun!", "Haha caught red handed!", "Yeah, I wonder what their bathrooms are like if that's their service", "Don't worry about it you will do fine. Kindergarten isn't too hard. Just don't eat the glue.", "Oh I see. My mistake. I was wondering how you could type and spell so well for a 6 year old. Well good luck in college!", "Did he try to get another diploma in this profession area?", "That is a good news. I hope he get it.", "Surgery on my kids always scares me but I have heard that it is best to have them taken out while they are young", "I understand, when it comes to our kids and being worried about them it feels like time stand still", "Oh for sure. I hate having to cook and do dishes after a long hard day", "Were at work today or doing something else?", "Interesting. How do you feel about it? Do you find it fun and interesting, or wish she were more responsible with her money?", "Yeah, I can understand that. Sometimes when you're not in a position to enjoy yourself because you're busy being tied down with responsibilities, it's easy to get mad at others. Whatever you can do to spin it positively, I would suggest that. Being negative about it will only make everyone's lives worse.", "Oh my gosh!  That had to be super scary!", "Yeah, thank god you are safe.  I don't know what I would have done if that happened to me.", "Yep I thinks its disrespectful and petty. What happened?", "Thats good. I am amazed by people who think its okay to do that.", "Sounds like your co workers respect you then", "Or that as well ha", "Did you ever get caught?", "Was she disappointed?", "How many month earlier he came?", "Is he healthy?"]
