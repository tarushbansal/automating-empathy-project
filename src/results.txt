pretrained_models/GOLD: I'm right there with you.. I still feel pretty introverted, but since coming to college, I've been forced to socialize more, and it's help me at least "fake it until I make it." I still prefer to be alone a lot of the time, but at least I can somewhat manage without making myself look dumb.
